# GEOMETOR Euclid

A digital reconstruction of Euclid's Elements for semantic discovery and dependency mapping.

## Overview

`geometor.euclid` focuses on the "semantic discovery" of the original text of Euclid's *Elements*. It parses the classical Heath edition to create a structured knowledge base, enabling:

-   **Text Analysis**: Extracting and normalizing text from the source.
-   **Structure Identification**: Identifying definitions, postulates, axioms, and propositions.
-   **Dependency Mapping**: Tracing the logical prerequisites between elements.
-   **Semantic Tagging**: Identifying key concepts and relationships within the text.
-   **Keyword Discovery**: Extracting terms from the original index and performing manual analysis of definitions to build a comprehensive keyword vocabulary.

## Key Repos

-   **euclid**: This repository. Code for parsing and structuring the text.
-   **elements**: The project that builds upon this structure to create the G index and symbolic models.
