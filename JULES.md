# JULES

This project is an initiative to formalize the principles of Euclid's Elements within the GEOMETOR ecosystem. While the broader `geometor/euclid` repository aims to model and render all of Euclid's Elements in the interactive GEOMETOR Explorer, the JULES project has a more focused scope.

## GEOMETOR Context

The GEOMETOR project is a collection of Python libraries for creating, analyzing, and visualizing geometric constructions. The core components include:

-   **geometor.model**: A library for creating symbolic models of geometric constructions.
-   **geometor.explorer**: A web-based UI for the model, using Flask and SVG for interactive exploration.
-   **geometor.divine**: A tool for analyzing geometric relationships, such as the golden ratio, within constructions.

The ultimate goal of `geometor/euclid` is to represent Euclid's proofs as interactive constructions in the Explorer. This requires a formal understanding of the definitions, postulates, and propositions, as well as their dependencies.

## JULES Scope

The JULES project will focus on the following:

1.  **Formalization**: Translating the text of Euclid's Elements into a more structured and machine-readable format.
2.  **Dependency Mapping**: Identifying the dependency chain between definitions, postulates, and propositions.
3.  **Content Transformation**: Converting the existing markdown-based content from the `.archive` into reStructuredText (RST) within a new `docsrc/elements2` directory. This will involve:
    -   Retitling propositions for clarity.
    -   Establishing a consistent categorization and linking system.
    -   Integrating with Sphinx for documentation generation.

This work will lay the foundation for the broader goal of rendering Euclid's Elements in the GEOMETOR Explorer, but it will not encompass the full scope of the `geometor/euclid` repository.
