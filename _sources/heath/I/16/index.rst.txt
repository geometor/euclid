   In any triangle, if one of the sides be produced, the exterior angle is greater than either of the interior and opposite angles.

Let ``ABC`` be a triangle, and let one side of it ``BC`` be produced to ``D``; 

I say that the exterior angle ``ACD`` is greater than either of the interior and opposite angles ``CBA``, ``BAC``.

Let ``AC`` be bisected at ``E`` [:ref:`I.10 <I.10>`], and let ``BE`` be joined and produced in a straight line to ``F``; 

let ``EF`` be made equal to ``BE``[:ref:`I.3 <I.3>`], let ``FC`` be joined [:ref:`I.post.1 <I.post.1>`], and let ``AC`` be drawn through to ``G`` [:ref:`I.post.2 <I.post.2>`].

Then, since ``AE`` is equal to ``EC``, and ``BE`` to ``EF``, the two sides ``AE``, ``EB`` are equal to the two sides ``CE``, ``EF`` respectively; and the angle ``AEB`` is equal to the angle ``FEC``, for they are vertical angles. [:ref:`I.15 <I.15>`] Therefore the base ``AB`` is equal to the base ``FC``, and the triangle ``ABE`` is equal to the triangle ``CFE``, and the remaining angles are equal to the remaining angles respectively, namely those which the equal sides subtend; [:ref:`I.4 <I.4>`] therefore the angle ``BAE`` is equal to the angle ``ECF``.
        

But the angle ``ECD`` is greater than the angle ``ECF``; [C. N. 5] therefore the angle ``ACD`` is greater than the angle ``BAE``.

Similarly also, if ``BC`` be bisected, the angle ``BCG``, that is, the angle ``ACD`` [:ref:`I.15 <I.15>`], can be proved greater than the angle ``ABC`` as well.

Therefore etc.
