I.2

   To place at a given point (as an extremity) a straight line equal to a given straight line.

Let ``A`` be the given point, and ``BC`` the given straight line.

Thus it is required to place at the point ``A`` (as an extremity) a straight line equal to the given straight line ``BC``. 

From the point ``A`` to the point ``B`` let the straight line ``AB`` be joined; [:ref:`I.post.1 <I.post.1>`] and on it let the equilateral triangle ``DAB`` be constructed. [:ref:`I.1 <I.1>`]

Let the straight lines ``AE``, ``BF`` be produced in a straight line with ``DA``, ``DB``; [:ref:`I.post.2 <I.post.2>`] with centre ``B`` and distance ``BC`` let the circle ``CGH`` be described; [:ref:`I.post.3 <I.post.3>`] and again, with centre ``D`` and distance ``DG`` let the circle ``GKL`` be described. [:ref:`I.post.3 <I.post.3>`]

Then, since the point ``B`` is the centre of the circle ``CGH``, ``BC`` is equal to ``BG``.
        

Again, since the point ``D`` is the centre of the circle ``GKL``, ``DL`` is equal to ``DG``.

And in these ``DA`` is equal to ``DB``; therefore the remainder ``AL`` is equal to the remainder ``BG.`` [:ref:`I.cn.3 <I.cn.3>`]
        

But ``BC`` was also proved equal to ``BG``; therefore each of the straight lines ``AL``, ``BC`` is equal to ``BG``.

And things which are equal to the same thing are also equal to one another; [:ref:`I.cn.1 <I.cn.1>`] therefore ``AL`` is also equal to ``BC``.

Therefore at the given point ``A`` the straight line ``AL`` is placed equal to the given straight line ``BC``.


**Q. E. D.**


(Being) what it was required to do.


.. note::


   **1. (as an extremity).**

   

   I have inserted these words because to place a straight line ``at`` a given point

    (πρὸς τῷ δοθέντι σημείῳ) is not quite clear enough, at least in English.


.. note::


   **11. Let the straight lines AE, BF be produced....**

   

   It will be observed that in this first application of :ref:`I.post.2 <I.post.2>`, and again in :ref:`I.5 <I.5>`, Euclid speaks of the ``continuation`` of the straight line as that which is produced in such cases, ἐκβεβλήσθωσαν and προσεκβεβλήσθωσαν meaning little more than ``drawing`` straight lines in a straight line with

    the given straight lines. The first place in which Euclid uses phraseology exactly corresponding to ours when speaking of a straight line being produced is in :ref:`I.16 <I.16>`: let one side of it, ``BC``, be produced to ``D``

    (προσεκβεβλήσθω αὐτοῦ μία πλευρὰ ἡ ΒΓ ἐπὶ τὸ Δ).


.. note::


   **23. the remainder AL...the remainder BG.**

   

   The Greek expressions are λοιπὴ ἡ ΑΛ and λοιπῇ τῇ BH, and the literal translation would be ``AL`` (or ``BG``) ``remaining``,

    but the shade of meaning conveyed by the position of the definite article can hardly be expressed in English.
