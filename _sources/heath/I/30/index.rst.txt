   Straight lines parallel to the same straight line are also parallel to one another.

Let each of the straight lines ``AB``, ``CD`` be parallel to ``EF``; I say that ``AB`` is also parallel to ``CD``. 

For let the straight line ``GK`` fall upon them; 

Then, since the straight line ``GK`` has fallen on the parallel straight lines ``AB``, ``EF``, the angle ``AGK`` is equal to the angle ``GHF``. [:ref:`I.29 <I.29>`]

Again, since the straight line ``GK`` has fallen on the parallel straight lines ``EF``, ``CD``, the angle ``GHF`` is equal to the angle ``GKD``. [:ref:`I.29 <I.29>`]
        

But the angle ``AGK`` was also proved equal to the angle ``GHF``; therefore the angle ``AGK`` is also equal to the angle ``GKD``; [:ref:`I.cn.1 <I.cn.1>`] and they are alternate. 

Therefore ``AB`` is parallel to ``CD``.

   The usual ``conclusion`` in general terms (Therefore etc.
