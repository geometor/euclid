   Equal triangles which are on equal bases and on the same side are also in the same parallels.

Let ``ABC``, ``CDE`` be equal triangles on equal bases ``BC``, ``CE`` and on the same side.

I say that they are also in the same parallels.

For let ``AD`` be joined; I say that ``AD`` is parallel to ``BE``.

For, if not, let ``AF`` be drawn through ``A`` parallel to ``BE`` [:ref:`I.31 <I.31>`], and let ``FE`` be joined.

Therefore the triangle ``ABC`` is equal to the triangle ``FCE``; for they are on equal bases ``BC``, ``CE`` and in the same parallels ``BE``, ``AF``. [:ref:`I.38 <I.38>`]

But the triangle ``ABC`` is equal to the triangle ``DCE``;


.. container:: center

   therefore the triangle ``DCE`` is also equal to the triangle ``FCE``, [:ref:`I.cn.1 <I.cn.1>`] the greater to the less: which is impossible. Therefore ``AF`` is not parallel to ``BE``.


Similarly we can prove that neither is any other straight line except ``AD``;


.. container:: center

   therefore ``AD`` is parallel to ``BE``.


Therefore etc. Q. E. D.]
