   The straight line drawn at right angles to the diameter of a circle from its extremity will fall outside the circle, and into the space between the straight line and the circumference another straight line cannot be interposed; further the angle of the semicircle is greater, and the remaining angle less, than any acute rectilineal angle.

Let ``ABC`` be a circle about ``D`` as centre and ``AB`` as diameter; I say that the straight line drawn from ``A`` at right angles to ``AB`` from its extremity will fall outside the circle.

For suppose it does not, but, if possible, let it fall within as ``CA``, and let ``DC`` be joined.

Since ``DA`` is equal to ``DC``,


.. container:: center

   the angle ``DAC`` is also equal to the angle ``ACD``. [:ref:`I.5 <I.5>`]


But the angle ``DAC`` is right;


.. container:: center

   therefore the angle ``ACD`` is also right:


thus, in the triangle ``ACD``, the two angles ``DAC``, ``ACD`` are equal to two right angles: which is impossible. [:ref:`I.17 <I.17>`]

Therefore the straight line drawn from the point ``A`` at right angles to ``BA`` will not fall within the circle.

Similarly we can prove that neither will it fall on the circumference;


.. container:: center

   therefore it will fall outside.


Let it fall as ``AE``; I say next that into the space between the straight line ``AE`` and the circumference ``CHA`` another straight line cannot be interposed.

For, if possible, let another straight line be so interposed, as ``FA``, and let ``DG`` be drawn from the point ``D`` perpendicular to ``FA``.

Then, since the angle ``AGD`` is right,


.. container:: center

   and the angle ``DAG`` is less than a right angle, ``AD`` is greater than ``DG``. [:ref:`I.19 <I.19>`]


But ``DA`` is equal to ``DH``;


.. container:: center

   therefore ``DH`` is greater than ``DG``, the less than the greater: which is impossible.


Therefore another straight line cannot be interposed into the space between the straight line and the circumference.

I say further that the angle of the semicircle contained by the straight line ``BA`` and the circumference ``CHA`` is greater than any acute rectilineal angle, and the remaining angle contained by the circumference ``CHA`` and the straight line ``AE`` is less than any acute rectilineal angle.

For, if there is any rectilineal angle greater than the angle contained by the straight line ``BA`` and the circumference ``CHA``, and any rectilineal angle less than the angle contained by the circumference ``CHA`` and the straight line ``AE``, then into the space between the circumference and the straight line ``AE`` a straight line will be interposed such as will make an angle contained by straight lines which is greater than the angle contained by the straight line ``BA`` and the circumference ``CHA``, and another angle contained by straight lines which is less than the angle contained by the circumference ``CHA`` and the straight line ``AE``.

But such a straight line cannot be interposed;

therefore there will not be any acute angle contained by straight lines which is greater than the angle contained by the straight line ``BA`` and the circumference ``CHA``, nor yet any acute angle contained by straight lines which is less than the angle contained by the circumference ``CHA`` and the straight line ``AE``.—
