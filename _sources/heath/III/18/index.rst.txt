III.18
======

   If a straight line touch a circle, and a straight line be joined from the centre to the point of contact, the straight line so joined will be perpendicular to the tangent.

For let a straight line ``DE`` touch the circle ``ABC`` at the point ``C``, let the centre ``F`` of the circle ``ABC`` be taken, and let ``FC`` be joined from ``F`` to ``C``; I say that ``FC`` is perpendicular to ``DE``.

For, if not, let ``FG`` be drawn from ``F`` perpendicular to ``DE``.

Then, since the angle ``FGC`` is right,


.. container:: center

   the angle ``FCG`` is acute; [:ref:`I.17 <I.17>`]


and the greater angle is subtended by the greater side; [:ref:`I.19 <I.19>`]


.. container:: center

   therefore ``FC`` is greater than ``FG``.


But ``FC`` is equal to ``FB``;


.. container:: center

   therefore ``FB`` is also greater than ``FG``, the less than the greater: which is impossible.


Therefore ``FG`` is not perpendicular to ``DE``.

Similarly we can prove that neither is any other straight line except ``FC``;


.. container:: center

   therefore ``FC`` is perpendicular to ``DE``.
