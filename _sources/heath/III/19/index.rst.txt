III.19
======

   If a straight line touch a circle, and from the point of contact a straight line be drawn at right angles to the tangent, the centre of the circle will be on the straight line so drawn.

For let a straight line ``DE`` touch the circle ``ABC`` at the point ``C``, and from ``C`` let ``CA`` be drawn at right angles to ``DE``; I say that the centre of the circle is on ``AC``.

For suppose it is not, but, if

possible, let ``F`` be the centre, and let ``CF`` be joined.

Since a straight line ``DE`` touches the circle ``ABC``, and ``FC`` has been joined from the centre to the point of contact,


.. container:: center

   ``FC`` is perpendicular to ``DE``; [:ref:`III.18 <III.18>`] therefore the angle ``FCE`` is right.


But the angle ``ACE`` is also right;


.. container:: center

   therefore the angle ``FCE`` is equal to the angle ``ACE``, the less to the greater: which is impossible.


Therefore ``F`` is not the centre of the circle ``ABC``.

Similarly we can prove that neither is any other point except a point on ``AC``.

Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
