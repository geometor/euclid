III.2
=====

   If on the circumference of a circle two points be taken at random, the straight line joining the points will fall within the circle.

Let ``ABC`` be a circle, and let two points ``A``, ``B`` be taken at random on its circumference; I say that the straight line joined from ``A`` to ``B`` will fall within the circle.

For suppose it does not, but, if possible, let it fall outside, as ``AEB``; let the centre of the circle ``ABC`` be taken [:ref:`III.1 <III.1>`], and let it be ``D``; let ``DA``, ``DB`` be joined, and let ``DFE`` be drawn through.

Then, since ``DA`` is equal to ``DB``,


.. container:: center

   the angle ``DAE`` is also equal to the angle ``DBE``. [:ref:`I.5 <I.5>`]


And, since one side ``AEB`` of the triangle ``DAE`` is produced,


.. container:: center

   the angle ``DEB`` is greater than the angle ``DAE``. [:ref:`I.16 <I.16>`]


But the angle ``DAE`` is equal to the angle ``DBE``;


.. container:: center

   therefore the angle ``DEB`` is greater than the angle ``DBE``.


And the greater angle is subtended by the greater side; [:ref:`I.19 <I.19>`]


.. container:: center

   therefore ``DB`` is greater than ``DE``. But ``DB`` is equal to ``DF``;



.. container:: center

   therefore ``DF`` is greater than ``DE``,



.. container:: center

   the less than the greater : which is impossible.


Therefore the straight line joined from ``A`` to ``B`` will not fall outside the circle.

Similarly we can prove that neither will it fall on the circumference itself;


.. container:: center

   therefore it will fall within.


Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
