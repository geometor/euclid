III.21
======

   In a circle the angles in the same segment are equal to one another.

Let ``ABCD`` be a circle, and let the angles ``BAD``, ``BED`` be angles in the same segment ``BAED``; I say that the angles ``BAD``, ``BED`` are equal to one another.

For let the centre of the circle ``ABCD`` be taken, and let it be ``F``; let

``BF``, ``FD`` be joined.

Now, since the angle ``BFD`` is at the centre,


.. container:: center

   and the angle ``BAD`` at the circumference, and they have the same circumference ``BCD`` as base, therefore the angle ``BFD`` is double of the angle ``BAD``. [:ref:`III.20 <III.20>`]


For the same reason


.. container:: center

   the angle ``BFD`` is also double of the angle ``BED``; therefore the angle ``BAD`` is equal to the angle ``BED``.


Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
