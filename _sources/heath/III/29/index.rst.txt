III.29
======

   In equal circles equal circumferences are subtended by equal straight lines.

Let ``ABC``, ``DEF`` be equal circles, and in them let equal circumferences ``BGC``, ``EHF`` be cut off; and let the straight lines ``BC``, ``EF`` be joined; I say that ``BC`` is equal to ``EF``.

For let the centres of the circles be taken, and let them be ``K``, ``L``; let ``BK``, ``KC``, ``EL``, ``LF`` be joined.

Now, since the circumference ``BGC`` is equal to the circumference ``EHF``,


.. container:: center

   the angle ``BKC`` is also equal to the angle ``ELF``. [:ref:`III.27 <III.27>`]


And, since the circles ``ABC``, ``DEF`` are equal,


.. container:: center

   the radii are also equal; therefore the two sides ``BK``, ``KC`` are equal to the two sides ``EL``, ``LF``; and they contain equal angles; therefore the base ``BC`` is equal to the base ``EF``. [:ref:`I.4 <I.4>`]


Therefore etc.
