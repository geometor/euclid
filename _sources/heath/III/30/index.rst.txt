   To bisect a given circumference.

Let ``ADB`` be the given circumference; thus it is required to bisect the circumference ``ADB``.

Let ``AB`` be joined and bisected at ``C``; from the point ``C`` let ``CD`` be drawn at right angles to the straight line ``AB``,

and let ``AD``, ``DB`` be joined.

Then, since ``AC`` is equal to ``CB``, and ``CD`` is common,


.. container:: center

   the two sides ``AC``, ``CD`` are equal to the two sides ``BC``, ``CD``;


and the angle ``ACD`` is equal to the angle ``BCD``, for each is right;


.. container:: center

   therefore the base ``AD`` is equal to the base ``DB``. [:ref:`I.4 <I.4>`]


But equal straight lines cut off equal circumferences, the greater equal to the greater, and the less to the less; [:ref:`III.28 <III.28>`]


.. container:: center

   and each of the circumferences ``AD``, ``DB`` is less than a semicircle; therefore the circumference ``AD`` is equal to the circumference ``DB``.


Therefore the given circumference has been bisected at the point ``D``. Q. E. F.
