   If a straight line touch a circle, and from the point of contact there be drawn across, in the circle, a straight line cutting the circle, the angles which it makes with the tangent will be equal to the angles in the alternate segments of the circle.

For let a straight line ``EF`` touch the circle ``ABCD`` at the point ``B``, and from the point ``B`` let there be drawn across, in the circle ``ABCD``, a straight line ``BD`` cutting it; I say that the angles which ``BD`` makes with the tangent ``EF`` will be equal to the angles in the alternate segments of the circle, that is, that the angle ``FBD`` is equal to the angle constructed in the segment ``BAD``, and the angle ``EBD`` is equal to the angle constructed in the segment ``DCB``.

For let ``BA`` be drawn from ``B`` at right angles to ``EF``, let a point ``C`` be taken at random on the circumference ``BD``,

and let ``AD``, ``DC``, ``CB`` be joined.

Then, since a straight line ``EF`` touches the circle ``ABCD`` at ``B``, and ``BA`` has been drawn from the point of contact at right angles to the tangent, the centre of the circle ``ABCD`` is on ``BA``. [:ref:`III.19 <III.19>`]

Therefore ``BA`` is a diameter of the circle ``ABCD``;


.. container:: center

   therefore the angle ``ADB``, being an angle in a semicircle, is right. [:ref:`III.31 <III.31>`]


Therefore the remaining angles ``BAD``, ``ABD`` are equal to one right angle. [:ref:`I.32 <I.32>`]

But the angle ``ABF`` is also right; therefore the angle ``ABF`` is equal to the angles ``BAD``, ``ABD``.

Let the angle ``ABD`` be subtracted from each; therefore the angle ``DBF`` which remains is equal to the angle ``BAD`` in the alternate segment of the circle.

Next, since ``ABCD`` is a quadrilateral in a circle, its opposite angles are equal to two right angles. [:ref:`III.22 <III.22>`]

But the angles ``DBF``, ``DBE`` are also equal to two right angles; therefore the angles ``DBF``, ``DBE`` are equal to the angles ``BAD``, ``BCD``,


.. container:: center

   of which the angle ``BAD`` was proved equal to the angle ``DBF``; therefore the angle ``DBE`` which remains is equal to the angle ``DCB`` in the alternate segment ``DCB`` of the circle.


Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
