   On a given straight line to describe a segment of a circle admitting an angle equal to a given rectilineal angle.

Let ``AB`` be the given straight line, and the angle at ``C`` the given rectilineal angle; thus it is required to describe on the given straight line ``AB`` a segment of a circle admitting an angle equal to the angle at ``C``.

The angle at ``C`` is then acute, or right, or obtuse.

First let it be acute, and, as in the first figure, on the straight line ``AB``, and at the point ``A``, let the angle ``BAD`` be constructed equal to the angle at ``C``;


.. container:: center

   therefore the angle ``BAD`` is also acute.


Let ``AE`` be drawn at right angles to ``DA``, let ``AB`` be bisected at ``F``, let ``FG`` be drawn from the point ``F`` at right angles to ``AB``, and let ``GB`` be joined.

Then, since ``AF`` is equal to ``FB``, and ``FG`` is common,


.. container:: center

   the two sides ``AF``, ``FG`` are equal to the two sides ``BF``, ``FG``;


and the angle ``AFG`` is equal to the angle ``BFG``;


.. container:: center

   therefore the base ``AG`` is equal to the base ``BG``. [:ref:`I.4 <I.4>`]


Therefore the circle described with centre ``G`` and distance ``GA`` will pass through ``B`` also.

Let it be drawn, and let it be ``ABE``; let ``EB`` be joined.

Now, since ``AD`` is drawn from ``A``, the extremity of the diameter ``AE``, at right angles to ``AE``,


.. container:: center

   therefore ``AD`` touches the circle ``ABE``. [:ref:`III.16.p.1 <III.16.p.1>`]


Since then a straight line ``AD`` touches the circle ``ABE``, and from the point of contact at ``A`` a straight line ``AB`` is drawn across in the circle ``ABE``,


.. container:: center

   the angle ``DAB`` is equal to the angle ``AEB`` in the alternate segment of the circle. [:ref:`III.32 <III.32>`]


But the angle ``DAB`` is equal to the angle at ``C``; therefore the angle at ``C`` is also equal to the angle ``AEB``.

Therefore on the given straight line ``AB`` the segment ``AEB`` of a circle has been described admitting the angle ``AEB`` equal to the given angle, the angle at ``C``.

Next let the angle at ``C`` be right;

and let it be again required to describe on ``AB`` a segment of a circle admitting an angle equal to the right angle at ``C``.

Let the angle ``BAD`` be constructed equal to the right angle at ``C``, as is the case in the second figure; let ``AB`` be bisected at ``F``, and with centre ``F`` and distance either ``FA`` or ``FB`` let the circle ``AEB`` be described.

Therefore the straight line ``AD`` touches the circle ``ABE``, because the angle at ``A`` is right. [:ref:`III.16.p.1 <III.16.p.1>`]

And the angle ``BAD`` is equal to the angle in the segment ``AEB``, for the latter too is itself a right angle, being an angle in a semicircle. [:ref:`III.31 <III.31>`]

But the angle ``BAD`` is also equal to the angle at ``C``.

Therefore the angle ``AEB`` is also equal to the angle at ``C``.

Therefore again the segment ``AEB`` of a circle has been described on ``AB`` admitting an angle equal to the angle at ``C``.

Next, let the angle at ``C`` be obtuse;

and on the straight line ``AB``, and at the point ``A``, let the angle ``BAD`` be constructed equal to it, as is the case in the third figure; let ``AE`` be drawn at right angles to ``AD``, let ``AB`` be again bisected at ``F``, let ``FG`` be drawn at right angles to ``AB``, and let ``GB`` be joined.

Then, since ``AF`` is again equal to ``FB``, and ``FG`` is common,


.. container:: center

   the two sides ``AF``, ``FG`` are equal to the two sides ``BF``, ``FG``;


and the angle ``AFG`` is equal to the angle ``BFG``;


.. container:: center

   therefore the base ``AG`` is equal to the base ``BG``. [:ref:`I.4 <I.4>`]


Therefore the circle described with centre ``G`` and distance ``GA`` will pass through ``B`` also; let it so pass, as ``AEB``.

Now, since ``AD`` is drawn at right angles to the diameter ``AE`` from its extremity,


.. container:: center

   ``AD`` touches the circle ``AEB``. [:ref:`III.16.p.1 <III.16.p.1>`]


And ``AB`` has been drawn across from the point of contact at ``A``;


.. container:: center

   therefore the angle ``BAD`` is equal to the angle constructed in the alternate segment ``AHB`` of the circle. [:ref:`III.32 <III.32>`]


But the angle ``BAD`` is equal to the angle at ``C``.

Therefore the angle in the segment ``AHB`` is also equal to the angle at ``C``.

Therefore on the given straight line ``AB`` the segment ``AHB`` of a circle has been described admitting an angle equal to the angle at ``C``. Q. E. F.
