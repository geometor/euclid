   To construct an isosceles triangle having each of the angles at the base double of the remaining one.

``To construct an isosceles triangle having each of the angles at the base double of the remaining one``.

Let any straight line ``AB`` be set out, and let it be cut at the point ``C`` so that the rectangle contained by ``AB``, ``BC`` is equal to the square on ``CA``; [:ref:`II.11 <II.11>`] with centre ``A`` and distance ``AB`` let the circle ``BDE`` be described, and let there be fitted in the circle ``BDE`` the straight line ``BD`` equal to the straight line ``AC`` which is not greater than the diameter of the circle ``BDE``. [:ref:`IV.1 <IV.1>`]

Let ``AD``, ``DC`` be joined, and let the circle ``ACD`` be circumscribed about the triangle ``ACD``. [:ref:`IV.5 <IV.5>`]

Then, since the rectangle ``AB``, ``BC`` is equal to the square on ``AC``, and ``AC`` is equal to ``BD``, therefore the rectangle ``AB``, ``BC`` is equal to the square on ``BD``.

And, since a point ``B`` has been taken outside the circle ``ACD``, and from ``B`` the two straight lines ``BA``, ``BD`` have fallen on the circle ``ACD``, and one of them cuts it, while the other falls on it, and the rectangle ``AB``, ``BC`` is equal to the square on ``BD``,


.. container:: center

   therefore ``BD`` touches the circle ``ACD``. [:ref:`III.37 <III.37>`]


Since, then, ``BD`` touches it, and ``DC`` is drawn across from the point of contact at ``D``, therefore the angle ``BDC`` is equal to the angle ``DAC`` in the alternate segment of the circle. [:ref:`III.32 <III.32>`]

Since, then, the angle ``BDC`` is equal to the angle ``DAC``, let the angle ``CDA`` be added to each; therefore the whole angle ``BDA`` is equal to the two angles ``CDA``, ``DAC``.

But the exterior angle ``BCD`` is equal to the angles ``CDA``, ``DAC``; [:ref:`I.32 <I.32>`] therefore the angle ``BDA`` is also equal to the angle ``BCD``.

But the angle ``BDA`` is equal to the angle ``CBD``, since the side ``AD`` is also equal to ``AB``; [:ref:`I.5 <I.5>`] so that the angle ``DBA`` is also equal to the angle ``BCD``.

Therefore the three angles ``BDA``, ``DBA``, ``BCD`` are equal to one another.

And, since the angle ``DBC`` is equal to the angle ``BCD``,


.. container:: center

   the side ``BD`` is also equal to the side ``DC``. [:ref:`I.6 <I.6>`]


But ``BD`` is by hypothesis equal to ``CA``; therefore ``CA`` is also equal to ``CD``,


.. container:: center

   so that the angle ``CDA`` is also equal to the angle ``DAC``; [:ref:`I.5 <I.5>`]


therefore the angles ``CDA``, ``DAC`` are double of the angle ``DAC``.

But the angle ``BCD`` is equal to the angles ``CDA``, ``DAC``; therefore the angle ``BCD`` is also double of the angle ``CAD``.

But the angle ``BCD`` is equal to each of the angles ``BDA``, ``DBA``; therefore each of the angles ``BDA``, ``DBA`` is also double of the angle ``DAB``.

Therefore the isosceles triangle ``ABD`` has been constructed having each of the angles at the base ``DB`` double of the remaining one. Q. E. F.
