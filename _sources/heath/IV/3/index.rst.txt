   About a given circle to circumscribe a triangle equiangular with a given triangle.

Let ``ABC`` be the given circle, and ``DEF`` the given triangle; thus it is required to circumscribe about the circle ``ABC`` a triangle equiangular with the triangle ``DEF``.

Let ``EF`` be produced in both directions to the points ``G``, ``H``, let the centre ``K`` of the circle ``ABC`` be taken [:ref:`III.1 <III.1>`], and let the straight line ``KB`` be drawn across at random; on the straight line ``KB``, and at the point ``K`` on it, let the angle ``BKA`` be constructed equal to the angle ``DEG``, and the angle ``BKC`` equal to the angle ``DFH``; [:ref:`I.23 <I.23>`] and through the points ``A``, ``B``, ``C`` let ``LAM``, ``MBN``, ``NCL`` be drawn touching the circle ``ABC``. [:ref:`III.16.p.1 <III.16.p.1>`]

Now, since ``LM``, ``MN``, ``NL`` touch the circle ``ABC`` at the points ``A``, ``B``, ``C``, and ``KA``, ``KB``, ``KC`` have been joined from the centre ``K`` to the points ``A``, ``B``, ``C``, therefore the angles at the points ``A``, ``B``, ``C`` are right. [:ref:`III.18 <III.18>`]

And, since the four angles of the quadrilateral ``AMBK`` are equal to four right angles, inasmuch as ``AMBK`` is in fact divisible into two triangles,


.. container:: center

   and the angles ``KAM``, ``KBM`` are right,


therefore the remaining angles ``AKB``, ``AMB`` are equal to two right angles.

But the angles ``DEG``, ``DEF`` are also equal to two right angles; [:ref:`I.13 <I.13>`] therefore the angles ``AKB``, ``AMB`` are equal to the angles ``DEG``, ``DEF``, of which the angle ``AKB`` is equal to the angle ``DEG``;


.. container:: center

   therefore the angle ``AMB`` which remains is equal to the angle ``DEF`` which remains.


Similarly it can be proved that the angle ``LNB`` is also equal to the angle ``DFE``;


.. container:: center

   therefore the remaining angle ``MLN`` is equal to the angle ``EDF``. [:ref:`I.32 <I.32>`]


Therefore the triangle ``LMN`` is equiangular with the triangle ``DEF``; and it has been circumscribed about the circle ``ABC``.

Therefore about a given circle there has been circumscribed a triangle equiangular with the given triangle. Q. E. F.
