   In a given circle to inscribe a square.

``In a given circle to inscribe a square``.

Let ``ABCD`` be the given circle; thus it is required to inscribe a square in the circle ``ABCD``.

Let two diameters ``AC``, ``BD`` of the circle ``ABCD`` be drawn at right angles to one another, and let ``AB``, ``BC``, ``CD``, ``DA`` be joined.

Then, since ``BE`` is equal to ``ED``, for ``E`` is the centre, and ``EA`` is common and at right angles, therefore the base ``AB`` is equal to the base ``AD``. [:ref:`I.4 <I.4>`]

For the same reason each of the straight lines ``BC``, ``CD`` is also equal to each of the straight lines ``AB``, ``AD``;


.. container:: center

   therefore the quadrilateral ``ABCD`` is equilateral.


I say next that it is also right-angled.

For, since the straight line ``BD`` is a diameter of the circle ``ABCD``, therefore ``BAD`` is a semicircle;


.. container:: center

   therefore the angle ``BAD`` is right. [:ref:`III.31 <III.31>`]


For the same reason each of the angles ``ABC``, ``BCD``, ``CDA`` is also right;


.. container:: center

   therefore the quadrilateral ``ABCD`` is right-angled.


But it was also proved equilateral; therefore it is a square; [:ref:`I.def.22 <I.def.22>`] and it has been inscribed in the circle ``ABCD``.

Therefore in the given circle the square ``ABCD`` has been inscribed. Q. E. F.
