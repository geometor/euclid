   About a given square to circumscribe a circle.

Let ``ABCD`` be the given square; thus it is required to circumscribe a circle about the square ``ABCD``.

For let ``AC``, ``BD`` be joined, and let them cut one another at ``E``.

Then, since ``DA`` is equal to ``AB``, and ``AC`` is common, therefore the two sides ``DA``, ``AC`` are equal to the two sides ``BA``, ``AC``; and the base ``DC`` is equal to the base ``BC``;


.. container:: center

   therefore the angle ``DAC`` is equal to the angle ``BAC``. [:ref:`I.8 <I.8>`]


Therefore the angle ``DAB`` is bisected by ``AC``.

Similarly we can prove that each of the angles ``ABC``, ``BCD``, ``CDA`` is bisected by the straight lines ``AC``, ``DB``.

Now, since the angle ``DAB`` is equal to the angle ``ABC``, and the angle ``EAB`` is half the angle ``DAB``, and the angle ``EBA`` half the angle ``ABC``, therefore the angle ``EAB`` is also equal to the angle ``EBA``; so that the side ``EA`` is also equal to ``EB``. [:ref:`I.6 <I.6>`]

Similarly we can prove that each of the straight lines ``EA``, ``EB`` is equal to each of the straight lines ``EC``, ``ED``.

Therefore the four straight lines ``EA``, ``EB``, ``EC``, ``ED`` are equal to one another.

Therefore the circle described with centre ``E`` and distance one of the straight lines ``EA``, ``EB``, ``EC``, ``ED`` will pass also through the remaining points; and it will have been circumscribed about the square ``ABCD``.

Let it be circumscribed, as ``ABCD``.

Therefore about the given square a circle has been circumscribed. Q. E. F.
