   If from an odd number an even number be subtracted, the remainder will be odd.

For from the odd number AB let the even number BC be subtracted; I say that the remainder CA is odd.

Let the unit AD be subtracted; therefore DB is even. [:ref:`VII.def.7 <VII.def.7>`]

But BC is also even; therefore the remainder CD is even. [:ref:`IX.24 <IX.24>`]

Therefore CA is odd. [:ref:`VII.def.7 <VII.def.7>`] Q. E. D.
