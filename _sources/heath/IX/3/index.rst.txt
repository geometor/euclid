   If a cube number by multiplying itself make some number, the product will be cube.

For let the cube number A by multiplying itself make B; I say that B is cube.

For let C, the side of A, be taken, and let C by multiplying itself make D.

It is then manifest that C by multiplying D has made A.

Now, since C by multiplying itself has made D, therefore C measures D according to the units in itself.

But further the unit also measures C according to the units in it; therefore, as the unit is to C, so is C to D. [:ref:`VII.def.20 <VII.def.20>`]

Again, since C by multiplying D has made A, therefore D measures A according to the units in C.

But the unit also measures C according to the units in it; therefore, as the unit is to C, so is D to A.

But, as the unit is to C, so is C to D; therefore also, as the unit is to C, so is C to D, and D to A.

Therefore between the unit and the number A two mean proportional numbers C, D have fallen in continued proportion.

Again, since A by multiplying itself has made B, therefore A measures B according to the units in itself.

But the unit also measures A according to the units in it; therefore, as the unit is to A, so is A to B. [:ref:`VII.def.20 <VII.def.20>`]

But between the unit and A two mean proportional numbers have fallen; therefore two mean proportional numbers will also fall between A, B. [:ref:`VIII.8 <VIII.8>`]

But, if two mean proportional numbers fall between two numbers, and the first be cube, the second will also be cube. [:ref:`VIII.23 <VIII.23>`]

And A is cube; therefore B is also cube. Q. E. D.
