=====

   If a number neither be one of those which are continually doubled from a dyad, nor have its half odd, it is both eventimes even and even-times odd.

For let the number A neither be one of those doubled from a dyad, nor have its half odd; I say that A is both even-times even and even-times odd.

Now that A is even-times even is manifest; for it has not its half odd. [:ref:`VII.def.8 <VII.def.8>`]

I say next that it is also even-times odd.

For, if we bisect A, then bisect its half, and do this continually, we shall come upon some odd number which will measure A according to an even number.

For, if not, we shall come upon a dyad, and A will be among those which are doubled from a dyad: which is contrary to the hypothesis.

Thus A is even-times odd.

But it was also proved even-times even.

Therefore A is both even-times even and even-times odd. Q. E. D.
