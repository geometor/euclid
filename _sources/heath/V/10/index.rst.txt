   Of magnitudes which have a ratio to the same, that which has a greater ratio is greater; and that to which the same has a greater ratio is less.

For let ``A`` have to ``C`` a greater ratio than ``B`` has to ``C``; I say that ``A`` is greater than ``B``.

For, if not, ``A`` is either equal to ``B`` or less.

Now ``A`` is not equal to ``B``; for in that case each of the magnitudes ``A``, ``B`` would have had the same ratio to ``C``; [:ref:`V.7 <V.7>`] but they have not;


.. container:: center

   therefore ``A`` is not equal to ``B``.


Nor again is ``A`` less than ``B``; for in that case ``A`` would have had to ``C`` a less ratio than ``B`` has to ``C``; [:ref:`V.8 <V.8>`] but it has not;


.. container:: center

   therefore ``A`` is not less than ``B``.


But it was proved not to be equal either;


.. container:: center

   therefore ``A`` is greater than ``B``.


Again, let ``C`` have to ``B`` a greater ratio than ``C`` has to ``A``; I say that ``B`` is less than ``A``.

For, if not, it is either equal or greater.

Now ``B`` is not equal to ``A``; for in that case ``C`` would have had the same ratio to each of the magnitudes ``A``, ``B``; [:ref:`V.7 <V.7>`] but it has not;


.. container:: center

   therefore ``A`` is not equal to ``B``.


Nor again is ``B`` greater than ``A``; for in that case ``C`` would have had to ``B`` a less ratio than it has to ``A``; [:ref:`V.8 <V.8>`] but it has not;


.. container:: center

   therefore ``B`` is not greater than ``A``.


But it was proved that it is not equal either;


.. container:: center

   therefore ``B`` is less than ``A``.
