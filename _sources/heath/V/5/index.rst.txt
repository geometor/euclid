V.5
===

   If a magnitude be the same multiple of a magnitude that a part subtracted is of a part subtracted, the remainder will also be the same multiple of the remainder that the whole is of the whole.

For let the magnitude ``AB`` be the same multiple of the magnitude ``CD`` that the part ``AE`` subtracted is of the part ``CF`` subtracted; I say that the remainder ``EB`` is also the same multiple of the remainder ``FD`` that the whole ``AB`` is of the whole ``CD``.

For, whatever multiple ``AE`` is of ``CF``, let ``EB`` be made that multiple of ``CG``.

Then, since ``AE`` is the same multiple of ``CF`` that ``EB`` is of ``GC``, therefore ``AE`` is the same multiple of ``CF`` that ``AB`` is of ``GF``. [:ref:`V.1 <V.1>`]

But, by the assumption, ``AE`` is the same multiple of ``CF`` that ``AB`` is of ``CD``.

Therefore ``AB`` is the same multiple of each of the magnitudes ``GF``, ``CD``;

   therefore ``GF`` is equal to ``CD``.


Let ``CF`` be subtracted from each; therefore the remainder ``GC`` is equal to the remainder ``FD``.

And, since ``AE`` is the same multiple of ``CF`` that ``EB`` is of ``GC``, and ``GC`` is equal to ``DF``, therefore ``AE`` is the same multiple of ``CF`` that ``EB`` is of ``FD``.

But, by hypothesis,

``AE`` is the same multiple of ``CF`` that ``AB`` is of ``CD``; therefore ``EB`` is the same multiple of ``FD`` that ``AB`` is of ``CD``.

That is, the remainder ``EB`` will be the same multiple of the remainder ``FD`` that the whole ``AB`` is of the whole ``CD``.

Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
let EB be made that multiple of CG, τοσαυταπλάσιον γεγονέτω καὶ τὸ ΕΒ τοῦ ΓΗ. From this way of stating the construction one might suppose that ``CG`` was given and ``EB`` had to be found equal to a certain multiple of it. But in fact ``EB`` is what is given and ``CG`` has to be found, i.e. ``CG`` has to be constructed as a certain ``sub``multiple of ``EB``.
