   To a given straight line to apply a parallelogram equal to a given rectilineal figure and deficient by a parallelogrammic figure similar to a given one : thus the given rectilineal figure must not be greater than the parallelogram described on the half of the straight line and similar to the defect.

Let ``AB`` be the given straight line, ``C`` the given rectilineal figure to which the figure to be applied to ``AB`` is required to be equal, not being greater than the parallelogram described on the half of ``AB`` and similar to the defect, and ``D`` the parallelogram to which the defect is required to be similar; thus it is required to apply to the given straight line ``AB`` a parallelogram equal to the given rectilineal figure ``C`` and deficient by a parallelogrammic figure which is similar to ``D``.

Let ``AB`` be bisected at the point ``E``, and on ``EB`` let ``EBFG`` be described similar and similarly situated to ``D``; [:ref:`VI.18 <VI.18>`] let the parallelogram ``AG`` be completed.

If then ``AG`` is equal to ``C``, that which was enjoined will have been done;


.. container:: center

   for there has been applied to the given straight line ``AB`` the parallelogram ``AG`` equal to the given rectilineal figure ``C`` and deficient by a parallelogrammic figure ``GB`` which is similar to ``D``.


But, if not, let ``HE`` be greater than ``C``.

Now ``HE`` is equal to ``GB``;


.. container:: center

   therefore ``GB`` is also greater than ``C``.


Let ``KLMN`` be constructed at once equal to the excess by which ``GB`` is greater than ``C`` and similar and similarly situated to ``D``. [:ref:`VI.25 <VI.25>`]

But ``D`` is similar to ``GB``;


.. container:: center

   therefore ``KM`` is also similar to ``GB``. [:ref:`VI.21 <VI.21>`]


Let, then, ``KL`` correspond to ``GE``, and ``LM`` to ``GF``.

Now, since ``GB`` is equal to ``C``, ``KM``,


.. container:: center

   therefore ``GB`` is greater than ``KM``; therefore also ``GE`` is greater than ``KL``, and ``GF`` than ``LM``.


Let ``GO`` be made equal to ``KL``, and ``GP`` equal to ``LM``; and let the parallelogram ``OGPQ`` be completed;


.. container:: center

   therefore it is equal and similar to ``KM``.


Therefore ``GQ`` is also similar to ``GB``; [:ref:`VI.21 <VI.21>`] therefore ``GQ`` is about the same diameter with ``GB``. [:ref:`VI.26 <VI.26>`]

Let ``GQB`` be their diameter, and let the figure be described.

Then, since ``BG`` is equal to ``C``, ``KM``, and in them ``GQ`` is equal to ``KM``, therefore the remainder, the gnomon ``UWV``, is equal to the remainder ``C``.

And, since ``PR`` is equal to ``OS``,


.. container:: center

   let ``QB`` be added to each;


therefore the whole ``PB`` is equal to the whole ``OB``.

But ``OB`` is equal to ``TE``, since the side ``AE`` is also equal to the side ``EB``; [:ref:`I.36 <I.36>`]


.. container:: center

   therefore ``TE`` is also equal to ``PB``.


Let ``OS`` be added to each;


.. container:: center

   therefore the whole ``TS`` is equal to the whole, the gnomon ``VWU``.


But the gnomon ``VWU`` was proved equal to ``C``;


.. container:: center

   therefore ``TS`` is also equal to ``C``.


Therefore to the given straight line ``AB`` there has been applied the parallelogram ``ST`` equal to the given rectilineal figure ``C`` and deficient by a parallelogrammic figure ``QB`` which is similar to ``D``. Q. E. F.
