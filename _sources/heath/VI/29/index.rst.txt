VI.29
=====

   To a given straight line to apply a parallelogram equal to a given rectilineal figure and exceeding by a parallelogrammic figure similar to a given one.

Let ``AB`` be the given straight line, ``C`` the given rectilineal figure to which the figure to be applied to ``AB`` is required to be equal, and ``D`` that to which the excess is required to be similar; thus it is required to apply to the straight line ``AB`` a parallelogram equal to the rectilineal figure ``C`` and exceeding by a parallelogrammic figure similar to ``D``.

Let ``AB`` be bisected at ``E``; let there be described on ``EB`` the parallelogram ``BF`` similar and similarly situated to ``D``; and let ``GH`` be constructed at once equal to the sum of ``BF``, ``C`` and similar and similarly situated to ``D``. [:ref:`VI.25 <VI.25>`]

Let ``KH`` correspond to ``FL`` and ``KG`` to ``FE``.

Now, since ``GH`` is greater than ``FB``, therefore ``KH`` is also greater than ``FL``, and ``KG`` than ``FE``.

Let ``FL``, ``FE`` be produced, let ``FLM`` be equal to ``KH``, and ``FEN`` to ``KG``, and let ``MN`` be completed;


.. container:: center

   therefore ``MN`` is both equal and similar to ``GH``.


But ``GH`` is similar to ``EL``;


.. container:: center

   therefore ``MN`` is also similar to ``EL``; [:ref:`VI.21 <VI.21>`]


therefore ``EL`` is about the same diameter with ``MN``. [:ref:`VI.26 <VI.26>`]

Let their diameter ``FO`` be drawn, and let the figure be described.

Since ``GH`` is equal to ``EL``, ``C``, while ``GH`` is equal to ``MN``, therefore ``MN`` is also equal to ``EL``, ``C``.

Let ``EL`` be subtracted from each;


.. container:: center

   therefore the remainder, the gnomon ``XWV``, is equal to ``C``.


Now, since ``AE`` is equal to ``EB``,


.. container:: center

   ``AN`` is also equal to ``NB`` [:ref:`I.36 <I.36>`], that is, to ``LP`` [:ref:`I.43 <I.43>`].


Let ``EO`` be added to each;


.. container:: center

   therefore the whole ``AO`` is equal to the gnomon ``VWX``.


But the gnomon ``VWX`` is equal to ``C``;


.. container:: center

   therefore ``AO`` is also equal to ``C``.


Therefore to the given straight line ``AB`` there has been applied the parallelogram ``AO`` equal to the given rectilineal figure ``C`` and exceeding by a parallelogrammic figure ``QP`` which is similar to ``D``, since ``PQ`` is also similar to ``EL`` [:ref:`VI.24 <VI.24>`]. Q. E. F.
