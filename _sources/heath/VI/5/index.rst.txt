   If two triangles have their sides proportional, the triangles will be equiangular and will have those angles equal which the corresponding sides subtend.

Let ``ABC``, ``DEF`` be two triangles having their sides proportional, so that,


.. container:: center

   as ``AB`` is to ``BC``, so is ``DE`` to ``EF``, as ``BC`` is to ``CA``, so is ``EF`` to ``FD``,


and further, as ``BA`` is to ``AC``, so is ``ED`` to ``DF``; I say that the triangle ``ABC`` is equiangular with the triangle ``DEF``, and they will have those angles equal which the corresponding sides subtend, namely the angle ``ABC`` to the angle ``DEF``, the angle ``BCA`` to the angle ``EFD``, and further the angle ``BAC`` to the angle ``EDF``.

For on the straight line ``EF``, and at the points ``E``, ``F`` on it, let there be constructed the angle ``FEG`` equal to the angle ``ABC``, and the angle ``EFG`` equal to the angle ``ACB``; [:ref:`I.23 <I.23>`]


.. container:: center

   therefore the remaining angle at ``A`` is equal to the remaining angle at ``G``. [:ref:`I.32 <I.32>`]


Therefore the triangle ``ABC`` is equiangular with the triangle ``GEF``.

Therefore in the triangles ``ABC``, ``GEF`` the sides about the equal angles are proportional, and those are corresponding sides which subtend the equal angles; [:ref:`VI.4 <VI.4>`]


.. container:: center

   therefore, as ``AB`` is to ``BC``, so is ``GE`` to ``EF``.


But, as ``AB`` is to ``BC``, so by hypothesis is ``DE`` to ``EF``;


.. container:: center

   therefore, as ``DE`` is to ``EF``, so is ``GE`` to ``EF``. [:ref:`V.11 <V.11>`]


Therefore each of the straight lines ``DE``, ``GE`` has the same ratio to ``EF``;


.. container:: center

   therefore ``DE`` is equal to ``GE``. [:ref:`V.9 <V.9>`]


For the same reason


.. container:: center

   ``DF`` is also equal to ``GF``.


Since then ``DE`` is equal to ``EG``, and ``EF`` is common,


.. container:: center

   the two sides ``DE``, ``EF`` are equal to the two sides ``GE``, ``EF``; and the base ``DF`` is equal to the base ``FG``;


therefore the angle ``DEF`` is equal to the angle ``GEF``, [:ref:`I.8 <I.8>`] and the triangle ``DEF`` is equal to the triangle ``GEF``, and the remaining angles are equal to the remaining angles, namely those which the equal sides subtend. [:ref:`I.4 <I.4>`]

Therefore the angle ``DFE`` is also equal to the angle ``GFE``,


.. container:: center

   and the angle ``EDF`` to the angle ``EGF``.


And, since the angle ``FED`` is equal to the angle ``GEF``, while the angle ``GEF`` is equal to the angle ``ABC``, therefore the angle ``ABC`` is also equal to the angle ``DEF``.

For the same reason


.. container:: center

   the angle ``ACB`` is also equal to the angle ``DFE``,


and further, the angle at ``A`` to the angle at ``D``;


.. container:: center

   therefore the triangle ``ABC`` is equiangular with the triangle ``DEF``.


Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
