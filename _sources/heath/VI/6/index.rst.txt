   If two triangles have one angle equal to one angle and the sides about the equal angles proportional, the triangles will be equiangular and will have those angles equal which the corresponding sides subtend.

Let ``ABC``, ``DEF`` be two triangles having one angle ``BAC`` equal to one angle ``EDF`` and the sides about the equal angles proportional, so that,


.. container:: center

   as ``BA`` is to ``AC``, so is ``ED`` to ``DF``;


I say that the triangle ``ABC`` is equiangular with the triangle ``DEF``, and will have the angle ``ABC`` equal to the angle ``DEF``, and the angle ``ACB`` to the angle ``DFE``.

For on the straight line ``DF``, and at the points ``D``, ``F`` on it, let there be constructed the angle ``FDG`` equal to either of the angles ``BAC``, ``EDF``, and the angle ``DFG`` equal to the angle ``ACB``; [:ref:`I.23 <I.23>`]


.. container:: center

   therefore the remaining angle at ``B`` is equal to the remaining angle at ``G``. [:ref:`I.32 <I.32>`]


Therefore the triangle ``ABC`` is equiangular with the triangle ``DGF``.

Therefore, proportionally, as ``BA`` is to ``AC``, so is ``GD`` to ``DF``. [:ref:`VI.4 <VI.4>`]

But, by hypothesis, as ``BA`` is to ``AC``, so also is ``ED`` to ``DF``; therefore also, as ``ED`` is to ``DF``, so is ``GD`` to ``DF``. [:ref:`V.11 <V.11>`]

Therefore ``ED`` is equal to ``DG``; [:ref:`V.9 <V.9>`] and ``DF`` is common;


.. container:: center

   therefore the two sides ``ED``, ``DF`` are equal to the two sides ``GD``, ``DF``; and the angle ``EDF`` is equal to the angle ``GDF``; therefore the base ``EF`` is equal to the base ``GF``, and the triangle ``DEF`` is equal to the triangle ``DGF``,


and the remaining angles will be equal to the remaining angles, namely those which the equal sides subtend. [:ref:`I.4 <I.4>`]

Therefore the angle ``DFG`` is equal to the angle ``DFE``,


.. container:: center

   and the angle ``DGF`` to the angle ``DEF``.


But the angle ``DFG`` is equal to the angle ``ACB``; therefore the angle ``ACB`` is also equal to the angle ``DFE``.

And, by hypothesis, the angle ``BAC`` is also equal to the angle ``EDF``; therefore the remaining angle at ``B`` is also equal to the remaining angle at ``E``; [:ref:`I.32 <I.32>`]


.. container:: center

   therefore the triangle ``ABC`` is equiangular with the triangle ``DEF``.


Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
