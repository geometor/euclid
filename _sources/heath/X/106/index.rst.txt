   A straight line commensurable with that which produces with a rational area a medial whole is a straight line which produces with a rational area a medial whole.

Let AB be a straight line which produces with a rational area a medial whole, and CD commensurable with AB; I say that CD is also a straight line which produces with a rational area a medial whole.

For let BE be the annex to AB; therefore AE, EB are straight lines incommensurable in square which make the sum of the squares on AE, EB medial, but the rectangle contained by them rational. [:ref:`X.77 <X.77>`]

Let the same construction be made.

Then we can prove, in manner similar to the foregoing, that CF, FD are in the same ratio as AE, EB, the sum of the squares on AE, EB is commensurable with the sum of the squares on CF, FD, and the rectangle AE, EB with the rectangle CF, FD; so that CF, FD are also straight lines incommensurable in square which make the sum of the squares on CF, FD medial, but the rectangle contained by them rational.

Therefore CD is a straight line which produces with a rational area a medial whole. [:ref:`X.77 <X.77>`] Q. E. D.
