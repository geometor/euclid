   To find medial straight lines commensurable in square only which contain a rational rectangle.

Let two rational straight lines A, B commensurable in square only be set out; let C be taken a mean proportional between A, B, [:ref:`VI.13 <VI.13>`] and let it be contrived that,


.. container:: center

   as A is to B, so is C to D. [:ref:`VI.12 <VI.12>`]


Then, since A, B are rational and commensurable in square only, the rectangle A, B, that is, the square on C [:ref:`VI.17 <VI.17>`], is medial. [:ref:`X.21 <X.21>`]

Therefore C is medial. [:ref:`X.21 <X.21>`]

And since, as A is to B, so is C to D, and A, B are commensurable in square only, therefore C, D are also commensurable in square only. [:ref:`X.11 <X.11>`]

And C is medial; therefore D is also medial. [:ref:`X.23 <X.23>`, addition]

Therefore C, D are medial and commensurable in square only.

I say that they also contain a rational rectangle.

For since, as A is to B, so is C to D, therefore, alternately, as A is to C, so is B to D. [:ref:`V.16 <V.16>`]

But, as A is to C, so is C to B; therefore also, as C is to B, so is B to D; therefore the rectangle C, D is equal to the square on B.

But the square on B is rational; therefore the rectangle C, D is also rational.

Therefore medial straight lines commensurable in square only have been found which contain a rational rectangle. Q. E. D.
