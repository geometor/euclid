   To find two medial straight lines commensurable in square only, containing a rational rectangle, and such that the square on the greater is greater than the square on the less by the square on a straight line commensurable in length with the greater.

Let there be set out two rational straight lines A, B commensurable in square only and such that the square on A, being the greater, is greater than the square on B the less by the square on a straight line commensurable in length with A. [:ref:`X.29 <X.29>`]

And let the square on C be equal to the rectangle A, B.

Now the rectangle A, B is medial; [:ref:`X.21 <X.21>`] therefore the square on C is also medial; therefore C is also medial. [:ref:`X.21 <X.21>`]

Let the rectangle C, D be equal to the square on B.

Now the square on B is rational; therefore the rectangle C, D is also rational.

And since, as A is to B, so is the rectangle A, B to the square on B, while the square on C is equal to the rectangle A, B, and the rectangle C, D is equal to the square on B, therefore, as A is to B, so is the square on C to the rectangle C, D.

But, as the square on C is to the rectangle C, D, so is C to D; therefore also, as A is to B, so is C to D.

But A is commensurable with B in square only; therefore C is also commensurable with D in square only. [:ref:`X.11 <X.11>`]

And C is medial; therefore D is also medial. [:ref:`X.23 <X.23>`, addition]

And since, as A is to B, so is C to D, and the square on A is greater than the square on B by the square on a straight line commensurable with A, therefore also the square on C is greater than the square on D by the square on a straight line commensurable with C. [:ref:`X.14 <X.14>`]

Therefore two medial straight lines C, D, commensurable in square only and containing a rational rectangle, have been found, and the square on C is greater than the square on D by the square on a straight line commensurable in length with C.

Similarly also it can be proved that the square on C exceeds the square on D by the square on a straight line incommensurable with C, when the square on A is greater than the square on B by the square on a straight line incommensurable with A. [:ref:`X.30 <X.30>`]
