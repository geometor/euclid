   If two medial straight lines commensurable in square only and containing a rational rectangle be added together, the whole is irrational; and let it be called
          a first bimedial
          straight line.

For let two medial straight lines AB, BC commensurable in square only and containing a rational rectangle be added together;

I say that the whole AC is irrational.

For, since AB is incommensurable in length with BC, therefore the squares on AB, BC are also incommensurable with twice the rectangle AB, BC; [cf. :ref:`X.36 <X.36>`]
and, componendo, the squares on AB, BC together with twice the rectangle AB, BC, that is, the square on AC [:ref:`II.4 <II.4>`], is incommensurable with the rectangle AB, BC. [:ref:`X.16 <X.16>`
]

But the rectangle AB, BC is rational, for, by hypothesis, AB, BC are straight lines containing a rational rectangle; therefore the square on AC is irrational; therefore AC is irrational. [:ref:`X.def.4 <X.def.4>`
]

And let it be called a first bimedial straight line. Q. E. D.
