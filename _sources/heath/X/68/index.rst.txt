   A straight line commensurable with a major straight line is itself also major.

Let AB be major, and let CD be commensurable with AB; I say that CD is major.

Let AB be divided at E; therefore AE, EB are straight lines incommensurable in square which make the sum of the squares on them rational, but the rectangle contained by them medial. [:ref:`X.39 <X.39>`]

Let the same construction be made as before.

Then since, as AB is to CD, so is AE to CF, and EB to FD, therefore also, as AE is to CF, so is EB to FD. [:ref:`V.11 <V.11>`]

But AB is commensurable with CD; therefore AE, EB are also commensurable with CF, FD respectively. [:ref:`X.11 <X.11>`]

And since, as AE is to CF, so is EB to FD, alternately also, as AE is to EB, so is CF to FD; [:ref:`V.16 <V.16>`] therefore also, componendo, as AB is to BE, so is CD to DF; [:ref:`V.18 <V.18>`] therefore also, as the square on AB is to the square on BE, so is the square on CD to the square on DF. [:ref:`VI.20 <VI.20>`]

Similarly we can prove that, as the square on AB is to the square on AE, so also is the square on CD to the square on CF.

Therefore also, as the square on AB is to the squares on AE, EB, so is the square on CD to the squares on CF, FD; therefore also, alternately, as the square on AB is to the square on CD, so are the squares on AE, EB to the squares on CF, FD. [:ref:`V.16 <V.16>`]

But the square on AB is commensurable with the square on CD; therefore the squares on AE, EB are also commensurable with the squares on CF, FD.

And the squares on AE, EB together are rational; therefore the squares on CF, FD together are rational.

Similarly also twice the rectangle AE, EB is commensurable with twice the rectangle CF, FD.

And twice the rectangle AE, EB is medial; therefore twice the rectangle CF, FD is also medial. [:ref:`X.23.p.1 <X.23.p.1>`]

Therefore CF, FD are straight lines incommensurable in square which make, at the same time, the sum of the squares on them rational, but the rectangle contained by them medial; therefore the whole CD is the irrational straight line called major. [:ref:`X.39 <X.39>`]

Therefore a straight line commensurable with the major straight line is major. Q. E. D.
