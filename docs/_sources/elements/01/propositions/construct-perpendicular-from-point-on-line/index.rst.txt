Let `AB` be the given straight line, and `C` the given point on it. 

**PROBLEM:** draw from the point `C` a straight line at right angles to the straight line `AB`.

Let a point `D` be taken at random on `AC`; [1]_ let `CE` be made equal to `CD`; [I.3] on `DE` let the equilateral triangle `FDE` be constructed, [I.1] and let `FC` be joined; 

I say that the straight line `FC` has been drawn at right angles to the given straight line `AB` from `C` the given point on it.

For, since `DC` is equal to `CE`, and `CF` is common, 

- the two sides `DC`, `CF` are equal to the two sides `EC`, `CF` respectively;

and the base `DF` is equal to the base `FE`; 

- therefore the angle `DCF` is equal to the angle `ECF`; [I.8]

 and they are adjacent angles.

But, when a straight line set up on a straight line makes the adjacent angles equal to one another, each of the equal angles is right; [I.def.10] 

- therefore each of the angles `DCF`, `FCE` is right.

Therefore the straight line `CF` has been drawn at right angles to the given straight line `AB` from the given point `C` on it.
