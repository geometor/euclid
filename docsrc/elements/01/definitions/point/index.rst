   A **point** is that which has no part.

   -- Euclid


A point is the fundamental datum, representing a location on a field.

The location is specified by a collection of values, one value for each
dimension of the field. 

A plane as a two dimensional field contains points represented by two values.

These values are described as :math:`(x, y)` where values for :math:`x` and
:math:`y` can be integers, rational, or algebraic.

Examples of valid points on a plane:

.. math::
   (0, 0)\\
   (-3, \frac{8}{13})\\
   (\frac{\sqrt{5}}{2}, 1)
