construct line
==============

.. index:: line

..

  To draw a straight line from any point to any point.

  -- Euclid

In classic geometric construction, a line is drawn by scribing a drafting
instrument like a pencil or pen along a rule - a stright edge.  

In our system, lines are a projection, like a ray of light. 

In either case, to construct a line we require two points. Without these two
foundational points we can know nothing about the line. It is ungrounded or
unfounded.
