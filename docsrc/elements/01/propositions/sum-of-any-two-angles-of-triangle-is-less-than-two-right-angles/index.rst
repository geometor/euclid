  than two right angles.

Let `ABC` be a triangle; I say that two angles of the triangle `ABC` taken together in any manner are less than two right angles.

For let `BC` be produced to `D`. [I.post.2]

Then, since the angle `ACD` is an exterior angle of the triangle `ABC`,

it is greater than the interior and opposite angle `ABC`. [I.16] <pb n="282"/>

- Let the angle `ACB` be added to each;

therefore the angles `ACD`, `ACB` are greater than the angles `ABC`, `BCA`.  But the angles `ACD`, `ACB` are equal to two right angles. [I.13]

Therefore the angles `ABC`, `BCA` are less than two right angles.

Similarly we can prove that the angles `BAC`, `ACB` are also less than two right angles, and so are the angles `CAB`, `ABC` as well.

Therefore etc.
