   To bisect a given finite straight line.

Let ``AB`` be the given finite straight line.

Thus it is required to bisect the finite straight line ``AB``.

Let the equilateral triangle ``ABC`` be constructed on it, [:ref:`I.1 <I.1>`] and let the angle ``ACB`` be bisected by the straight line ``CD``; [:ref:`I.9 <I.9>`]

I say that the straight line ``AB`` has been bisected at the point ``D``.

For, since ``AC`` is equal to ``CB``, and ``CD`` is common, 
        the two sides ``AC``, ``CD`` are equal to the two sides ``BC``, ``CD`` respectively; and the angle ``ACD`` is equal to the angle ``BCD``; therefore the base ``AD`` is equal to the base ``BD``. [:ref:`I.4 <I.4>`]

Therefore the given finite straight line ``AB`` has been bisected at ``D``.
