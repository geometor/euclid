   Given two unequal straight lines, to cut off from the greater a straight line equal to the less.

Let ``AB``, ``C`` be the-two given unequal straight lines, and let ``AB`` be the greater of them.

Thus it is required to cut off from ``AB`` the greater a straight line equal to ``C`` the less.

At the point ``A`` let ``AD`` be placed equal to the straight line ``C``; [:ref:`I.2 <I.2>`] and with centre ``A`` and distance ``AD`` let the circle ``DEF`` be described. [:ref:`I.post.3 <I.post.3>`] Now, since the point ``A`` is the centre of the circle ``DEF``, ``AE`` is equal to ``AD``. [:ref:`I.def.15 <I.def.15>`] But ``C`` is also equal to ``AD``. Therefore each of the straight lines ``AE``, ``C`` is equal to ``AD``; so that ``AE`` is also equal to ``C``. [:ref:`I.cn.1 <I.cn.1>`]

Therefore, given the two straight lines ``AB``, ``C``, from ``AB`` the greater ``AE`` has been cut off equal to ``C`` the less.
