   Through a given point to draw a straight line parallel to a given straight line.

Let ``A`` be the given point, and ``BC`` the given straight line; thus it is required to draw through the point ``A`` a straight line parallel to the straight line ``BC``. 

Let a point ``D`` be taken at random on ``BC``, and let ``AD`` be joined; on the straight line ``DA``, and at the point ``A`` on it, let the angle ``DAE`` be constructed equal to the angle ``ADC`` [:ref:`I.23 <I.23>`]; and let the straight line ``AF`` be produced in a straight line with ``EA``. 

Then, since the straight line ``AD`` falling on the two straight lines ``BC``, ``EF`` has made the alternate angles ``EAD``, ``ADC`` equal to one another, therefore ``EAF`` is parallel to ``BC``. [:ref:`I.27 <I.27>`]

Therefore through the given point ``A`` the straight line ``EAF`` has been drawn parallel to the given straight line ``BC``.
