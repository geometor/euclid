   Parallelograms which are on equal bases and in the same parallels are equal to one another.

Let ``ABCD``, ``EFGH`` be parallelograms which are on equal bases ``BC``, ``FG`` and in the same parallels ``AH``, ``BG``;  I say that the parallelogram ``ABCD`` is equal to ``EFGH``.

For let ``BE``, ``CH`` be joined.

Then, since ``BC`` is equal to ``FG`` while ``FG`` is equal to ``EH``, ``BC`` is also equal to ``EH``. [:ref:`I.cn.1 <I.cn.1>`]

But they are also parallel.

And ``EB``, ``HC`` join them; but straight lines joining equal and parallel straight lines (at the extremities which are) in the same directions (respectively) are equal and parallel. [:ref:`I.33 <I.33>`]

Therefore ``EBCH`` is a parallelogram. [:ref:`I.34 <I.34>`]

And it is equal to ``ABCD``; for it has the same base ``BC`` with it, and is in the same parallels ``BC``, ``AH`` with it. [:ref:`I.35 <I.35>`]

For the same reason also ``EFGH`` is equal to the same ``EBCH``; [:ref:`I.35 <I.35>`] so that the parallelogram ``ABCD`` is also equal to ``EFGH``. [:ref:`I.cn.1 <I.cn.1>`]

Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
