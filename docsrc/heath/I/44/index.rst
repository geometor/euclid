   To a given straight line to apply, in a given rectilineal angle, a parallelogram equal to a given triangle.

Let ``AB`` be the given straight line, ``C`` the given triangle and ``D`` the given rectilineal angle; thus it is required to apply to the given straight line ``AB``, in an angle equal to the angle ``D``, a parallelogram equal to the given triangle ``C``.

Let the parallelogram ``BEFG`` be constructed equal to the triangle ``C``, in the angle ``EBG`` which is equal to ``D`` [:ref:`I.42 <I.42>`]; let it be placed so that ``BE`` is in a straight line with ``AB``; let``FG`` be drawn through to ``H``, and let ``AH`` be drawn through ``A`` parallel to either ``BG`` or ``EF``. [:ref:`I.31 <I.31>`]

Let ``HB`` be joined. 

Then, since the straight line ``HF`` falls upon the parallels ``AH``, ``EF``, the angles ``AHF``, ``HFE`` are equal to two right angles. [:ref:`I.29 <I.29>`] Therefore the angles ``BHG``, ``GFE`` are less than two right angles; and straight lines produced indefinitely from angles less than two right angles meet; [:ref:`I.post.5 <I.post.5>`] therefore ``HB``, ``FE``, when produced, will meet.

Let them be produced and meet at ``K``; through the point ``K`` let ``KL`` be drawn parallel to either ``EA`` or ``FH``, [:ref:`I.31 <I.31>`] and let ``HA``, ``GB`` be produced to the points ``L``, ``M``. 

Then ``HLKF`` is a parallelogram, ``HK`` is its diameter, and ``AG``, ``ME`` are parallelograms. and ``LB``, ``BF`` the so-called complements, about ``HK``; therefore ``LB`` is equal to ``BF``. [:ref:`I.43 <I.43>`]

But ``BF`` is equal to the triangle ``C``; therefore ``LB`` is also equal to ``C``. [:ref:`I.cn.1 <I.cn.1>`]

And, since the angle ``GBE`` is equal to the angle ``ABM``, [:ref:`I.15 <I.15>`] while the angle ``GBE`` is equal to ``D``, the angle ``ABM`` is also equal to the angle ``D``.

Therefore the parallelogram ``LB`` equal to the given triangle ``C`` has been applied to the given straight line ``AB``, in the angle ``ABM`` which is equal to ``D``.
