===

   If in a triangle two angles be equal to one another, the sides which subtend the equal angles will also be equal to one another.

Let ``ABC`` be a triangle having the angle ``ABC`` equal to the angle ``ACB``;

I say that the side ``AB`` is also equal to the side ``AC``.

For, if ``AB`` is unequal to ``AC``, one of them is greater.

Let ``AB`` be greater; and from ``AB`` the greater let ``DB`` be cut off equal to ``AC`` the less;

let ``DC`` be joined. 

Then, since ``DB`` is equal to ``AC``, and ``BC`` is common, the two sides ``DB``, ``BC`` are equal to the two sides ``AC``, ``CB`` respectively;
        and the angle ``DBC`` is equal to the angle ``ACB``; therefore the base ``DC`` is equal to the base ``AB``, and the triangle ``DBC`` will be equal to the triangle ``ACB``, the less to the greater: which is absurd. Therefore ``AB`` is not unequal to ``AC``; it is therefore equal to it.

Therefore etc.
