III.11
======

   If two circles touch one another internally, and their centres be taken, the straight line joining their centres, if it be also produced, will fall on the point of contact of the circles.

For let the two circles ``ABC``, ``ADE`` touch one another internally at the point ``A``, and let the centre ``F`` of the circle ``ABC``, and the centre ``G`` of ``ADE``, be taken; I say that the straight line joined from ``G`` to ``F`` and produced will fall on ``A``.

For suppose it does not, but, if possible, let it fall as ``FGH``, and let ``AF``, ``AG`` be joined.

Then, since ``AG``, ``GF`` are greater than ``FA``, that is, than ``FH``,

let ``FG`` be subtracted from each; therefore the remainder ``AG`` is greater than the remainder ``GH``.

But ``AG`` is equal to ``GD``;


.. container:: center

   therefore ``GD`` is also greater than ``GH``, the less than the greater: which is impossible.


Therefore the straight line joined from ``F`` to ``G`` will not fall outside;


.. container:: center

   therefore it will fall at ``A`` on the point of contact.


Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
the straight line joining their centres, literally the straight line joined to their centres
(ἡ ἐπὶ τὰ κέντρα αὐτῶν ἐπιζευγνυμένη εὐθεῖα).
point of contact is here συναφἡ, and in the enunciation of the next proposition ἐπαφἡ.
