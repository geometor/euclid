III.12
======

   If two circles touch one another externally, the straight line joining their centres will pass through the point of contact.

For let the two circles ``ABC``, ``ADE`` touch one another externally at the point ``A``, and let the centre ``F`` of ``ABC``, and the centre ``G`` of ``ADE``, be taken; I say that the straight line joined from ``F`` to ``G`` will pass through the point of contact at ``A``.

For suppose it does not, but, if possible, let it pass as ``FCDG``, and let ``AF``, ``AG`` be joined.

Then, since the point ``F`` is the centre of the circle ``ABC``,


.. container:: center

   ``FA`` is equal to ``FC``.


Again, since the point ``G`` is the centre of the circle ``ADE``,


.. container:: center

   ``GA`` is equal to ``GD``.


But ``FA`` was also proved equal to ``FC``;


.. container:: center

   therefore ``FA``, ``AG`` are equal to ``FC``, ``GD``, so that the whole ``FG`` is greater than ``FA``, ``AG``;


but it is also less [:ref:`I.20 <I.20>`]: which is impossible.

Therefore the straight line joined from ``F`` to ``G`` will not fail to pass through the point of contact at ``A``;


.. container:: center

   therefore it will pass through it.


Therefore etc. Q. E. D.]
will not fail to pass. The Greek has the double negative, οὐκ ἄρα ἡ...εὐθεῖα... οὐκ ἐλεύσεται, literally the straight line...will not ``not``-pass....
