III.14
======

   In a circle equal straight lines are equally distant from the centre, and those which are equally distant from the centre are equal to one another.

Let ``ABDC`` be a circle, and let ``AB``, ``CD`` be equal straight lines in it; I say that ``AB``, ``CD`` are equally distant from the centre.

For let the centre of the circle ``ABDC`` be taken [:ref:`III.1 <III.1>`], and let it be ``E``; from ``E`` let ``EF``, ``EG`` be drawn perpendicular to ``AB``, ``CD``, and let ``AE``, ``EC`` be joined.

Then, since a straight line ``EF`` through the centre cuts a straight line ``AB`` not through the centre at right angles, it also bisects it. [:ref:`III.3 <III.3>`]


.. container:: center

   Therefore ``AF`` is equal to ``FB``; therefore ``AB`` is double of ``AF``.


For the same reason


.. container:: center

   ``CD`` is also double of ``CG``;


and ``AB`` is equal to ``CD``;


.. container:: center

   therefore ``AF`` is also equal to ``CG``.


And, since ``AE`` is equal to ``EC``,


.. container:: center

   the square on ``AE`` is also equal to the square on ``EC``.


But the squares on ``AF``, ``EF`` are equal to the square on ``AE``, for the angle at ``F`` is right; and the squares on ``EG``, ``GC`` are equal to the square on ``EC``, for the angle at ``G`` is right; [:ref:`I.47 <I.47>`]


.. container:: center

   therefore the squares on ``AF``, ``FE`` are equal to the squares on ``CG``, ``GE``,


of which the square on ``AF`` is equal to the square on ``CG``, for ``AF`` is equal to ``CG``;


.. container:: center

   therefore the square on ``FE`` which remains is equal to the square on ``EG``, therefore ``EF`` is equal to ``EG``.


But in a circle straight lines are said to be equally distant from the centre when the perpendiculars drawn to them from the centre are equal; [:ref:`III.def.4 <III.def.4>`]


.. container:: center

   therefore ``AB``, ``CD`` are equally distant from the centre.


Next, let the straight lines ``AB``, ``CD`` be equally distant from the centre; that is, let ``EF`` be equal to ``EG``.

I say that ``AB`` is also equal to ``CD``.

For, with the same construction, we can prove, similarly, that ``AB`` is double of ``AF``, and ``CD`` of ``CG``.

And, since ``AE`` is equal to ``CE``,


.. container:: center

   the square on ``AE`` is equal to the square on ``CE``.


But the squares on ``EF``, ``FA`` are equal to the square on ``AE``, and the squares on ``EG``, ``GC`` equal to the square on ``CE``. [:ref:`I.47 <I.47>`]

Therefore the squares on ``EF``, ``FA`` are equal to the squares on ``EG``, ``GC``, of which the square on ``EF`` is equal to the square on ``EG``, for ``EF`` is equal to ``EG``; therefore the square on ``AF`` which remains is equal to the square on ``CG``;


.. container:: center

   therefore ``AF`` is equal to ``CG``.


And ``AB`` is double of ``AF``, and ``CD`` double of ``CG``;


.. container:: center

   therefore ``AB`` is equal to ``CD``.


Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
