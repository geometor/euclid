III.15
======

   Of straight lines in a circle the diameter is greatest, and of the rest the nearer to the centre is always greater than the more remote.

Let ``ABCD`` be a circle, let ``AD`` be its diameter and ``E`` the centre; and let ``BC`` be nearer to the diameter ``AD``, and ``FG`` more remote; I say that ``AD`` is greatest and ``BC`` greater than ``FG``.

For from the centre ``E`` let ``EH``, ``EK``

be drawn perpendicular to ``BC``, ``FG``.

Then, since ``BC`` is nearer to the centre and ``FG`` more remote, ``EK`` is greater than ``EH``. [:ref:`III.def.5 <III.def.5>`]

Let ``EL`` be made equal to ``EH``, through ``L`` let ``LM`` be drawn at right angles to ``EK`` and carried through to ``N``, and let ``ME``, ``EN``, ``FE``, ``EG`` be joined.

Then, since ``EH`` is equal to ``EL``,


.. container:: center

   ``BC`` is also equal to ``MN``. [:ref:`III.14 <III.14>`]


Again, since ``AE`` is equal to ``EM``, and ``ED`` to ``EN``,


.. container:: center

   ``AD`` is equal to ``ME``, ``EN``.


But ``ME``, ``EN`` are greater than ``MN``, [:ref:`I.20 <I.20>`] and ``MN`` is equal to ``BC``;


.. container:: center

   therefore ``AD`` is greater than ``BC``.


And, since the two sides ``ME``, ``EN`` are equal to the two sides ``FE``, ``EG``, and the angle ``MEN`` greater than the angle ``FEG``, therefore the base ``MN`` is greater than the base ``FG``. [:ref:`I.24 <I.24>`]

But ``MN`` was proved equal to ``BC``.

Therefore the diameter ``AD`` is greatest and ``BC`` greater than ``FG``.

Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
Of straight lines. The Greek leaves these words to be understood.
Nearer to the diameter AD. As ``BC``, ``FG`` are not in general parallel to ``AD``, Euclid should have said nearer to the centre.
