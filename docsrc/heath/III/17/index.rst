III.17

   From a given point to draw a straight line touching a given circle.

Let ``A`` be the given point, and ``BCD`` the given circle; thus it is required to draw from the point ``A`` a straight line touching the circle ``BCD``.

For let the centre ``E`` of the circle be taken; [:ref:`III.1 <III.1>`] let ``AE`` be joined, and with centre ``E`` and distance ``EA`` let the circle ``AFG`` be described;

from ``D`` let ``DF`` be drawn at right angles to ``EA``, and let ``EF``, ``AB`` be joined; I say that ``AB`` has been drawn from the point ``A`` touching the circle ``BCD``.

For, since ``E`` is the centre of the circles ``BCD``, ``AFG``,


.. container:: center

   ``EA`` is equal to ``EF``, and ``ED`` to ``EB``;


therefore the two sides ``AE``, ``EB`` are equal to the two sides ``FE``, ``ED``: and they contain a common angle, the angle at ``E``;


.. container:: center

   therefore the base ``DF`` is equal to the base ``AB``, and the triangle ``DEF`` is equal to the triangle ``BEA``, and the remaining angles to the remaining angles; [:ref:`I.4 <I.4>`] therefore the angle ``EDF`` is equal to the angle ``EBA``.


But the angle ``EDF`` is right;


.. container:: center

   therefore the angle ``EBA`` is also right.


Now ``EB`` is a radius; and the straight line drawn at right angles to the diameter of a circle, from its extremity, touches the circle; [:ref:`III.16.p.1 <III.16.p.1>`]


.. container:: center

   therefore ``AB`` touches the circle ``BCD``.


Therefore from the given point ``A`` the straight line ``AB`` has been drawn touching the circle ``BCD``.
