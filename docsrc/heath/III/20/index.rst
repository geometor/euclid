III.20
======

   In a circle the angle at the centre is double of the angle at the circumference, when the angles have the same circumference as base.

Let ``ABC`` be a circle, let the angle ``BEC`` be an angle at its centre, and the angle ``BAC`` an angle at the circumference, and let them have the same circumference ``BC`` as base; I say that the angle ``BEC`` is double of the angle ``BAC``.

For let ``AE`` be joined and drawn through to ``F``.

Then, since ``EA`` is equal to ``EB``,


.. container:: center

   the angle ``EAB`` is also equal to the angle ``EBA``; [:ref:`I.5 <I.5>`]


therefore the angles ``EAB``, ``EBA`` are double of the angle ``EAB``.

But the angle ``BEF`` is equal to the angles ``EAB``, ``EBA``; [:ref:`I.32 <I.32>`] therefore the angle ``BEF`` is also double of the angle ``EAB``.

For the same reason


.. container:: center

   the angle ``FEC`` is also double of the angle ``EAC``.


Therefore the whole angle ``BEC`` is double of the whole angle ``BAC``.

Again let another straight line be inflected, and let there be another angle ``BDC``; let ``DE`` be joined and produced to ``G``.

Similarly then we can prove that the angle ``GEC`` is double of the angle ``EDC``,


.. container:: center

   of which the angle ``GEB`` is double of the angle ``EDB``; therefore the angle ``BEC`` which remains is double of the angle ``BDC``.


Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
let another straight line be inflected, κεκλάσθω δὴ πάλιν (without εὐθεῖα). The verb κλάω (to ``break off``) was the regular technical term for drawing from a point a (broken) straight line which first meets another straight line or curve and is then ``bent back`` from it to another point, or (in other words) for drawing straight lines from two points meeting at a point on a curve or another straight line. κεκλάσθαι is one of the geometrical terms the definition of which must according to Aristotle be assumed (Anal. Post. I. 10, 76 b 9).
