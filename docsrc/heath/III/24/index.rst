III.24
======

   Similar segments of circles on equal straight lines are equal to one another.

For let ``AEB``, ``CFD`` be similar segments of circles on equal straight lines ``AB``, ``CD``; I say that the segment ``AEB`` is equal to the segment ``CFD``.

For, if the segment ``AEB`` be applied to ``CFD``, and if the point ``A`` be placed on ``C`` and the straight line ``AB`` on ``CD``,


.. container:: center

   the point ``B`` will also coincide with the point ``D``, because ``AB`` is equal to ``CD``;



.. container:: center

   and, ``AB`` coinciding with ``CD``, the segment ``AEB`` will also coincide with ``CFD``.


For, if the straight line ``AB`` coincide with ``CD`` but the segment ``AEB`` do not coincide with ``CFD``, it will either fall with it, or outside it; or it will fall awry, as ``CGD``, and a circle cuts a circle at more points than two : which is impossible. [:ref:`III.10 <III.10>`]

Therefore, if the straight line ``AB`` be applied to ``CD``, the segment ``AEB`` will not fail to coincide with ``CFD`` also;


.. container:: center

   therefore it will coincide with it and will be equal to it.


Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
fall awry, παραλλάξει, the same word as used in the like case in :ref:`I.8 <I.8>`. The word implies that the applied figure will partly fall short of, and partly overlap, the figure to which it is applied.
