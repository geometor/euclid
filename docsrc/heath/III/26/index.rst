III.26
======

   In equal circles equal angles stand on equal circumferences, whether they stand at the centres or at the circumferences.

Let ``ABC``, ``DEF`` be equal circles, and in them let there be equal angles, namely at the centres the angles ``BGC``, ``EHF``, and at the circumferences the angles ``BAC``, ``EDF``; I say that the circumference ``BKC`` is equal to the circumference ``ELF``.

For let ``BC``, ``EF`` be joined.

Now, since the circles ``ABC``, ``DEF`` are equal,


.. container:: center

   the radii are equal.


Thus the two straight lines ``BG``, ``GC`` are equal to the two straight lines ``EH``, ``HF``;


.. container:: center

   and the angle at ``G`` is equal to the angle at ``H``; therefore the base ``BC`` is equal to the base ``EF``. [:ref:`I.4 <I.4>`]


And, since the angle at ``A`` is equal to the angle at ``D``,


.. container:: center

   the segment ``BAC`` is similar to the segment ``EDF``; [:ref:`III.def.11 <III.def.11>`]


and they are upon equal straight lines.

But similar segments of circles on equal straight lines are equal to one another; [:ref:`III.24 <III.24>`]


.. container:: center

   therefore the segment ``BAC`` is equal to ``EDF``.


But the whole circle ``ABC`` is also equal to the whole circle ``DEF``; therefore the circumference ``BKC`` which remains is equal to the circumference ``ELF``.

Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
