   In equal circles angles standing on equal circumferences are equal to one another, whether they stand at the centres or at the circumferences.

For in equal circles ``ABC``, ``DEF``, on equal circumferences ``BC``, ``EF``, let the angles ``BGC``, ``EHF`` stand at the centres ``G``, ``H``, and the angles ``BAC``, ``EDF`` at the circumferences; I say that the angle ``BGC`` is equal to the angle ``EHF``, and the angle ``BAC`` is equal to the angle ``EDF``.

For, if the angle ``BGC`` is unequal to the angle ``EHF``,


.. container:: center

   one of them is greater.


Let the angle ``BGC`` be greater : and on the straight line ``BG``, and at the point ``G`` on it, let the angle ``BGK`` be constructed equal to the angle ``EHF``. [:ref:`I.23 <I.23>`]

Now equal angles stand on equal circumferences, when they are at the centres; [:ref:`III.26 <III.26>`]


.. container:: center

   therefore the circumference ``BK`` is equal to the circumference ``EF``.


But ``EF`` is equal to ``BC``;


.. container:: center

   therefore ``BK`` is also equal to ``BC``, the less to the greater : which is impossible.


Therefore the angle ``BGC`` is not unequal to the angle ``EHF``;


.. container:: center

   therefore it is equal to it.


And the angle at ``A`` is half of the angle ``BGC``,


.. container:: center

   and the angle at ``D`` half of the angle ``EHF``; [:ref:`III.20 <III.20>`]


therefore the angle at ``A`` is also equal to the angle at ``D``.

Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
