III.3
=====

   If in a circle a straight line through the centre bisect a straight line not through the centre, it also cuts it at right angles; and if it cut it at right angles, it also bisects it.

Let ``ABC`` be a circle, and in it let a straight line ``CD``
through the centre bisect a straight line ``AB`` not through the centre at the point ``F``;

I say that it also cuts it at right angles.

For let the centre of the circle ``ABC``
be taken, and let it be ``E``; let ``EA``, ``EB`` be joined.

Then, since ``AF`` is equal to ``FB``, and ``FE`` is common,


.. container:: center

   two sides are equal to two sides;



.. container:: center

   and the base ``EA`` is equal to the base ``EB``; therefore the angle ``AFE`` is equal to the angle ``BFE``. [:ref:`I.8 <I.8>`]


But, when a straight line set up on a straight line makes the adjacent angles equal to one another, each of the equal angles is right; [:ref:`I.def.10 <I.def.10>`]


.. container:: center

   therefore each of the angles ``AFE``, ``BFE`` is right.


Therefore ``CD``, which is through the centre, and bisects ``AB`` which is not through the centre, also cuts it at right angles.

Again, let ``CD`` cut ``AB`` at right angles; I say that it also bisects it. that is, that ``AF`` is equal to ``FB``.

For, with the same construction,


.. container:: center

   since ``EA`` is equal to ``EB``,


the angle ``EAF`` is also equal to the angle ``EBF``. [:ref:`I.5 <I.5>`]

But the right angle ``AFE`` is equal to the right angle ``BFE``, therefore ``EAF``, ``EBF`` are two triangles having two angles equal to two angles and one side equal to one side, namely ``EF``, which is common to them, and subtends one of the equal angles;


.. container:: center

   therefore they will also have the remaining sides equal to the remaining sides; [:ref:`I.26 <I.26>`] therefore ``AF`` is equal to ``FB``.


Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
