   From a given circle to cut off a segment admitting an angle equal to a given rectilineal angle.

Let ``ABC`` be the given circle, and the angle at ``D`` the given rectilineal angle; thus it is required to cut off from the circle ``ABC`` a segment admitting an angle equal to the given rectilineal angle, the angle at ``D``.

Let ``EF`` be drawn touching ``ABC`` at the point ``B``, and on the straight line ``FB``, and at the point ``B`` on it, let the angle ``FBC`` be constructed equal to the angle at ``D``. [:ref:`I.23 <I.23>`]

Then, since a straight line ``EF`` touches the circle ``ABC``,


.. container:: center

   and ``BC`` has been drawn across from the point of contact at ``B``,


the angle ``FBC`` is equal to the angle constructed in the alternate segment ``BAC``. [:ref:`III.32 <III.32>`]

But the angle ``FBC`` is equal to the angle at ``D``;


.. container:: center

   therefore the angle in the segment ``BAC`` is equal to the angle at ``D``.


Therefore from the given circle ``ABC`` the segment ``BAC``. has been cut off admitting an angle equal to the given rectilineal angle, the angle at ``D``. Q. E. F.
