III.5
=====

   If two circles cut one another, they will not have the same centre.

For let the circles ``ABC``, ``CDG`` cut one another at the points ``B``, ``C``; I say that they will not have the same centre.

For, if possible, let it be ``E``; let ``EC`` be joined, and let ``EFG`` be drawn through at random.

Then, since the point ``E`` is the centre of the circle ``ABC``,


.. container:: center

   ``EC`` is equal to ``EF``. [:ref:`I.def.15 <I.def.15>`]


Again, since the point ``E`` is the centre of the circle ``CDG``,


.. container:: center

   ``EC`` is equal to ``EG``.


But ``EC`` was proved equal to ``EF`` also;


.. container:: center

   therefore ``EF`` is also equal to ``EG``, the less to the greater : which is impossible.


Therefore the point ``E`` is not the centre of the circles ``ABC``, ``CDG``.

Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
