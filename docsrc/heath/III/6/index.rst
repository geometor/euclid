III.6
=====

   If two circles touch one another, they will not have the same centre.

``If two circles touch one another``, ``they will not have the same centre``.

For let the two circles ``ABC``, ``CDE`` touch one another at the point ``C``; I say that they will not have the same centre.

For, if possible, let it be ``F``; let ``FC`` be joined, and let ``FEB`` be drawn through at random.

Then, since the point ``F`` is the centre of the circle ``ABC``,


.. container:: center

   ``FC`` is equal to ``FB``.


Again, since the point ``F`` is the centre of the circle ``CDE``,


.. container:: center

   ``FC`` is equal to ``FE``.


But ``FC`` was proved equal to ``FB``;


.. container:: center

   therefore ``FE`` is also equal to ``FB``, the less to the greater: which is impossible.


Therefore ``F`` is not the centre of the circles ``ABC``, ``CDE``.

Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
