III.9
=====

   If a point be taken within a circle, and more than two equal straight lines fall from the point on the circle, the point taken is the centre of the circle.

Let ``ABC`` be a circle and ``D`` a point within it, and from ``D`` let more than two equal straight lines, namely ``DA``, ``DB``, ``DC``, fall on the circle ``ABC``; I say that the point ``D`` is the centre of the circle ``ABC``.

For let ``AB``, ``BC`` be joined and bisected at the points ``E``, ``F``, and let ``ED``, ``FD`` be joined and drawn through to the points ``G``, ``K``, ``H``, ``L``.

Then, since ``AE`` is equal to ``EB``, and ``ED`` is common,


.. container:: center

   the two sides ``AE``, ``ED`` are equal to the two sides ``BE``, ``ED``;


and the base ``DA`` is equal to the base ``DB``;


.. container:: center

   therefore the angle ``AED`` is equal to the angle ``BED``. [:ref:`I.8 <I.8>`]


Therefore each of the angles ``AED``, ``BED`` is right; [:ref:`I.def.10 <I.def.10>`] therefore ``GK`` cuts ``AB`` into two equal parts and at right angles.

And since, if in a circle a straight line cut a straight line into two equal parts and at right angles, the centre of the circle is on the cutting straight line, [:ref:`III.1.p.1 <III.1.p.1>`]


.. container:: center

   the centre of the circle is on ``GK``.


For the same reason


.. container:: center

   the centre of the circle ``ABC`` is also on ``HL``.


And the straight lines ``GK``, ``HL`` have no other point common but the point ``D``;


.. container:: center

   therefore the point ``D`` is the centre of the circle ``ABC``.


Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
