   Into a given circle to fit a straight line equal to a given straight line which is not greater than the diameter of the circle.

Let ``ABC`` be the given circle, and ``D`` the given straight line not greater than the diameter of the circle; thus it is required to fit into the circle ``ABC`` a straight line equal to the straight line ``D``.

Let a diameter ``BC`` of the circle ``ABC`` be drawn.

Then, if ``BC`` is equal to ``D``, that which was enjoined will have been done; for ``BC`` has been fitted into the circle ``ABC`` equal to the straight line ``D``.

But, if ``BC`` is greater than ``D``, let ``CE`` be made equal to ``D``, and with centre ``C`` and distance ``CE`` let the circle ``EAF`` be described; let ``CA`` be joined.

Then, since the point ``C`` is the centre of the circle ``EAF``,


.. container:: center

   ``CA`` is equal to ``CE``.


But ``CE`` is equal to ``D``;


.. container:: center

   therefore ``D`` is also equal to ``CA``.


Therefore into the given circle ``ABC`` there has been fitted ``CA`` equal to the given straight line ``D``.
