   In a given circle to inscribe an equilateral and equiangular pentagon.

Let ``ABCDE`` be the given circle; thus it is required to inscribe in the circle ``ABCDE`` an equilateral and equiangular pentagon.

Let the isosceles triangle ``FGH`` be set out having each of the angles at ``G``, ``H`` double of the angle at ``F``; [:ref:`IV.10 <IV.10>`]

let there be inscribed in the circle ``ABCDE`` the triangle ``ACD`` equiangular with the triangle ``FGH``, so that the angle ``CAD`` is equal to the angle at ``F`` and the angles at ``G``, ``H`` respectively equal to the angles ``ACD``, ``CDA``; [:ref:`IV.2 <IV.2>`] therefore each of the angles ``ACD``, ``CDA`` is also double of the angle ``CAD``.

Now let the angles ``ACD``, ``CDA`` be bisected respectively by the straight lines ``CE``, ``DB`` [:ref:`I.9 <I.9>`], and let ``AB``, ``BC``, ``DE``, ``EA`` be joined.

Then, since each of the angles ``ACD``, ``CDA`` is double of the angle ``CAD``, and they have been bisected by the straight lines ``CE``, ``DB``, therefore the five angles ``DAC``, ``ACE``, ``ECD``, ``CDB``, ``BDA`` are equal to one another.

But equal angles stand on equal circumferences; [:ref:`III.26 <III.26>`] therefore the five circumferences ``AB``, ``BC``, ``CD``, ``DE``, ``EA`` are equal to one another.

But equal circumferences are subtended by equal straight lines; [:ref:`III.29 <III.29>`] therefore the five straight lines ``AB``, ``BC``, ``CD``, ``DE``, ``EA`` are equal to one another;


.. container:: center

   therefore the pentagon ``ABCDE`` is equilateral.


I say next that it is also equiangular.

For, since the circumference ``AB`` is equal to the circumference ``DE``, let ``BCD`` be added to each;


.. container:: center

   therefore the whole circumference ``ABCD`` is equal to the whole circumference ``EDCB``.


And the angle ``AED`` stands on the circumference ``ABCD``, and the angle ``BAE`` on the circumference ``EDCB``;


.. container:: center

   therefore the angle ``BAE`` is also equal to the angle ``AED``. [:ref:`III.27 <III.27>`]


For the same reason each of the angles ``ABC``, ``BCD``, ``CDE`` is also equal to each of the angles ``BAE``, ``AED``;


.. container:: center

   therefore the pentagon ``ABCDE`` is equiangular.


But it was also proved equilateral;


.. container:: center

   therefore in the given circle an equilateral and equiangular pentagon has been inscribed. Q. E. F.
