   About a given circle to circumscribe an equilateral and equiangular pentagon.

Let ``ABCDE`` be the given circle; thus it is required to circumscribe an equilateral and equiangular pentagon about the circle ``ABCDE``.

Let ``A``, ``B``, ``C``, ``D``, ``E`` be conceived to be the angular points of the inscribed pentagon, so that the circumferences ``AB``, ``BC``, ``CD``, ``DE``, ``EA`` are equal; [:ref:`IV.11 <IV.11>`]

through ``A``, ``B``, ``C``, ``D``, ``E`` let ``GH``, ``HK``, ``KL``, ``LM``, ``MG`` be drawn touching the circle; [:ref:`III.16.p.1 <III.16.p.1>`] let the centre ``F`` of the circle ``ABCDE`` be taken [:ref:`III.1 <III.1>`], and let ``FB``, ``FK``, ``FC``, ``FL``, ``FD`` be joined.

Then, since the straight line ``KL`` touches the circle ``ABCDE`` at ``C``, and ``FC`` has been joined from the centre ``F`` to the point of contact at ``C``,


.. container:: center

   therefore ``FC`` is perpendicular to ``KL``; [:ref:`III.18 <III.18>`] therefore each of the angles at ``C`` is right.


For the same reason


.. container:: center

   the angles at the points ``B``, ``D`` are also right.


And, since the angle ``FCK`` is right, therefore the square on ``FK`` is equal to the squares on ``FC``, ``CK``.

For the same reason [:ref:`I.47 <I.47>`]


.. container:: center

   the square on ``FK`` is also equal to the squares on ``FB``, ``BK``; so that the squares on ``FC``, ``CK`` are equal to the squares on ``FB``, ``BK``, of which the square on ``FC`` is equal to the square on ``FB``;


therefore the square on ``CK`` which remains is equal to the square on ``BK``.

Therefore ``BK`` is equal to ``CK``.

And, since ``FB`` is equal to ``FC``, and ``FK`` common,


.. container:: center

   the two sides ``BF``, ``FK`` are equal to the two sides ``CF``, ``FK``; and the base ``BK`` equal to the base ``CK``; therefore the angle ``BFK`` is equal to the angle ``KFC``, [:ref:`I.8 <I.8>`] and the angle ``BKF`` to the angle ``FKC``.


Therefore the angle ``BFC`` is double of the angle ``KFC``,


.. container:: center

   and the angle ``BKC`` of the angle ``FKC``.


For the same reason


.. container:: center

   the angle ``CFD`` is also double of the angle ``CFL``, and the angle ``DLC`` of the angle ``FLC``.


Now, since the circumference ``BC`` is equal to ``CD``, the angle ``BFC`` is also equal to the angle ``CFD``. [:ref:`III.27 <III.27>`]

And the angle ``BFC`` is double of the angle ``KFC``, and the angle ``DFC`` of the angle ``LFC``;


.. container:: center

   therefore the angle ``KFC`` is also equal to the angle ``LFC``.


But the angle ``FCK`` is also equal to the angle ``FCL``; therefore ``FKC``, ``FLC`` are two triangles having two angles equal to two angles and one side equal to one side, namely ``FC`` which is common to them; therefore they will also have the remaining sides equal to the remaining sides, and the remaining angle to the remaining angle; [:ref:`I.26 <I.26>`]


.. container:: center

   therefore the straight line ``KC`` is equal to ``CL``, and the angle ``FKC`` to the angle ``FLC``.


And, since ``KC`` is equal to ``CL``, therefore ``KL`` is double of ``KC``.

For the same reason it can be proved that


.. container:: center

   ``HK`` is also double of ``BK``.


And ``BK`` is equal to ``KC``;


.. container:: center

   therefore ``HK`` is also equal to ``KL``.


Similarly each of the straight lines ``HG``, ``GM``, ``ML`` can also be proved equal to each of the straight lines ``HK``, ``KL``;


.. container:: center

   therefore the pentagon ``GHKLM`` is equilateral.


I say next that it is also equiangular.

For, since the angle ``FKC`` is equal to the angle ``FLC``, and the angle ``HKL`` was proved double of the angle ``FKC``,


.. container:: center

   and the angle ``KLM`` double of the angle ``FLC``, therefore the angle ``HKL`` is also equal to the angle ``KLM``.


Similarly each of the angles ``KHG``, ``HGM``, ``GML`` can also be proved equal to each of the angles ``HKL``, ``KLM``; therefore the five angles ``GHK``, ``HKL``, ``KLM``, ``LMG``, ``MGH`` are equal to one another.

Therefore the pentagon ``GHKLM`` is equiangular.

And it was also proved equilateral; and it has been circumscribed about the circle ``ABCDE``. Q. E. F.
