IV.2
====

   In a given circle to inscribe a triangle equiangular with a given triangle.

Let ``ABC`` be the given circle, and ``DEF`` the given triangle; thus it is required to inscribe in the circle ``ABC`` a triangle equiangular with the triangle ``DEF``.

Let ``GH`` be drawn touching the circle ``ABC`` at ``A`` [:ref:`III.16.p.1 <III.16.p.1>`]; on the straight line ``AH``, and at the point ``A`` on it, let the angle ``HAC`` be constructed equal to the angle ``DEF``, and on the straight line ``AG``, and at the point ``A`` on it, let the angle ``GAB`` be constructed equal to the angle ``DFE``; [:ref:`I.23 <I.23>`] let ``BC`` be joined.

Then, since a straight line ``AH`` touches the circle ``ABC``, and from the point of contact at ``A`` the straight line ``AC`` is drawn across in the circle, therefore the angle ``HAC`` is equal to the angle ``ABC`` in the alternate segment of the circle. [:ref:`III.32 <III.32>`]

But the angle ``HAC`` is equal to the angle ``DEF``; therefore the angle ``ABC`` is also equal to the angle ``DEF``.

For the same reason


.. container:: center

   the angle ``ACB`` is also equal to the angle ``DFE``;


therefore the remaining angle ``BAC`` is also equal to the remaining angle ``EDF``. [:ref:`I.32 <I.32>`]

Therefore in the given circle there has been inscribed a triangle equiangular with the given triangle. Q. E. F.
