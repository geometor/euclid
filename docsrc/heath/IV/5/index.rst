   About a given triangle to circumscribe a circle.

Let ``ABC`` be the given triangle; thus it is required to circumscribe a circle about the given triangle ``ABC``.

Let the straight lines ``AB``, ``AC`` be bisected at the points ``D``, ``E`` [:ref:`I.10 <I.10>`], and from the points ``D``, ``E`` let ``DF``, ``EF`` be drawn at right angles to ``AB``, ``AC``; they will then meet within the triangle ``ABC``, or on the straight line ``BC``, or outside ``BC``.

First let them meet within at ``F``, and let ``FB``, ``FC``, ``FA`` be joined.

Then, since ``AD`` is equal to ``DB``, and ``DF`` is common and at right angles, therefore the base ``AF`` is equal to the base ``FB``. [:ref:`I.4 <I.4>`]

Similarly we can prove that


.. container:: center

   ``CF`` is also equal to ``AF``;


so that ``FB`` is also equal to ``FC``;


.. container:: center

   therefore the three straight lines ``FA``, ``FB``, ``FC`` are equal to one another.


Therefore the circle described with centre ``F`` and distance one of the straight lines ``FA``, ``FB``, ``FC`` will pass also through the remaining points, and the circle will have been circumscribed about the triangle ``ABC``.

Let it be circumscribed, as ``ABC``.

Next, let ``DF``, ``EF`` meet on the straight line ``BC`` at ``F``, as is the case in the second figure; and let ``AF`` be joined.

Then, similarly, we shall prove that the point ``F`` is the centre of the circle circumscribed about the triangle ``ABC``.

Again, let ``DF``, ``EF`` meet outside the triangle ``ABC`` at ``F``, as is the case in the third figure, and let ``AF``, ``BF``, ``CF`` be joined.

Then again, since ``AD`` is equal to ``DB``, and ``DF`` is common and at right angles, therefore the base ``AF`` is equal to the base ``BF``. [:ref:`I.4 <I.4>`]

Similarly we can prove that


.. container:: center

   ``CF`` is also equal to ``AF``;


so that ``BF`` is also equal to ``FC``; therefore the circle described with centre ``F`` and distance one of the straight lines ``FA``, ``FB``, ``FC`` will pass also through the remaining points, and will have been circumscribed about the triangle ``ABC``.

Therefore about the given triangle a circle has been circumscribed. Q. E. F.

And it is manifest that, when the centre of the circle falls within the triangle, the angle ``BAC``, being in a segment greater than the semicircle, is less than a right angle; when the centre falls on the straight line ``BC``, the angle ``BAC``, being in a semicircle, is right; and when the centre of the circle falls outside the triangle, the angle ``BAC``, being in a segment less than the semicircle, is greater than a right angle.
