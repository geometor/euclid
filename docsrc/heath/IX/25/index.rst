   If from an even number an odd number be subtracted, the remainder will be odd.

For from the even number AB let the odd number BC be subtracted; I say that the remainder CA is odd.

For let the unit CD be subtracted from BC; therefore DB is even. [:ref:`VII.def.7 <VII.def.7>`]

But AB is also even; therefore the remainder AD is also even. [:ref:`IX.24 <IX.24>`]

And CD is an unit; therefore CA is odd. [:ref:`VII.def.7 <VII.def.7>`] Q. E. D.
