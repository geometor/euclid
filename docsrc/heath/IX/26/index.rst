   If from an odd number an odd number be subtracted, the remainder will be even.

For from the odd number AB let the odd number BC be subtracted; I say that the remainder CA is even.

For, since AB is odd, let the unit BD be subtracted; therefore the remainder AD is even. [:ref:`VII.def.7 <VII.def.7>`]

For the same reason CD is also even; [:ref:`VII.def.7 <VII.def.7>`] so that the remainder CA is also even. [:ref:`IX.24 <IX.24>`] Q. E. D.
