   If a cube number by multiplying a cube number make some number, the product will be cube.

For let the cube number A by multiplying the cube number B make C; I say that C is cube.

For let A by multiplying itself make D; therefore D is cube. [:ref:`IX.3 <IX.3>`]

And, since A by multiplying itself has made D, and by multiplying B has made C therefore, as A is to B, so is D to C. [:ref:`VII.17 <VII.17>`]

And, since A, B are cube numbers, A, B are similar solid numbers.

Therefore two mean proportional numbers fall between A, B; [:ref:`VIII.19 <VIII.19>`] so that two mean proportional numbers will fall between D, C also. [:ref:`VIII.8 <VIII.8>`]

And D is cube; therefore C is also cube [:ref:`VIII.23 <VIII.23>`] Q. E. D.
