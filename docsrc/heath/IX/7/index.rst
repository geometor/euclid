   If a composite number by multiplying any number make some number, the product will be solid.

For let the composite number A by multiplying any number B make C; I say that C is solid.

For, since A is composite, it will be measured by some number. [:ref:`VII.def.13 <VII.def.13>`]

Let it be measured by D; and, as many times as D measures A, so many units let there be in E.

Since then D measures A according to the units in E, therefore E by multiplying D has made A. [:ref:`VII.def.15 <VII.def.15>`]

And, since A by multiplying B has made C, and A is the product of D, E, therefore the product of D, E by multiplying B has made C.

Therefore C is solid, and D, E, B are its sides. Q. E. D.
