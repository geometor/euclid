   To two given straight lines to find a mean proportional.

Let ``AB``, ``BC`` be the two given straight lines; thus it is required to find a mean proportional to ``AB``, ``BC``.

Let them be placed in a straight line, and let the semicircle ``ADC`` be described on ``AC``;

let ``BD`` be drawn from the point ``B`` at right angles to the straight line ``AC``, and let ``AD``, ``DC`` be joined.

Since the angle ``ADC`` is an angle in a semicircle, it is right. [:ref:`III.31 <III.31>`]

And, since, in the right-angled triangle ``ADC``, ``DB`` has been drawn from the right angle perpendicular to the base, therefore ``DB`` is a mean proportional between the segments of the base, ``AB``, ``BC``. [:ref:`VI.8.p.1 <VI.8.p.1>`]

Therefore to the two given straight lines ``AB``, ``BC`` a mean proportional ``DB`` has been found. Q. E. F.
