VI.18
=====

   On a given straight line to describe a rectilineal figure similar and similarly situated to a given rectilineal figure.

Let ``AB`` be the given straight line and ``CE`` the given rectilineal figure; thus it is required to describe on the straight line ``AB`` a rectilineal figure similar and similarly situated to the rectilineal figure ``CE``.

Let ``DF`` be joined, and on the straight line ``AB``, and at the points ``A``, ``B`` on it, let the angle ``GAB`` be constructed equal to the angle at ``C``, and the angle ``ABG`` equal to the angle ``CDF``. [:ref:`I.23 <I.23>`]

Therefore the remaining angle ``CFD`` is equal to the angle ``AGB``; [:ref:`I.32 <I.32>`]


.. container:: center

   therefore the triangle ``FCD`` is equiangular with the triangle ``GAB``.


Therefore, proportionally, as ``FD`` is to ``GB``, so is ``FC`` to ``GA``, and ``CD`` to ``AB``.

Again, on the straight line ``BG``, and at the points ``B``, ``G`` on it, let the angle ``BGH`` be constructed equal to the angle ``DFE``, and the angle ``GBH`` equal to the angle ``FDE``. [:ref:`I.23 <I.23>`]

Therefore the remaining angle at ``E`` is equal to the remaining angle at ``H``; [:ref:`I.32 <I.32>`]


.. container:: center

   therefore the triangle ``FDE`` is equiangular with the triangle ``GBH``; therefore, proportionally, as ``FD`` is to ``GB``, so is ``FE`` to ``GH``, and ``ED`` to ``HB``. [:ref:`VI.4 <VI.4>`]


But it was also proved that, as ``FD`` is to ``GB``, so is ``FC`` to ``GA``, and ``CD`` to ``AB``;


.. container:: center

   therefore also, as ``FC`` is to ``AG``, so is ``CD`` to ``AB``, and ``FE`` to ``GH``, and further ``ED`` to ``HB``.


And, since the angle ``CFD`` is equal to the angle ``AGB``, and the angle ``DFE`` to the angle ``BGH``, therefore the whole angle ``CFE`` is equal to the whole angle ``AGH``.

For the same reason


.. container:: center

   the angle ``CDE`` is also equal to the angle ``ABH``.


And the angle at ``C`` is also equal to the angle at ``A``,


.. container:: center

   and the angle at ``E`` to the angle at ``H``.


Therefore ``AH`` is equiangular with ``CE``; and they have the sides about their equal angles proportional;


.. container:: center

   therefore the rectilineal figure ``AH`` is similar to the rectilineal figure ``CE``. [:ref:`VI.def.1 <VI.def.1>`]


Therefore on the given straight line ``AB`` the rectilineal figure ``AH`` has been described similar and similarly situated to the given rectilineal figure ``CE``. Q. E. F.
