=====

   Figures which are similar to the same rectilineal figure are also similar to one another.

For let each of the rectilineal figures ``A``, ``B`` be similar to ``C``; I say that ``A`` is also similar to ``B``.

For, since ``A`` is similar to ``C``, it is equiangular with it and has the sides about the equal angles proportional. [:ref:`VI.def.1 <VI.def.1>`]

Again, since ``B`` is similar to ``C``, it is equiangular with it and has the sides about the equal angles proportional.

Therefore each of the figures ``A``, ``B`` is equiangular with ``C`` and with ``C`` has the sides about the equal angles proportional;

   therefore ``A`` is similar to ``B``. Q. E. D.
