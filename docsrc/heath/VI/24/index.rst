VI.24
=====

   In any parallelogram the parallelograms about the diameter are similar both to the whole and to one another.

Let ``ABCD`` be a parallelogram, and ``AC`` its diameter, and let ``EG``, ``HK`` be parallelograms about ``AC``; I say that each of the parallelograms ``EG``, ``HK`` is similar both to the whole ``ABCD`` and to the other.

For, since ``EF`` has been drawn parallel to ``BC``, one of the sides of the triangle ``ABC``,


.. container:: center

   proportionally, as ``BE`` is to ``EA``, so is ``CF`` to ``FA``. [:ref:`VI.2 <VI.2>`]


Again, since ``FG`` has been drawn parallel to ``CD``, one of the sides of the triangle ``ACD``,


.. container:: center

   proportionally, as ``CF`` is to ``FA``, so is ``DG`` to ``GA``. [:ref:`VI.2 <VI.2>`]


But it was proved that,


.. container:: center

   as ``CF`` is to ``FA``, so also is ``BE`` to ``EA``; therefore also, as ``BE`` is to ``EA``, so is ``DG`` to ``GA``,


and therefore, ``componendo``,


.. container:: center

   as ``BA`` is to ``AE``, so is ``DA`` to ``AG``, [:ref:`V.18 <V.18>`]


and, alternately,


.. container:: center

   as ``BA`` is to ``AD``, so is ``EA`` to ``AG``. [:ref:`V.16 <V.16>`]


Therefore in the parallelograms ``ABCD``, ``EG``, the sides about the common angle ``BAD`` are proportional.

And, since ``GF`` is parallel to ``DC``,


.. container:: center

   the angle ``AFG`` is equal to the angle ``DCA``;


and the angle ``DAC`` is common to the two triangles ``ADC``, ``AGF``;


.. container:: center

   therefore the triangle ``ADC`` is equiangular with the triangle ``AGF``.


For the same reason


.. container:: center

   the triangle ``ACB`` is also equiangular with the triangle ``AFE``,


and the whole parallelogram ``ABCD`` is equiangular with the parallelogram ``EG``.

Therefore, proportionally,


.. container:: center

   as ``AD`` is to ``DC``, so is ``AG`` to ``GF``, as ``DC`` is to ``CA``, so is ``GF`` to ``FA``, as ``AC`` is to ``CB``, so is ``AF`` to ``FE``,


and further, as ``CB`` is to ``BA``, so is ``FE`` to ``EA``.

And, since it was proved that,


.. container:: center

   as ``DC`` is to ``CA``, so is ``GF`` to ``FA``,


and, as ``AC`` is to ``CB``, so is ``AF`` to ``FE``, therefore, ex aequali, as ``DC`` is to ``CB``, so is ``GF`` to ``FE``. [:ref:`V.22 <V.22>`]

Therefore in the parallelograms ``ABCD``, ``EG`` the sides about the equal angles are proportional; therefore the parallelogram ``ABCD`` is similar to the parallelogram ``EG``. [:ref:`VI.def.1 <VI.def.1>`]

For the same reason the parallelogram ``ABCD`` is also similar to the parallelogram ``KH``; therefore each of the parallelograms ``EG``, ``HK`` is similar to ``ABCD``.

But figures similar to the same rectilineal figure are also similar to one another; [:ref:`VI.21 <VI.21>`] therefore the parallelogram ``EG`` is also similar to the parallelogram ``HK``.

Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
