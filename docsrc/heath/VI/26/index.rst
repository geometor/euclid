VI.26
=====

   If from a parallelogram there be taken away a parallelogram similar and similarly situated to the whole and having a common angle with it, it is about the same diameter with the whole

For from the parallelogram ``ABCD`` let there be taken away the parallelogram ``AF`` similar and similarly situated to ``ABCD``, and having the angle ``DAB`` common with it;

I say that ``ABCD`` is about the same diameter with ``AF``.

For suppose it is not, but, if possible, let ``AHC`` be the diameter < of ``ABCD`` >, let ``GF`` be produced and carried through to ``H``, and let ``HK`` be drawn through ``H`` parallel to either of the straight lines ``AD``, ``BC``. [:ref:`I.31 <I.31>`]

Since, then, ``ABCD`` is about the same diameter with ``KG``, therefore, as ``DA`` is to ``AB``, so is ``GA`` to ``AK``. [:ref:`VI.24 <VI.24>`]

But also, because of the similarity of ``ABCD``, ``EG``,


.. container:: center

   as ``DA`` is to ``AB``, so is ``GA`` to ``AE``;


therefore also, as ``GA`` is to ``AK``, so is ``GA`` to ``AE``. [:ref:`V.11 <V.11>`]

Therefore ``GA`` has the same ratio to each of the straight lines ``AK``, ``AE``.

Therefore ``AE`` is equal to ``AK`` [:ref:`V.9 <V.9>`], the less to the greater : which is impossible.

Therefore ``ABCD`` cannot but be about the same diameter with ``AF``; therefore the parallelogram ``ABCD`` is about the same diameter with the parallelogram ``AF``.

Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
