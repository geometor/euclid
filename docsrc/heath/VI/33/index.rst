VI.33
=====

   In equal circles angles have the same ratio as the circumferences on which they stand, whether they stand at the centres or at the circumferences.

Let ``ABC``, ``DEF`` be equal circles, and let the angles ``BGC``, ``EHF`` be angles at their centres ``G``, ``H``, and the angles ``BAC``, ``EDF`` angles at the circumferences; I say that, as the circumference ``BC`` is to the circumference ``EF``, so is the angle ``BGC`` to the angle ``EHF``, and the angle ``BAC`` to the angle ``EDF``.

For let any number of consecutive circumferences ``CK``, ``KL`` be made equal to the circumference ``BC``, and any number of consecutive circumferences ``FM``, ``MN`` equal to the circumference ``EF``; and let ``GK``, ``GL``, ``HM``, ``HN`` be joined.

Then, since the circumferences ``BC``, ``CK``, ``KL`` are equal to one another, the angles ``BGC``, ``CGK``, ``KGL`` are also equal to one another; [:ref:`III.27 <III.27>`] therefore, whatever multiple the circumference ``BL`` is of ``BC``, that multiple also is the angle ``BGL`` of the angle ``BGC``.

For the same reason also, whatever multiple the circumference ``NE`` is of ``EF``, that multiple also is the angle ``NHE`` of the angle ``EHF``.

If then the circumference ``BL`` is equal to the circumference ``EN``, the angle ``BGL`` is also equal to the angle ``EHN``; [:ref:`III.27 <III.27>`] if the circumference ``BL`` is greater than the circumference ``EN``, the angle ``BGL`` is also greater than the angle ``EHN``; and, if less, less.

There being then four magnitudes, two circumferences ``BC``, ``EF``, and two angles ``BGC``, ``EHF``, there have been taken, of the circumference ``BC`` and the angle ``BGC`` equimultiples, namely the circumference ``BL`` and the angle ``BGL``, and of the circumference ``EF`` and the angle ``EHF`` equimultiples, namely the circumference ``EN`` and the angle ``EHN``.

And it has been proved that, if the circumference ``BL`` is in excess of the circumference ``EN``, the angle ``BGL`` is also in excess of the angle ``EHN``; if equal, equal; and if less, less.

Therefore, as the circumference ``BC`` is to ``EF``, so is the angle ``BGC`` to the angle ``EHF``. [:ref:`V.def.5 <V.def.5>`]

But, as the angle ``BGC`` is to the angle ``EHF``, so is the angle ``BAC`` to the angle ``EDF``; for they are doubles respectively.

Therefore also, as the circumference ``BC`` is to the circumference ``EF``, so is the angle ``BGC`` to the angle ``EHF``, and the angle ``BAC`` to the angle ``EDF``.

Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
