   If two triangles have one angle equal to one angle, the sides about other angles proportional, and the remaining angles either both less or both not less than a right angle, the triangles will be equiangular and will have those angles equal, the sides about which are proportional.

``If two triangles have one angle equal to one angle``, ``the sides about other angles proportional``, ``and the remaining angles either both less or both not less than a right angle``, ``the triangles will be equiangular and will have those angles equal``, ``the sides about which are proportional``.

Let ``ABC``, ``DEF`` be two triangles having one angle equal to one angle, the angle ``BAC`` to the angle ``EDF``, the sides about other angles ``ABC``, ``DEF`` proportional, so that, as ``AB`` is to ``BC``, so is ``DE`` to ``EF``, and, first, each of the remaining angles at ``C``, ``F`` less than a right angle;

I say that the triangle ``ABC`` is equiangular with the triangle ``DEF``, the angle ``ABC`` will be equal to the angle ``DEF``, and the remaining angle, namely the angle at ``C``, equal to the remaining angle, the angle at ``F``.

For, if the angle ``ABC`` is unequal to the angle ``DEF``, one of them is greater.

Let the angle ``ABC`` be greater; and on the straight line ``AB``, and at the point ``B`` on it, let the angle ``ABG`` be constructed equal to the angle ``DEF``. [:ref:`I.23 <I.23>`]

Then, since the angle ``A`` is equal to ``D``, and the angle ``ABG`` to the angle ``DEF``, therefore the remaining angle ``AGB`` is equal to the remaining angle ``DFE``. [:ref:`I.32 <I.32>`]

Therefore the triangle ``ABG`` is equiangular with the triangle ``DEF``.

Therefore, as ``AB`` is to ``BG``, so is ``DE`` to ``EF`` [:ref:`VI.4 <VI.4>`]

But, as ``DE`` is to ``EF``, so by hypothesis is ``AB`` to ``BC``; therefore ``AB`` has the same ratio to each of the straight lines ``BC``, ``BG``; [:ref:`V.11 <V.11>`]


.. container:: center

   therefore ``BC`` is equal to ``BG``, [:ref:`V.9 <V.9>`]


so that the angle at ``C`` is also equal to the angle ``BGC``. [:ref:`I.5 <I.5>`]

But, by hypothesis, the angle at ``C`` is less than a right angle; therefore the angle ``BGC`` is also less than a right angle; so that the angle ``AGB`` adjacent to it is greater than a right angle. [:ref:`I.13 <I.13>`]

And it was proved equal to the angle at ``F``; therefore the angle at ``F`` is also greater than a right angle.

But it is by hypothesis less than a right angle : which is absurd.

Therefore the angle ``ABC`` is not unequal to the angle ``DEF``; therefore it is equal to it.

But the angle at ``A`` is also equal to the angle at ``D``; therefore the remaining angle at ``C`` is equal to the remaining angle at ``F``. [:ref:`I.32 <I.32>`]

Therefore the triangle ``ABC`` is equiangular with the triangle ``DEF``.

But, again, let each of the angles at ``C``, ``F`` be supposed not less than a right angle; I say again that, in this case too, the triangle ``ABC`` is equiangular with the triangle ``DEF``.

For, with the same construction, we can prove similarly that


.. container:: center

   ``BC`` is equal to ``BG``;


so that the angle at ``C`` is also equal to the angle ``BGC``. [:ref:`I.5 <I.5>`]

But the angle at ``C`` is not less than a right angle; therefore neither is the angle ``BGC`` less than a right angle.

Thus in the triangle ``BGC`` the two angles are not less than two right angles: which is impossible. [:ref:`I.17 <I.17>`]

Therefore, once more, the angle ``ABC`` is not unequal to the angle ``DEF``; therefore it is equal to it.

But the angle at ``A`` is also equal to the angle at ``D``; therefore the remaining angle at ``C`` is equal to the remaining angle at ``F``. [:ref:`I.32 <I.32>`]

Therefore the triangle ``ABC`` is equiangular with the triangle ``DEF``.

Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
