VI.8
====

   If in a right-angled triangle a perpendicular be drawn from the right angle to the base, the triangles adjoining the perpendicular are similar both to the whole and to one another.

Let ``ABC`` be a right-angled triangle having the angle ``BAC`` right, and let ``AD`` be drawn from ``A`` perpendicular to ``BC``; I say that each of the triangles ``ABD``, ``ADC`` is similar to the whole ``ABC`` and, further, they are similar to one another.

For, since the angle ``BAC`` is equal to the angle ``ADB``, for each is right, and the angle at ``B`` is common to the two triangles ``ABC`` and ``ABD``, therefore the remaining angle ``ACB`` is equal to the remaining angle ``BAD``; [:ref:`I.32 <I.32>`]

therefore the triangle ``ABC`` is equiangular with the triangle ``ABD``.

Therefore, as ``BC`` which subtends the right angle in the triangle ``ABC`` is to ``BA`` which subtends the right angle in the triangle ``ABD``, so is ``AB`` itself which subtends the angle at ``C`` in the triangle ``ABC`` to ``BD`` which subtends the equal angle ``BAD`` in the triangle ``ABD``, and so also is ``AC`` to ``AD`` which subtends the angle at ``B`` common to the two triangles. [:ref:`VI.4 <VI.4>`]

Therefore the triangle ``ABC`` is both equiangular to the triangle ``ABD`` and has the sides about the equal angles proportional.

Therefore the triangle ``ABC`` is similar to the triangle ``ABD``. [:ref:`VI.def.1 <VI.def.1>`]

Similarly we can prove that the triangle ``ABC`` is also similar to the triangle ``ADC``; therefore each of the triangles ``ABD``, ``ADC`` is similar to the whole ``ABC``.

I say next that the triangles ``ABD``, ``ADC`` are also similar to one another.

For, since the right angle ``BDA`` is equal to the right angle ``ADC``, and moreover the angle ``BAD`` was also proved equal to the angle at ``C``, therefore the remaining angle at ``B`` is also equal to the remaining angle ``DAC``; [:ref:`I.32 <I.32>`] therefore the triangle ``ABD`` is equiangular with the triangle ``ADC``.

Therefore, as ``BD`` which subtends the angle ``BAD`` in the triangle ``ABD`` is to ``DA`` which subtends the angle at ``C`` in the triangle ``ADC`` equal to the angle ``BAD``, so is ``AD`` itself which subtends the angle at ``B`` in the triangle ``ABD`` to ``DC`` which subtends the angle ``DAC`` in the triangle ``ADC`` equal to the angle at ``B``, and so also is ``BA`` to ``AC``, these sides subtending the right angles; [:ref:`VI.4 <VI.4>`] therefore the triangle ``ABD`` is similar to the triangle ``ADC``. [:ref:`VI.def.1 <VI.def.1>`]

Therefore etc.

From this it is clear that, if in a right-angled triangle a perpendicular be drawn from the right angle to the base, the straight line so drawn is a mean proportional between the segments of the base. Q. E. D.
