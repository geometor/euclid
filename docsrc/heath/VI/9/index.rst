   From a given straight line to cut off a prescribed part.

Let ``AB`` be the given straight line; thus it is required to cut off from ``AB`` a prescribed part.

Let the third part be that prescribed.

Let a straight line ``AC`` be drawn through from ``A`` containing with ``AB`` any angle; let a point ``D`` be taken at random on ``AC``, and let ``DE``, ``EC`` be made equal to ``AD``. [:ref:`I.3 <I.3>`]

Let ``BC`` be joined, and through ``D`` let ``DF`` be drawn parallel to it. [:ref:`I.31 <I.31>`]

Then, since ``FD`` has been drawn parallel to ``BC``, one of the sides of the triangle ``ABC``, therefore, proportionally, as ``CD`` is to ``DA``, so is ``BF`` to ``FA``. [:ref:`VI.2 <VI.2>`]

But ``CD`` is double of ``DA``;

   therefore ``BF`` is also double of ``FA``; therefore ``BA`` is triple of ``AF``.


Therefore from the given straight line ``AB`` the prescribed third part ``AF`` has been cut off. Q. E. F.
any angle. The expression here and in the two following propositions is τυχοῦσα γωνία, corresponding exactly to τυχὸν σημεῖον which I have translated as a point (taken) ``at random``
; but an angle (taken) at random
would not be so appropriate where it is a question, not of ``taking`` any angle at all, but of drawing a straight line casually so as to make any angle with another straight line.
