   If four numbers be proportional, they will also be proportional alternately.

Let the four numbers A, B, C, D be proportional, so that,


.. container:: center

   as A is to B, so is C to D;


I say that they will also be proportional alternately, so that,


.. container:: center

   as A is to C, so will B be to D.


For since, as A is to B, so is C to D, therefore, whatever part or parts A is of B, the same part or the same parts is C of D also. [:ref:`VII.def.20 <VII.def.20>`]

Therefore, alternately, whatever part or parts A is of C, the same part or the same parts is B of D also. [:ref:`VII.10 <VII.10>`]

Therefore, as A is to C, so is B to D. [:ref:`VII.def.20 <VII.def.20>`] Q. E. D.
