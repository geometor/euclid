   If a number be measured by any number, the number which is measured will have a part called by the same name as the measuring number.

For let the number A be measured by any number B; I say that A has a part called by the same name as B.

For, as many times as B measures A, so many units let there be in C.

Since B measures A according to the units in C, and the unit D also measures the number C according to the units in it, therefore the unit D measures the number C the same number of times as B measures A.

Therefore, alternately, the unit D measures the number B the same number of times as C measures A; [:ref:`VII.15 <VII.15>`] therefore, whatever part the unit D is of the number B, the same part is C of A also.

But the unit D is a part of the number B called by the same name as it; therefore C is also a part of A called by the same name as B, so that A has a part C which is called by the same name as B. Q. E. D.
