VIII.15
=======

   If a cube number measure a cube number, the side will also measure the side; and, if the side measure the side, the cube will also measure the cube.

For let the cube number A measure the cube B, and let C be the side of A and D of B; I say that C measures D.

For let C by multiplying itself make E, and let D by multiplying itself make G; further, let C by multiplying D make F, and let C, D by multiplying F make H, K respectively.

Now it is manifest that E, F, G and A, H, K, B are continuously proportional in the ratio of C to D. [:ref:`VIII.11 <VIII.11>` :ref:`VIII.12 <VIII.12>`]

And, since A, H, K, B are continuously proportional, and A measures B, therefore it also measures H. [:ref:`VIII.7 <VIII.7>`]

And, as A is to H, so is C to D; therefore C also measures D. [:ref:`VII.def.20 <VII.def.20>`]

Next, let C measure D; I say that A will also measure B.

For, with the same construction, we can prove in a similar manner that A, H, K, B are continuously proportional in the ratio of C to D.

And, since C measures D, and, as C is to D, so is A to H, therefore A also measures H, [:ref:`VII.def.20 <VII.def.20>`] so that A measures B also. Q. E. D.
