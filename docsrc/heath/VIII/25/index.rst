   If two numbers have to one another the ratio which a cube number has to a cube number, and the first be cube, the second will also be cube.

For let the two numbers A, B have to one another the ratio which the cube number C has to the cube number D, and let A be cube; I say that B is also cube.

For, since C, D are cube, C, D are similar solid numbers.

Therefore two mean proportional numbers fall between C, D. [:ref:`VIII.19 <VIII.19>`]

And, as many numbers as fall between C, D in continued proportion, so many will also fall between those which have the same ratio with them; [:ref:`VIII.8 <VIII.8>`] so that two mean proportional numbers fall between A, B also.

Let E, F so fall.

Since, then, the four numbers A, E, F, B are in continued proportion, and A is cube, therefore B is also cube. [:ref:`VIII.23 <VIII.23>`] Q. E. D.
