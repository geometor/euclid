   A straight line commensurable with an apotome of a medial straight line is an apotome of a medial straight line and the same in order.

Let AB be an apotome of a medial straight line, and let CD be commensurable in length with AB; I say that CD is also an apotome of a medial straight line and the same in order with AB.

For, since AB is an apotome of a medial straight line, let EB be the annex to it.

Therefore AE, EB are medial straight lines commensurable in square only. [:ref:`X.74 <X.74>` :ref:`X.75 <X.75>`]

Let it be contrived that, as AB is to CD, so is BE to DF; [:ref:`VI.12 <VI.12>`] therefore AE is also commensurable with CF, and BE with DF. [:ref:`V.12 <V.12>`, :ref:`X.11 <X.11>`]

But AE, EB are medial straight lines commensurable in square only; therefore CF, FD are also medial straight lines [:ref:`X.23 <X.23>`] commensurable in square only; [:ref:`X.13 <X.13>`] therefore CD is an apotome of a medial straight line. [:ref:`X.74 <X.74>` :ref:`X.75 <X.75>`]

I say next that it is also the same in order with AB.

Since, as AE is to EB, so is CF to FD, therefore also, as the square on AE is to the rectangle AE, EB, so is the square on CF to the rectangle CF, FD.

But the square on AE is commensurable with the square on CF; therefore the rectangle AE, EB is also commensurable with the rectangle CF, FD. [:ref:`V.16 <V.16>`, :ref:`X.11 <X.11>`]

Therefore, if the rectangle AE, EB is rational, the rectangle CF, FD will also be rational, [:ref:`X.def.4 <X.def.4>`] and if the rectangle AE, EB is medial, the rectangle CF, FD is also medial. [:ref:`X.23.p.1 <X.23.p.1>`]

Therefore CD is an apotome of a medial straight line and the same in order with AB. [:ref:`X.74 <X.74>` :ref:`X.75 <X.75>`] Q. E. D.
