   If from a medial area a rational area be subtracted, there arise two other irrational straight lines, either a first apotome of a medial straight line or a straight line which produces with a rational area a medial whole.

For from the medial area BC let the rational area BD be subtracted.

I say that the side
of the remainder EC becomes one of two irrational straight lines, either a first apotome of a medial straight line or a straight line which produces with a rational area a medial whole.

For let a rational straight line FG be set out, and let the areas be similarly applied.

It follows then that FH is rational and incommensurable in length with FG, while KF is rational and commensurable in length with FG; therefore FH, FK are rational straight lines commensurable in square only; [:ref:`X.13 <X.13>`] therefore KH is an apotome, and FK the annex to it. [:ref:`X.73 <X.73>`]

Now the square on HF is greater than the square on FK either by the square on a straight line commensurable with HF or by the square on a straight line incommensurable with it.

If then the square on HF is greater than the square on FK by the square on a straight line commensurable with HF, while the annex FK is commensurable in length with the rational straight line FG set out, KH is a second apotome. [:ref:`X.def.3.2 <X.def.3.2>`]

But FG is rational; so that the side
of LH, that is, of EC, is a first apotome of a medial straight line. [:ref:`X.92 <X.92>`]

But, if the square on HF is greater than the square on FK by the square on a straight line incommensurable with HF, while the annex FK is commensurable in length with the rational straight line FG set out, KH is a fifth apotome; [:ref:`X.def.3.5 <X.def.3.5>`] so that the side
of EC is a straight line which produces with a rational area a medial whole. [:ref:`X.95 <X.95>`]
