X.8
===

   If two magnitudes have not to one another the ratio which a number has to a number, the magnitudes will be incommensurable.

For let the two magnitudes A, B not have to one another the ratio which a number has to a number; I say that the magnitudes A, B are incommensurable.

For, if they are commensurable, A will have to B the ratio which a number has to a number. [:ref:`X.5 <X.5>`]

But it has not; therefore the magnitudes A, B are incommensurable.

Therefore etc.
