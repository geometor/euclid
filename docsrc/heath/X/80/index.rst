   To a first apotome of a medial straight line only one medial straight line can be annexed which is commensurable with the whole in square only and which contains with the whole a rational rectangle.

For let AB be a first apotome of a medial straight line, and let BC be an annex to AB; therefore AC, CB are medial straight lines commensurable in square only and such that the rectangle AC, CB which they contain is rational; [:ref:`X.74 <X.74>`] I say that no other medial straight line can be annexed to AB which is commensurable with the whole in square only and which contains with the whole a rational area.

For, if possible, let DB also be so annexed; therefore AD, DB are medial straight lines commensurable in square only and such that the rectangle AD, DB which they contain is rational. [:ref:`X.74 <X.74>`]

Now, since the excess of the squares on AD, DB over twice the rectangle AD, DB is also the excess of the squares on AC, CB over twice the rectangle AC, CB, for they exceed by the same, the square on AB, [:ref:`II.7 <II.7>`] therefore, alternately, the excess of the squares on AD, DB over the squares on AC, CB is also the excess of twice the rectangle AD, DB over twice the rectangle AC, CB.

But twice the rectangle AD, DB exceeds twice the rectangle AC, CB by a rational area, for both are rational.

Therefore the squares on AD, DB also exceed the squares on AC, CB by a rational area. which is impossible, for both are medial [:ref:`X.15 <X.15>` :ref:`X.23.p.1 <X.23.p.1>`], and a medial area does not exceed a medial by a rational area. [:ref:`X.26 <X.26>`]

Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
