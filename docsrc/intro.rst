GEOMETOR • euclid
=================

The ``geometor.euclid`` project is dedicated to the **semantic discovery** and structural analysis of Euclid's *Elements*. 

It serves as the foundation for digital geometry by:

-   **Ingesting** raw text and diagrams from the Heath edition.
-   **Parsing** the logical structure (Book, Proposition, Definition, etc.).
-   **Mapping** dependencies to create a directed graph of logical precedence.
-   **Providing** a structured data source for downstream modeling and analysis (see ``geometor.elements``).
