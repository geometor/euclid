<p>enunciation note</p>
<p>In an English translation of the enunciation of this proposition it is
absolutely necessary, in order to make it intelligible, to insert some
words which are not in the Greek. The reason is partly that the Greek
enunciation is itself very elliptical, and partly that some words used in
it conveyed more meaning than the corresponding words in English do.
Particularly is this the case with &lt;foreign lang=”greek”&gt;οὐ συσταθήσονται
ἐπί&lt;/foreign&gt; &lt;quote&gt;there shall not be constructed upon,&lt;/quote&gt; since
&lt;foreign lang=”greek”&gt;συνίστασθαι&lt;/foreign&gt; is the regular word for
constructing a &lt;em&gt;triangle&lt;/em&gt; in particular. Thus a Greek would easily
understahd &lt;foreign lang=”greek”&gt;συσταθήσονται ἐπί&lt;/foreign&gt; as meaning the
construction of two lines &lt;em&gt;forming a triangle on&lt;/em&gt; a given straight
line as base; whereas to &lt;quote&gt;construct two straight lines on a straight
line&lt;/quote&gt; is not in English sufficiently definite unless we explain that
they are drawn from the &lt;em&gt;ends&lt;/em&gt; of the straight line to &lt;em&gt;meet&lt;/em&gt;
at a point. I have had the less hesitation in putting in the words
&lt;quote&gt;from its extremities&lt;/quote&gt; because they are actually used by
Euclid in the somewhat similar enunciation of &lt;a href=”/elem.1.21”&gt;I.
21&lt;/a&gt;.  How impossible a literal translation into English is, if it is to
convey the meaning of the enunciation intelligibly, will be clear from the
following attempt to render literally: &lt;quote&gt;On the same straight line
there shall not be constructed two other straight lines equal, each to
each, to the same two straight lines, (terminating) at different points on
the same side, having the same extremities as the original straight
lines&lt;/quote&gt; (&lt;foreign lang=”greek”&gt;ἐπὶ τῆς αὐτῆς εὐθείας δύο ταῖς αὐταῖς
εὐθείαις ἄλλαι δύο εὐθεῖαι ἴσαι ἑκατὲρα ἑκατέρα οὐ συσταθήσονται πρὸς ἄλλῳ
καἰ ἄλλῳ σημείῳ ἐπἰ τὰ αὐτὰ μέρη τὰ αὐτὰ πέρατα ἔχουσαι ταῖς ἐξ ἀρχῆς
εὐθείαις&lt;/foreign&gt;).</p>
<p>The reason why Euclid allowed himself to use, in this enunciation, language
apparently so obscure is no doubt that the phraseology was traditional and
therefore, vague as it was, had a conventional meaning which the
contemporary geometer well understood. This is proved, I think, by the
occurrence in Aristotle (&lt;xref n=”Aristot. Meteo. 376a.2” from=”ROOT”
to=”DITTO”&gt;&lt;title&gt;Meteorologica&lt;/title&gt; III. 5, 376 a 2 sqq.&lt;/xref&gt;) of the
very same, evidently technical, expressions. Aristotle is there alluding to
the theorem given by Eutocius from Apollonius’ &lt;title&gt;Plane Loci&lt;/title&gt; to
the effect that, if <strong>H</strong>, <strong>K</strong> be two fixed points and <strong>M</strong> such a
variable point that the ratio of <strong>MH</strong> to <strong>MK</strong> is a given ratio (not one
of equality), the locus of <strong>M</strong> is a circle. (For an account of this
theorem see note on &lt;a href=”/elem.6.3”&gt;VI. 3&lt;/a&gt; below.) Now Aristotle
says &lt;quote&gt;The lines drawn up from <strong>H</strong>, <strong>K</strong> in this ratio cannot be
constructed to two different points of the semicircle <strong>A</strong> &lt;/quote&gt;
(&lt;foreign lang=”greek”&gt;αἰ οὖν ἀπὸ τῶν ΗΚ ἀναγόμεναι γραμμαὶ ἐν τούτῳ τῷ
λόγῳ οὐ συσταθήσουται τοῦ ἐφ̓ ᾦ Α ἡμικυκλίου πρὸς ἄλλο καὶ ἄλλο
σημεῖον&lt;/foreign&gt;).</p>
<p>If a paraphrase is allowed instead of a translation adhering as closely as
possible to the original, Simson’s is the best that could be found, since
the fact that the straight lines form &lt;em&gt;triangles&lt;/em&gt; on the same base
is really conveyed in the Greek. Simson’s enunciation is, &lt;title&gt;Upon the
same base&lt;/title&gt;, &lt;em&gt;and on the same side of it&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;there cannot be
two triangles that have their sides which are terminated in one extremity
of the base equal to one another&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;and likewise those which are
terminated at the other extremity&lt;/em&gt;. Th. Taylor (the translator of
Proclus) attacks Simson’s alteration as &lt;quote&gt;indiscreet&lt;/quote&gt; and as
detracting from the beauty and accuracy of Euclid’s enunciation which are
enlarged upon by Proclus in his commentary. Yet, when Taylor says
&lt;quote&gt;Whatever difficulty learners may find in conceiving this proposition
abstractedly is easily removed by its exposition in the figure,&lt;/quote&gt; he
really gives his case away. The fact is that Taylor, always enthusiastic
over his author, was nettled by Simson’s slighting remarks on Proclus’
comments on the proposition. Simson had said, with reference to Proclus’
explanation of the bearing of the second part of &lt;a href=”/elem.1.5”&gt;I.
5&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=”/elem.1.7”&gt;I. 7&lt;/a&gt;, that it was not &lt;quote&gt;worth while
to relate his trifles at full length,&lt;/quote&gt; to which Taylor retorts
&lt;quote&gt;But Mr Simson was no philosopher; and therefore the greatest part of
these Commentaries must be considered by him as trifles, from the want of a
philosophic genius to comprehend their meaning, and a taste superior to
that of a &lt;em&gt;mere mathematician&lt;/em&gt;, to discover their beauty and
elegance.&lt;/quote&gt;</p>

<p>equal to the angle</p>
<p>It would be natural to insert here the step &lt;quote&gt;but the angle <strong>ACD</strong> is
greater than the angle <strong>BCD</strong>. [&lt;a href=”/elem.1.c.n.5”&gt;C.N.

&lt;quote&gt;&lt;em&gt;much more then&lt;/em&gt; is the angle <strong>BDC</strong> greater than the angle
<strong>BCD</strong>,&lt;/quote&gt; but the Greek for this would have to be &lt;foreign
lang=”greek”&gt;πολλῷ&lt;/foreign&gt; (or &lt;foreign lang=”greek”&gt;πολὺ[ρπαρ  ] μᾶλλόν
ἐστι…μείζων. πολλῷ μᾶλλον&lt;/foreign&gt;, however, though used by Apollonius,
is not, apparently, found in Euclid or Archimedes.</p>
