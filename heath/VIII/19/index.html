          <div><p>Between two similar solid numbers there fall two mean proportional numbers; and the solid number has to the similar solid number the ratio triplicate of that which the corresponding side has to the corresponding side.</p>
          </div></blockquote>
          <p>Let A, B be two similar solid numbers, and let C, D, E be the sides of A, and F, G, H of B.</p>
          <p>Now, since similar solid numbers are those which have their sides proportional, [<a class="reference internal" href="../../VII/def.21/index.html#vii-def-21"><span class="std std-ref">VII.def.21</span></a>] therefore, as C is to D, so is F to G,</p>
          <div class="center docutils container">
          <p>and, as D is to E, so is G to H.</p>
          </div>
          <p>I say that between A, B there fall two mean proportional numbers, and A has to B the ratio triplicate of that which C has to F, D to G, and also E to H.</p>
          <p>For let C by multiplying D make K, and let F by multiplying G make L.</p>
          <p>Now, since C, D are in the same ratio with F, G, and K is the product of C, D, and L the product of F, G, K, L are similar plane numbers; [<a class="reference internal" href="../../VII/def.21/index.html#vii-def-21"><span class="std std-ref">VII.def.21</span></a>] therefore between K, L there is one mean proportional number. [<a class="reference internal" href="../18/index.html#viii-18"><span class="std std-ref">VIII.18</span></a>]</p>
          <p>Let it be M</p>
          <p>Therefore M is the product of D, F, as was proved in the theorem preceding this. [<a class="reference internal" href="../18/index.html#viii-18"><span class="std std-ref">VIII.18</span></a>]</p>
          <p>Now, since D by multiplying C has made K, and by multiplying F has made M, therefore, as C is to F, so is K to M. [<a class="reference internal" href="../../VII/17/index.html#vii-17"><span class="std std-ref">VII.17</span></a>]</p>
          <p>But, as K is to M, so is M to L.</p>
          <p>Therefore K, M, L are continuously proportional in the ratio of C to F.</p>
          <p>And since, as C is to D, so is F to G, alternately therefore, as C is to F, so is D to G. [<a class="reference internal" href="../../VII/13/index.html#vii-13"><span class="std std-ref">VII.13</span></a>]</p>
          <p>For the same reason also,</p>
          <div class="center docutils container">
          <p>as D is to G, so is E to H.</p>
          </div>
          <p>Therefore K, M, L are continuously proportional in the ratio of C to F, in the ratio of D to G, and also in the ratio of E to H.</p>
          <p>Next, let E, H by multiplying M make N, O respectively.</p>
          <p>Now, since A is a solid number, and C, D, E are its sides, therefore E by multiplying the product of C, D has made A.</p>
          <p>But the product of C, D is K; therefore E by multiplying K has made A.</p>
          <p>For the same reason also</p>
          <div class="center docutils container">
          <p>H by multiplying L has made B.</p>
          </div>
          <p>Now, since E by multiplying K has made A, and further also by multiplying M has made N, therefore, as K is to M, so is A to N. [<a class="reference internal" href="../../VII/17/index.html#vii-17"><span class="std std-ref">VII.17</span></a>]</p>
          <p>But, as K is to M, so is C to F, D to G, and also E to H; therefore also, as C is to F, D to G, and E to H, so is A to N.</p>
          <p>Again, since E, H by multiplying M have made N, O respectively, therefore, as E is to H, so is N to O. [<a class="reference internal" href="../../VII/18/index.html#vii-18"><span class="std std-ref">VII.18</span></a>]</p>
          <p>But, as E is to H, so is C to F and D to G; therefore also, as C is to F, D to G, and E to H, so is A to N and N to O.</p>
          <p>Again, since H by multiplying M has made O, and further also by multiplying L has made B, therefore, as M is to L, so is O to B. [<a class="reference internal" href="../../VII/17/index.html#vii-17"><span class="std std-ref">VII.17</span></a>]</p>
          <p>But, as M is to L, so is C to F, D to G, and E to H.</p>
          <p>Therefore also, as C is to F, D to G, and E to H, so not only is O to B, but also A to N and N to O.</p>
          <p>Therefore A, N, O, B are continuously proportional in the aforesaid ratios of the sides.</p>
          <p>I say that A also has to B the ratio triplicate of that which the corresponding side has to the corresponding side, that is, of the ratio which the number C has to F, or D to G, and also E to H.</p>
          <p>For, since A, N, O, B are four numbers in continued proportion, therefore A has to B the ratio triplicate of that which A has to N. [<a class="reference internal" href="../../V/def.10/index.html#v-def-10"><span class="std std-ref">V.def.10</span></a>]</p>
          <p>But, as A is to N, so it was proved that C is to F, D to G, and also E to H.</p>
          <p>Therefore A also has to B the ratio triplicate of that which the corresponding side has to the corresponding side, that is, of the ratio which the number C has to F, D to G, and also E to H. Q. E. D.</p>
