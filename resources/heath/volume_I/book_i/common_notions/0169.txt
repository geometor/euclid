DEFINITION

A p o i n t is that which has no part.
A n exactly parallel u s e of f*tpos ( « r n ) i n t h e singular is f o u n d in Aristotle,
Metaph. 1035 b 32 p.ipo% piv ovv eori xal rov efSovs, literally " T h e r e is a
part even of t h e form " ; B o n i t z t r a n s l a t e s a s if t h e plural w e r e u s e d , " T h e i l e
giebt e s , " a n d t h e m e a n i n g is simply " e v e n t h e form is divisible (into p a r t s ) . "
Accordingly it would b e q u i t e justifiable t o t r a n s l a t e i n t h i s c a s e " A p o i n t is
t h a t which is indivisible into parts."
M a r t i a n u s C a p e l l a (5th c. A . D . ) a l o n e o r a l m o s t a l o n e t r a n s l a t e d differently,
" P u n c t u m e s t cuius pars nihil est," " a p o i n t is t h a t a p a r t of w h i c h is nothing."

I t would a p p e a r t h a t this was n o t t h e definition g i v e n i n earlier text­
b o o k s ; for Aristotle (Topics v i . 4, 141 b 20), in s p e a k i n g of "the d e f i n i t i o n s "
of point, line, a n d surface, says t h a t t h e y all define t h e p r i o r b y m e a n s of t h e

u s e d by Aristotle, either in this exact form (cf. De anima 1. 4, 409 a 6) o r its
e q u i v a l e n t : e.g. in Metaph. 1 0 1 6 b 24 h e says t h a t t h a t w h i c h is indivisible
every way i n respect of m a g n i t u d e a n d qud, m a g n i t u d e b u t h a s n o t p o s i t i o n is
