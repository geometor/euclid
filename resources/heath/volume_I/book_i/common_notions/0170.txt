I t would a p p e a r therefore that, w h e n Aristotle objects to
t h e definition of a p o i n t as t h e extremity of a line (irepo? ypappiji) as un­
scientific (Topics v i . 4, 141 b 21), h e is a i m i n g at P l a t o . H e i b e r g conjectures

t h e w o r d for " p o i n t " generally u s e d by Aristotle (<rri.yp.rj) was replaced by

for a point.
Aristotle's c o n c e p t i o n of a p o i n t as t h a t which is indivisible a n d h a s
position is further illustrated by s u c h observations as t h a t a point is not a
body (De caelo 11. 13, 296 a 17) a n d h a s n o weight (ibid. m . 1, 299 a 30);

it is (Physics iv. 1, 209 a n ) . H e finds t h e usual difficulty in a c c o u n t i n g for
t h e transition from t h e indivisible, or infinitely small, t o t h e finite or divisible
m a g n i t u d e . A p o i n t b e i n g indivisible, n o a c c u m u l a t i o n of points, however far

a line is n o t made up of p o i n t s (ov trvyicttTcu « tmypjav, Physics iv. 8, 215

n o t a part of t i m e , it is only t h e b e g i n n i n g o r e n d , or a division, of time, a n d
similarly a p o i n t m a y b e a n extremity, b e g i n n i n g o r division of a line, b u t is
n o t part of it o r of m a g n i t u d e (cf. De caelo m . 1, 300 a 14, Physics iv. 1 1 ,
220 a 1 — 2 1 , v i . 1, 231 b 6 sqq.). I t is only by motion t h a t a point c a n

Other ancient definitions.
A c c o r d i n g t o an-Nairizi (ed. C u r t z e , p . 3) o n e " H e r u n d e s " (not so far
identified) defined a p o i n t as " t h e indivisible b e g i n n i n g of all m a g n i t u d e s , "
a n d P o s i d o n i u s as " a n e x t r e m i t y which h a s n o d i m e n s i o n , or a n extremity of
a line."
Criticisms by commentators.
E u c l i d ' s definition itself is of c o u r s e practically t h e s a m e as t h a t which
A r i s t o t l e ' s frequent allusions show t o h a v e b e e n t h e n current, except t h a t it
o m i t s t o say t h a t t h e p o i n t m u s t h a v e position. I s it t h e n sufficient, seeing
t h a t t h e r e a r e o t h e r t h i n g s w h i c h a r e w i t h o u t p a r t s or indivisible, e.g. t h e now
in t i m e , a n d t h e unit in n u m b e r ? P r o c l u s answers (p. 93, 18) t h a t t h e point
is t h e only t h i n g in the subject-matter 0/geometry t h a t is indivisible. Relatively
therefore t o t h e particular science t h e definition is sufficient.
Secondly, t h e
definition h a s b e e n over a n d over again criticised b e c a u s e it is purely negative.
P r o c l u s ' answer t o this is (p. 94, 10) t h a t negative descriptions a r e appropriate
t o first principles, a n d h e q u o t e s P a r m e n i d e s as having d e s c r i b e d his first a n d
last c a u s e by m e a n s of n e g a t i o n s merely. Aristotle t o o a d m i t s t h a t it m a y
s o m e t i m e s b e necessary for o n e framing a definition t o use negations, e.g. in
defining privative t e r m s s u c h as " b l i n d " ; a n d h e s e e m s t o a c c e p t as proper
