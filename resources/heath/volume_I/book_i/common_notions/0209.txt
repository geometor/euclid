POSTULATE

any

Let the following
point.

be postulated:

to draw

I.

a straight

line from

any point

to

From any point to any point.
I n g e n e r a l s t a t e m e n t s of this k i n d
t h e Greeks did n o t say, as we d o , "any p o i n t , " "any t r i a n g l e " etc., b u t
"every p o i n t , " "every t r i a n g l e " a n d t h e like. T h u s t h e w o r d s a r e h e r e
literally " f r o m every p o i n t to every p o i n t . " Similarly t h e first w o r d s of
P o s t u l a t e 3 a r e " w i t h every c e n t r e a n d d i s t a n c e , " a n d t h e e n u n c i a t i o n , e.g., of
i. 18 is " I n every triangle t h e greater side s u b t e n d s t h e greater a n g l e . "
I t will be r e m e m b e r e d that, a c c o r d i n g t o Aristotle, t h e g e o m e t e r m u s t in
general a s s u m e what a t h i n g is, or its definition, b u t m u s t p r o v e that it is,
i.e. t h e existence of t h e thing c o r r e s p o n d i n g to t h e definition : only in t h e case
of t h e two most primary things, p o i n t s a n d lines, d o e s h e a s s u m e , w i t h o u t
proof, b o t h t h e definition a n d t h e existence of t h e t h i n g defined.
Euclid has
i n d e e d n o separate a s s u m p t i o n affirming t h e existence of points s u c h as we find
nowadays in text-books like t h o s e of V e r o n e s e , I n g r a m i , E n r i q u e s , " t h e r e exist
distinct p o i n t s " or " t h e r e exist a n infinite n u m b e r of p o i n t s . " B u t , as re­
g a r d s the only lines dealt with in t h e Elements, straight lines a n d circles,
existence is asserted in P o s t u l a t e s i a n d 3 respectively. P o s t u l a t e 1 h o w e v e r
does m u c h m o r e t h a n (1) p o s t u l a t e t h e existence of straight lines. I t is
(2) a n answer to a possible o b j e c t o r w h o s h o u l d say t h a t you c a n n o t , with t h e
imperfect i n s t r u m e n t s at y o u r disposal, d r a w a m a t h e m a t i c a l straight line at all,
a n d c o n s e q u e n t l y (in t h e words of Aristotle, Anal. post. 1. 10, 76 b 41) t h a t
t h e g e o m e t e r uses false h y p o t h e s e s , since h e calls a line a foot long w h e n it is
not or straight when it is n o t straight. I t w o u l d seem (if G h e r a r d ' s translation
is right) t h a t an-Nairizi saw t h a t o n e p u r p o s e of t h e P o s t u l a t e was t o refute
this criticism : " t h e utility of t h e first t h r e e p o s t u l a t e s is (to e n s u r e ) t h a t t h e
weakness of o u r e q u i p m e n t shall n o t p r e v e n t (scientific) d e m o n s t r a t i o n "
(ed. Curtze, p . 30). T h e fact is, as Aristotle says, t h a t t h e g e o m e t e r ' s d e m o n ­
stration is n o t c o n c e r n e d with t h e p a r t i c u l a r imperfect straight line w h i c h h e
h a s drawn, b u t with t h e ideal straight line of w h i c h it is t h e imperfect
representation. Simplicius too indicates t h a t t h e object of t h e P o s t u l a t e is
r a t h e r to e n a b l e t h e drawing of a m a t h e m a t i c a l straight line t o b e imagined
t h a n to assert t h a t it can actually b e realised in p r a c t i c e : " h e w o u l d b e a
rash person who, taking t h i n g s a s t h e y actually are, s h o u l d p o s t u l a t e t h e
drawing of a straight line from A r i e s t o L i b r a . "
T h e r e is still s o m e t h i n g m o r e t h a t m u s t b e inferred from t h e P o s t u l a t e
c o m b i n e d with t h e definition of a straight line, n a m e l y (3) t h a t t h e straight
line joining two p o i n t s is unique: in o t h e r w o r d s that, if two straight
lines
("rectilineal s e g m e n t s , " as V e r o n e s e w o u l d call t h e m ) have the same
extremities,
they must coincide throughout their length.
T h e . o m i s s i o n of E u c l i d t o state
this in so m a n y words, t h o u g h h e a s s u m e s it in 1. 4, is n o d o u b t a n s w e r a b l e for
t h e interpolation in t h e text of t h e e q u i v a l e n t a s s u m p t i o n t h a t two
straight
lines cannot enclose a space, w h i c h h a s c o n s t a n t l y a p p e a r e d in MSS. a n d e d i t i o n s
of Euclid, either a m o n g A x i o m s or P o s t u l a t e s . T h a t P o s t u l a t e 1 i n c l u d e d it,
by conscious implication, is e v e n clear from P r o c l u s ' words in his n o t e o n 1. 4
(p. 239, 1 6 ) : " t h e r e f o r e two straight lines d o n o t e n c l o s e a space, a n d it was
with knowledge of this fact t h a t t h e writer of t h e E l e m e n t s said in t h e first of
his Postulates, to draw a straight line from any point to any point, i m p l y i n g
that it is one straight line which w o u l d always join t h e two p o i n t s , n o t two."
