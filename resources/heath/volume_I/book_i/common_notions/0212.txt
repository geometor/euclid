B u t t h e first a l t e r n a t i v e (a) obviously c o n t r a d i c t s t h e foregoing l e m m a [that
t w o straight lines c a n n o t enclose a s p a c e ] , since in t h a t case t h e two lines
AXK, A TK, w h i c h b y h y p o t h e s i s a r e straight, w o u l d e n c l o s e a s p a c e .
T h e s e c o n d possibility (b) is at o n c e seen t o involve a similar absurdity.
F o r t h e straight line XB m u s t , w h e n p r o d u c e d b e y o n d B, ultimately m e e t
APLM
in a p o i n t L.
C o n s e q u e n t l y t h e t w o lines AXBL,
APL, which by
h y p o t h e s i s a r e straight, would again e n c l o s e a space. If however we were t o
a s s u m e t h a t t h e straight line XB p r o d u c e d b e y o n d B will ultimately m e e t
e i t h e r t h e straight line XM or t h e straight line XA in a n o t h e r point, we should
in t h e s a m e way arrive at a c o n t r a d i c t i o n .
F r o m t h i s it obviously follows t h a t , o n t h e a s s u m p t i o n m a d e , t h e line
AXM is itself t h e straight l i n e w h i c h was d r a w n from t h e p o i n t A to t h e point
M; a n d t h a t is what was m a i n t a i n e d .
T h e r e m a i n i n g stages a r e in s u b s t a n c e these.
(ii) If the straight line A X B , regarded as rigid, revolves about A X as axis,
it cannot assume two more positions in the same plane, so that, for example, in
one position X B should coincide with X C , and in the other with X M .
[ T h i s is p r o v e d by c o n s i d e r a t i o n s of s y m m e t r y . AXB c a n n o t be altogether
" similar o r e q u a l to " AXC, if viewed from t h e s a m e side (left or right) of
b o t h : o t h e r w i s e t h e y w o u l d c o i n c i d e , w h i c h by h y p o t h e s i s t h e y d o not.
But
t h e r e is n o t h i n g t o p r e v e n t AXB viewed from o n e side (say t h e left) being
" s i m i l a r or e q u a l t o " AXC viewed from t h e o t h e r side (i.e. t h e right), so t h a t
AXB can, w i t h o u t a n y c h a n g e , b e b r o u g h t into t h e position AXC.
AXB c a n n o t h o w e v e r t a k e t h e position of t h e o t h e r straight line AXM as
well. If t h e y were like o n o n e side, t h e y would c o i n c i d e ; if t h e y were like on
o p p o s i t e sides, AXM,
AXC w o u l d b e like o n t h e s a m e s i d e a n d therefore
coincide.]
(iii) T h e o t h e r p o s i t i o n s of AXB
below t h e original p l a n e .

(iv) I t is n e x t m a i n t a i n e d t h a t there is a point D on the arc B C such that, if
X D is drawn, A X D is not only a straight line but is such that viewedfrom the left
side it is exactly "similar or equal" to what it is when vieioed from the right side.
[First, it is p r o v e d t h a t p o i n t s M, F c a n b e found on t h e a r c , c o r r e s p o n d i n g
in t h e s a m e way as B, C d o , b u t n e a r e r together, a n d of c o u r s e AXM,
AXF
a r e b o t h straight lines.
Secondly, similar c o r r e s p o n d i n g p o i n t s c a n b e found still n e a r e r together,
a n d so o n continually, until either (a) we c o m e t o one p o i n t D such t h a t
AXD
is exactly like itself when the right and left sides are compared, or (b) t h e r e a r e
two u l t i m a t e p o i n t s of t h i s sort M, F, s o t h a t both AXM,
AXF have this
property.
Thirdly, (b) is r u l e d o u t by reference t o t h e definition of a straight line.
H e n c e (a) only is t r u e , a n d t h e r e is o n l y one p o i n t D s u c h as d e s c r i b e d . ]
(v) Lastly, S a c c h e r i c o n c l u d e s t h a t t h e straight line AXD
so d e t e r m i n e d
" is alone a s t r a i g h t line, a n d t h e immediate p r o l o n g a t i o n from A b e y o n d X t o
D," relying a g a i n o n t h e definition of a straight line as " lying evenly."
S i m s o n d e d u c e d t h e p r o p o s i t i o n t h a t two straight lines cannot have a
common segment as a corollary from 1. 1 1 ; b u t his a r g u m e n t is a c o m p l e t e
petitio principii, as s h o w n by T o d h u n t e r in his n o t e o n t h a t proposition.
P r o c l u s ( p . 217, 10) r e c o r d s a n a n c i e n t proof a l s o b a s e d o n t h e proposition
