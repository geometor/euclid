( 3 ) From the existence of a single triangle in which the sum of the angles is
equal to, greater than, or less than two right angles the truth of the hypothesis
of the right angle, obtuse angle, or acute angle respectively follows.
(Prop, xv.)
T h e s e p r o p o s i t i o n s involve t h e following: If in a single triangle the sum
of the angles is equal to, greater than, or less than two right angles, then a n y
triangle has the sum of its angles equal to, greater than, or less than two right
angles respectively, which was p r o v e d a b o u t a c e n t u r y later by L e g e n d r e for
t h e t w o cases only w h e r e t h e sura is equal to or less than two right angles.

(4)
Two straight lines in a plane (even o n t h e h y p o t h e s i s of t h e a c u t e
angle) either have a common perpendicular,
or must, if produced in one and the
same direction, either intersect once at a finite distance or at least
continually
approach one another.
(Prop, x x m . )
( 5 ) In a cluster of rays issuing from a point there exist always (on t h e
h y p o t h e s i s of t h e a c u t e angle) two determinate straight lines which separate the
straight
lines which intersect a fixed straight line from those which do not
intersect it, ending with and including the straight line which has a common
perpendicular
with the fixed straight line.
