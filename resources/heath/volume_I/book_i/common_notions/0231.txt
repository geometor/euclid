If possible, let 2R + a b e t h e sum of t h e t h r e e angles of t h e triangle ABC,
of which A is n o t greater t h a n either of t h e
others.
Bisect BC at H, a n d p r o d u c e AH to D,
m a k i n g HD equal t o AH; join BD.
T h e n t h e triangles AHC, DHB
are e q u a l in
all respects (1. 4 ) ; a n d t h e angles CAH,
ACHsxe,
respectively equal t o t h e angles BDH,
DBH
I t follows t h a t t h e s u m of t h e angles of t h e
triangle ABD
is e q u a l t o t h e s u m of t h e angles of t h e original triangle, i.e.
t o 2R + a.
A n d o n e of t h e angles DAB, ADB is either e q u a l to or less t h a n half t h e
a n g l e . CA B.
C o n t i n u i n g t h e s a m e c o n s t r u c t i o n with t h e triangle ADB,
we find a t h i r d
triangle in which t h e s u m of t h e a n g l e s is still 2R + a, while o n e of t h e m is
e q u a l t o or less t h a n ( l
CAB)j^.
P r o c e e d i n g in this way, we arrive a t a triangle in w h i c h t h e s u m of t h e
angles is 2R + a, a n d o n e of t h e m is not g r e a t e r t h a n ( u
CAB)/2".
A n d , if n is sufficiently large, this will b e less t h a n a ; in w h i c h case we
s h o u l d h a v e a triangle in which two angles are t o g e t h e r greater t h a n two right
a n g l e s : which is a b s u r d .
T h e r e f o r e a is e q u a l t o or less t h a n zero.
( I t will b e n o t e d t h a t in b o t h t h e s e proofs, as in E u c l . 1. 16," it is t a k e n for
g r a n t e d t h a t a straight line is infinite in length a n d d o e s not r e t u r n i n t o itself,
which is n o t t r u e u n d e r t h e R i e m a n n hypothesis.)
I I . O n t h e a s s u m p t i o n t h a t t h e s u m of t h e an gles of a triangle is less
t h a n two right angles, if a triangle is made up of two others, the " deficit" of the
former is equal to the sum of the " deficits " of the others.
I n fact, if t h e s u m s of t h e angles of t h e c o m p o n e n t triangles a r e 2R - a,
2R-f$
respectively, t h e s u m of t h e angles of t h e whole triangle is
( 2 ^ - o ) + ( 2 ^ - | 8 ) - 2 ^ = 2 ^ - ( o + ^).
I I I . If the sum of the three angles of a triangle is e q u a l to two
right
angles, the same is true of all triangles obtained by subdividing
it by straight
lines drawn from a vertex to meet the opposite side.
Since t h e s u m of t h e angles of t h e triangle ABC is e q u a l t o 2R, if t h e
s u m of t h e angles of t h e triangle ABD were 2R - a, it
would follow t h a t t h e sum of t h e angles of t h e triangle
ADC m u s t b e 2R + a, which is a b s u r d (by I. a b o v e ) .
I V . If in a triangle the sum of the three angles is
equal to two right angles, a quadrilateral
can always be
constructed with four right angles and four equal sides
exceeding in length any assigned rectilineal segment.
