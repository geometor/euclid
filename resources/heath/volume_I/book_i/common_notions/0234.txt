There exists a triangle in which the sum of the three angles is equal to
two right angles ( L e g e n d r e ) .

( 8 ) If in a quadrilateral
three angles are right angles, the fourth angle is
a right angle also ( C l a i r a u t , 1 7 4 1 ) .
(9) If two straight lines are parallel, they are figures opposite to (or the
reflex of) one another with respect to the middle points of all their
transversal
segments ( V e r o n e s e , Elementi,
1904).
Or, Two parallel
straight lines intercept, on every transversal which passes
through the middle point of a segment included between them, another segment
the middle point of which is the middle point of the first ( I n g r a m i ,
Elementi,
1904).
