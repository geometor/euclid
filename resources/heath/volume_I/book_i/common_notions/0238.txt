If t h e y were i n t e r p o l a t e d , we s h o u l d h a v e e x p e c t e d to find t h e

I think
it q u i t e p o s s i b l e t h a t E u c l i d m a y h a v e inserted s u c h w o r d s in o n e case a n d

E u c l i d u s e d Common Notion 3 in m a k i n g his inference, h e is clearly mistaken.
F o r , while a x i o m (b) is a n o b v i o u s inference from Common Notion 2, axiom (c)
is n o t a n inference from Common Notion 3. T a n n e r y says, in a n o t e , t h a t (c)
w o u l d h a v e t o b e e s t a b l i s h e d by reduclio ad absurdum with t h e h e l p of axiom
(b), t h a t is t o say, of Common Notion 2. But, as t h e h y p o t h e s i s in t h e reductio
ad absurdum w o u l d b e t h a t o n e of t h e halves is greater t h a n t h e other, a n d it
w o u l d therefore b e necessary t o p r o v e t h a t t h e o n e whole is greater t h a n t h e
o t h e r , while a x i o m (b) or Common Notion 2 only refers t o equals, a little
a r g u m e n t w o u l d b e n e c e s s a r y in a d d i t i o n t o t h e reference t o Common Notion 2.
I t h i n k E u c l i d would n o t h a v e g o n e t h r o u g h this process in o r d e r t o p r o v e (c),
b u t w o u l d h a v e a s s u m e d it as equally o b v i o u s with (b).
P r o c l u s ( p p . 1 9 7 , 6 — 1 9 8 , 5 ) definitely rejects two o t h e r axioms of t h e
a b o v e k i n d given by P a p p u s , o b s e r v i n g t h a t , a s t h e y follow from t h e g e n u i n e
a x i o m s , t h e y a r e rightly o m i t t e d in m o s t copies, a l t h o u g h P a p p u s said that
t h e y were " o n r e c o r d " w k h t h e o t h e r s (awaroypa<£ecr0cu):

If equals be added to unequals, the difference between the wholes is equal

P r o c l u s a n d Simplicius (in an-Nairizi) give proofs of b o t h . T h e proof of
