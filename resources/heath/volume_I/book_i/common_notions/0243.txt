of its sense.

( 7 ) On any straight line r', starting from any one of its points A', and on
each side of it respectively, there exists one and only one segment congruent with a
segment A B belonging to the straight line r.
(8) Given a ray a, issuing from a point O , in any plane which contains it
and on each of the two sides of it, there exists one and only one ray b issuing
from O such that the angle ( a b ) is congruent with a given angle (a'b').
(9) If A B , B C are two consecutive segments of the same straight line r
(segments, that is, having an extremity and no other point common), and A ' B ' ,
B ' C two consecutive segments on another straight line r', and if A B = A ' B ' ,
B C 2 B ' C , then
AC=AC.
( 1 0 ) If (ab), ( b e ) are two consecutive angles in the same plane w (angles,
that is, having the vertex and one side common), and (a'b'), (b'c') two consecu­
tive angles in another plane ir', and if ( a b ) = (a'b'), ( b e ) = (b'c'), then
(ac) = (a'c).
( 1 1 ) If two triangles have two sides and the included angles
respectively
congruent, they have also their third sides congruent as well as the angles
opposite to the congruent sides respectively.
