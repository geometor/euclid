If two angles A B C , A ' B ' C are congruent with one another, their supple­

Given that the angle (h, k ) in the plane a is congruent with the angle (h', k')
in the plane a, and that \ is a half-ray in the plane a starting from the vertex
of the angle (h, k ) and lying within that angle, there always exists a half-ray V
in the second plane a, starting from the vertex of the angle (h', k') and lying
within that angle, such that
(h, 1) = (h\ V), and (k, 1) B (k', 1').
