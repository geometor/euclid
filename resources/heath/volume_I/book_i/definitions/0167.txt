DEFINITIONS.

1. A point is that which has no part.
2. A line is breadthless length.
3. T h e extremities of a line are points.
4. A straight line is a line which lies evenly with the
points on itself.
5. A surface is that which has length and breadth only.
6. T h e extremities of a surface are lines.
7. A p l a n e surface is a surface which lies evenly with
the straight lines on itself.
8. A plane a n g l e is the inclination to one another of
two lines in a plane which meet one another and do not lie in
a straight line.
9. And when the lines containing the angle are straight,
the angle is called rectilineal.
10. When a straight line set up on a straight line makes
the adjacent angles equal to one another, each of the equal
angles is right, and the straight line standing on the other is
called a perpendicular to that on which it stands.
11. A n obtuse a n g l e is an angle greater than a right
angle.
12. A n a c u t e a n g l e is an angle less than a right angle.
13. A boundary is that which is an extremity of any­
thing.
14. A figure is that which is contained by any boundary
or boundaries.
15. A circle is a plane figure contained by one line such
that all the straight lines falling upon it from one point among
those lying within the figure are equal to one another;
