16. And the point is called the centre of the circle.
17. A d i a m e t e r of the circle is any straight line drawn
through the centre and terminated in both directions by the
circumference of the circle, and such a straight line also
bisects the circle.
18. A s e m i c i r c l e is the figure contained by the diameter
and the circumference cut off by it. And the centre of the
semicircle is the same as that of the circle.
19. R e c t i l i n e a l figures are those which are contained
by straight lines, trilateral figures being those contained by
three, quadrilateral those contained by four, and multi­
lateral those contained by more than four straight lines.
20. O f trilateral figures, an equilateral triangle is that
which has its three sides equal, an i s o s c e l e s triangle that
which has two of its sides alone equal, and a scalene
t r i a n g l e that which has its three sides unequal.
21. Further, of trilateral figures, a right-angled tri­
a n g l e is that which has a right angle, an obtuse-angled
t r i a n g l e that which has an obtuse angle, and an acutea n g l e d triangle that which has its three angles acute.
22. O f quadrilateral figures, a square is that which is
both equilateral and right-angled ; an oblong that which is
right-angled but not equilateral; a r h o m b u s that which is
equilateral but not right-angled ; and a rhomboid that which
has its opposite sides and angles equal to one another but is
neither equilateral nor right-angled. And let quadrilaterals
other than these be called trapezia.
23. Parallel straight lines are straight lines which,
being in the same plane and being produced indefinitely in
both directions, do not meet one another in either direction.
POSTULATES.

Let the following be postulated :
1. T o draw a straight line from any point to any point.
2. T o produce a finite straight line continuously in a
straight line.
3. T o describe a circle with any centre and distance.
4. That all right angles are equal to one another.
