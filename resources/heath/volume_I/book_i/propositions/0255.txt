PROPOSITION

I.

On a given finite straight line to construct an equilateral
triangle.
Let AB be the given finite straight line.
Thus it is required to cons struct an equilateral triangle on
the straight line AB.
With centre A and distance
AB let the circle BCD be
described;
[Post. 3]
10 again, with centre B and dis­
tance BA let the circle ACE
be described ;
[Post. 3]
and from the point C, in which the circles cut one another, to
the points A, B let the straight lines CA, CB be joined.
[Post. 1 ]

Now, since the point A is the centre of the circle CDB,
AC\s equal to AB.
[Def. 1 5 ]
Again, since the point B is the centre of the circle CAE,
BC is equal to BA.
[Def. 1 5 ]
But CA was also proved equal to AB;
20 therefore each of the straight lines CA, CB is equal to AB.
And things which are equal to the same thing are also
equal to one another;
[C. N. 1 ]
therefore CA is also equal to CB.
Therefore the three straight lines CA, AB, BC are
25 equal to one another.
