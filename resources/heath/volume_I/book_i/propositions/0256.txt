Therefore the triangle ABC is equilateral; and it has
been constructed on the given finite straight line AB.
(Being) what it was required to do.
I. On a given finite straight line. The Greek usage differs from ours in that the
definite article is employed in such a phrase as this where we have the indefinite. M rfjt
iodtlffi)i tvdtias r€wepatrn4vijt "on the given finite straight line," i.e. the finite straight line
which we choose to take.
- 3 . Let A B be the given finite straight line. To be strictly literal we should have to
translate in the reverse order "let the given finite straight line be the (straight line) AB";
but this order is inconvenient in other cases where there is more than one datum, e.g. in the
setting-out of I. 7, "let the given point be A , and the given straight line BC," the awkward­
ness arising from the omission of the verb in the second clause. Hence I have, for clearness'
sake, adopted the other order throughout the book.
8. let the circle B C D be described. Two things are here to be noted, ( 1 ) the elegant
and practically universal use of the perfect passive imperative in constructions, yeypdtf>9u
meaning of course "let it have been described " or "suppose it described," (7) the impossi­
bility of expressing shortly in a translation the force of the words in their original order.
M>KXOS yeyp&<t>8u> i BTA means literally "let a circle have been described, the (circle, namely,
which I denote by) BCD." Similarly we have lower down " let straight lines, (namely) the
(straight lines) CA, CB, be joined," iirtftixSuaav
eiOtiai ol TA, TB. There seems to be
no practicable alternative, in English, but to translate as I have done in the text.
1 3 . from the point P.... Euclid is careful to adhere to the phraseology of Postulate 1
except that he speaks of "joining" (lTt{ti>x8wa»)
instead of " drawing {ypdQtiv).
He
does not allow himself to use the shortened expression " let the straight line PC be joined "
(without mention of the points F, C) until I. 5.
to. each of the straight lines C A , C B , inarlpa rwr TA, TB and 14. the three
straight lines C A , A B , B C , al rpelt al I'A, AB, B r . I have, here and in all similar
expressions, inserted the words "straight lines" which are not in the Greek. The possession
of the inflected definite article enables the Greek to omit the words, but this is not possible
in English, and it would scarcely be English to write "each of CA, CB" or "the three CA,
