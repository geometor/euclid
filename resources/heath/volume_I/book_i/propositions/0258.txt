PROPOSITION

2.

To place at a given point (as an extremity) a straight line
equal to a given straight line.
Let A be the given point, and BC the given straight line.
Thus it is required to place at the point A (as an extremity)
; a straight line equal to the given
straight line BC.
From the point A to the point B
let the straight line AB be joined ;
[Post 1]

and on it let the equilateral triangle
. DAB be constructed.
[1. 1 ]
Let the straight lines AE, BE be
produced in a straight line with DA,
DB;

[Post. 2]

with centre B and distance BC let the
circle CGH be described ;
[Post. 3]
and again, with centre D and distance DG let the circle GKL
be described.
[Post. 3]
Then, since the point B is the centre of the circle CGH,
BC is equal to BG.
Again, since the point D is the centre of the circle GKL,
DL is equal to DG.
And in these DA is equal to DB;
therefore the remainder AL is equal to the remainder
BG.
[CM 3 ]
But BC was also proved equal to BG;
therefore each of the straight lines AL, BC is equal
to BG.
And things which are equal to the same thing are also
equal to one another;
[CM. 1 ]
therefore AL is also equal to BC.
Therefore at the given point A the straight line AL is
placed equal to the given straight line BC.
(Being) what it was required to do.
I. (as an extremity). I have inserted these words because "to place a straight line
at a given point" (irpos rip SoOtrrt trrifieiif)) is not quite clear enough, at least in English.
I I . Let the straight lines A E , B F be produced.... It will be observed that in this
first application of Postulate 1, and again in I. 5, Euclid speaks of the continuation of the
straight line as that which is produced in such cases, tKpefJXJpQwaai' and TpofffKptp^X^ffBufftw
meaning little more than drawing straight lines " in a straight line with " the given straight
lines. The first place in which Euclid uses phraseology exactly corresponding to ours when
