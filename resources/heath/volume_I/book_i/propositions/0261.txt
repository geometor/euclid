Now, since the point A is the centre of the circle DEF,
AE is equal to AD.
[Def. is]
But C is also equal to AD.
Therefore each of the straight lines AE, C is equal to
AD ; so that AE'xs also equal to C.
[C.N. i]
Therefore, given the two straight lines AB, C, from AB
the greater AE has been cut off equal to C the less.
(Being) what it was required to do.

PROPOSITION

4.

If two triangles have the two sides equal to two sides
respectively, and have the angles contained by the equal straight
lines equal, they will also have the base equal to the base, the
triangle will be equal to the triangle, and the remaining angles
5 will be equal to the remaining angles respectively, namely those
which the equal sides subtend.
Let ABC, DEF be two triangles having the two sides
AB, AC equal to the two sides DE, DF respectively, namely
AB to DE and AC to DF, and the angle BAC equal to the
10 angle EDF.
I say that the base BC is also equal to the base EF, the
triangle ABC will be equal to the triangle DEF, and the
remaining angles will be equal to the remaining angles
respectively, namely those which the equal sides subtend, that
15 is, the angle ABC to the angle DEF, and the angle ACB
to the angle DFE.
For, if the triangle ABC be

and if the point A be placed

and the straight line AB

on DE,
then the point B will also coincide with E, because AB is
equal to DE.
