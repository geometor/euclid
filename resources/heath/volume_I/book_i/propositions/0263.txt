else, e.g. of a pedestal or column ; but -vhen, as in I. 5, two triangles were compared
occupying other than the normal positions which gave rise to the name, and when two side;
had been previously mentioned, the base was, as Proclus says, necessarily the third side.
6. subtend. itvoreLvew {nr6, " to stretch under," with accusative.
9. the angle B A C . The full Greek expression would be 17 inrb TUV BA, AR xt/Mxaiibni
yuvta, " the angle contained by the (straight lines) BA, AC." But it was a common practice
of Greek geometers, e.g. of Archimedes and Apollonius (and Euclid too in Books X.—XIII.), to
use the abbreviation oi BAT for oi BA, AL', "the (straight lines) BA, AC." Thus, on
Ttptcx°M*v being dropped, the expression would become first i) irrb run BAR ywrta, then
nfaroBAR yuvla, and finally 7)faroBAR, without ywvla, as we regularly find it in Euclid.
17. if the triangle be applied to..., 13. coincide. The difference between the
technical use of the passive itpappbietrSai " to be applied (to)," and of the active 4<pa.piit>fap
"to coincide (with) has been noticed above (note on Common Notion 4, pp. 224—5).
3a. [For if, when B coincides...36. coincide with E F ] . Heiberg (Paralipomena zu
Euklid in Hermes, XXXVIII., 1903, p. 56) has pointed out, as a conclusive reason for regarding
these words as an early interpolation, that the text of an-Nairizi (Codex Leidensis 399, 1, ed.
Besthorn-Heiberg, p. 55) does not give the words in this place but after the conclusion Q.E.D.,
which shows that they constitute a scholium only. They were doubtless added by some
commentator who thought it necessary to explain the immediate inference that, since B
coincides with E and C with F, the straight line BC coincides with the straight line EF,
an inference which really follows from the definition of a straight line and Post. 1; and no
doubt the Postulate that "Two straight lines cannot enclose a space" (afterwards placed
among the Common Notions) was interpolated at the same time.
44. Therefore etc. Where (as here) Euclid's conclusion merely repeats the enunciation
word for word, I shall avoid the repetition and write "Therefore etc." simply.
