In isosceles triangles the angles at the base are equal to one
another, and, if the equal straight lines be produced further-,
the angles under the base will be equal to one another.
Let ABC be an isosceles triangle having the side
AB
5 equal to the side AC; '
and let the straight lines BD, CE be produced further in a
straight line with AB, AC.
[Post. 2]
I say that the angle ABC is equal to the angle ACB, and
the angle CBD to the angle BCE.
10
Let a point F be taken at random
on BD;
from AE the greater let AG be cut off
equal to AF the less ;
[1. 3]
and let the straight lines FC, GB be joined.
[Post. 1 ]

is

Then, since AF

is equal to AG

and

AB to AC,
the two sides FA, AC are equal to the
two sides GA, AB, respectively ;
and they contain a common angle, the angle
FAG.
20
Therefore the base FC is equal to the base GB,
and the triangle AFC is equal to the triangle AGB,
and the remaining angles will be equal to the remaining angles
respectively, namely those which the equal sides subtend,
25

that is, the angle ACF to the angle ABG,
and the angle AFC to the angle AGB.

[1. 4]

And, since the whole AF is equal to the whole A G,
and in these AB is equal to AC,
the remainder BF is equal to the remainder CG.
But FC was also proved equal to GB;
v> therefore the two sides BF, FC are equal to the two sides
CG, GB respectively;
and the angle BFC is equal to the angle CGB,
while the base BC is common to them ;
therefore the triangle BFC is also equal to the triangle CGB,
55 and the remaining angles will be equal to the remaining
