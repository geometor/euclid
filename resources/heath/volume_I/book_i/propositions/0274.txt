Just as in i. 6 we need a Postulate to justify theoretically the statement that
CD falls within the angle ACB, so that the triangle DBC is less than the
triangle ABC, so here we need Postulates which shall satisfy us as to the
relative positions of CA, CB, CD on the one hand and of DC, DA, DB
on the other, in order that we may be able to infer that the angle BDC is
greater than the angle ADC, and the angle ACD greater than the angle BCD.
De Morgan {pp. tit. p. 7) observes that 1. 7 would be made easy to
beginners if they were first familiarised, as a common notion, with " i f two
magnitudes be equal, any magnitude greater than the one is greater than any
magnitude less than the other." I doubt however whether a beginner would
follow this easily; perhaps it would be more easily apprehended in the form
" i f any magnitude A is greater than a magnitude B, the magnitude A is
greater than any magnitude equal to B, and (a fortiori) greater than any
magnitude less than B."
It has been mentioned already (note on 1. 5 ) that the second case of I. 7
given by Simson and in our text-books generally is not in the original text
(the omission being in accordance with Euclid's general practice of giving
only one case, and that the most difficult, and leaving the others to be worked
out by the reader for himself). T h e second case is given by Proclus as the
answer to a possible objection to Euclid's proposition, which should assert that
the proposition is not proved to be universally true, since the proof given does
not cover all possible cases. Here the objector is supposed to contend that
what Euclid declares to be impossible may still be possible if one pair of lines
lie wholly within the other pair of lines; and the second part of I. 5 enables
the objection to be refuted.
If possible, let AD, DB be entirely within the triangle formed by AC,
CB with AB, and let AC be equal to AD and BC
to BD.
Join CD, and produce AC, AD to E and F.
Then, since AC is equal to AD,
the triangle ACD is isosceles,
and the angles ECD, FDC under the base are equal.
But the angle ECD is greater than the angle
BCD,
therefore the angle FDC is also greater than the angle
BCD.
Therefore the angle BDC is greater by far than the angle BCD.
Again, since DB is equal to CB,
the angles at the base of the triangle BDC are equal,
[1. 5]
that is, the angle BDC is equal to the angle BCD.
Therefore the same angle BDC is both greater than and equal to the angle
BCD: which is impossible.
T h e case in which D falls on AC or BC does not require proof.
