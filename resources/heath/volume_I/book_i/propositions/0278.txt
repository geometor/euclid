I I I . Let DF, FG form an angle exterior to the figure.
Let DG be joined.
T h e proof proceeds as in the last case,
except that subtraction takes the place of
addition, and
the remaining angle EDF is equal to the
remaining angle EGF.
Therefore in all three cases the angle
EDF is equal to the angle EGF, that is,
to the angle BA C.
It will be observed that, in accordance with the practice of the Greek
geometers in not recognising as an " angle " any angle not less than two right
angles, the re-entrant angle of the quadrilateral DEGF is ignored and the angle
DFG is said to be outside the figure.

It will be observed from the translation of this proposition that Euclid
does not say, in his description of the construction, that the equilateral triangle
should be constructed on the side of DE opposite to A; he leaves this to b e
inferred from his figure. There is no particular value in Proclus' explanation
as to how we should proceed in case any one should assert that he could not
recognise the existence of any space below DE. H e supposes, then, the
equilateral triangle described on the side of DE towards A, and hence has to
consider three cases according as the vertex o f the equilateral triangle falls
on A, above A or below it. T h e second and third cases d o not differ
