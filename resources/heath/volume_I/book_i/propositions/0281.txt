T h e property of the curve is that, if F is any point, the arc BED is

In other words, if <p is the angle FAD, 0 the radius vector AF and a the

Now the angle EAD can not only be trisected but divided in any given
ratio by means of the quadratrix (Pappus iv. p. 286).
For let FH be divided at K in the given ratio.
Draw KL parallel to AD, meeting the curve in L; join AL and produce
it to meet the circle in N.
T h e n the angles EAN, NAD are in the ratio of FK to KH, as is easily
proved.

means of the spiral of Archimedes is of course an equally simple matter.
Suppose any angle included between the two radii vectores OA and OB of the
spiral, and let it be required to cut the angle A OB in a given ratio. Since
the radius vector increases proportionally with the angle described by the
vector which generates the curve (reckoned from the original position of the
vector coinciding with the initial line to the particular position assumed), we
have only to take the radius vector OB (the greater of the two OA, OB),
mark off OC along it equal to OA, cut CB in the given ratio (at D say), and
then draw the circle with centre 0 and radius OD cutting the spiral in E.
Then OE will divide the angle A OB in the required manner.
