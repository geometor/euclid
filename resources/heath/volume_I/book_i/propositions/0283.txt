PROPOSITION 

11.

To draw a straight line at right angles to a given straight
line from a given point on it.
Let AB be the given straight line, and C the given point
on it.
5

Thus it is required to draw from the point C a straight
line at right angles to the straight
line AB.
Let a point D be taken at ran­
dom on AC;
10 let CE be made equal to CD; [1. 3]
on DE let the equilateral triangle
FDE be constructed,
[1. 1]
and let FC be joined ;
I say that the straight line FC has been drawn at right
i s angles to the given straight line AB from C the given point
on it.
For, since DC is equal to CE,
and CF is common,
2 0

the two sides DC, CF are equal to the two sides EC,
CF respectively ;
and the base DF is equal to the base FE ;
therefore the angle DCF is equal to the angle ECF;

[i- 8]
and they are adjacent angles.
But, when a straight line set up on a straight line makes
25 the adjacent angles equal to one another, each of the equal
angles is right;
[Def. 10]
therefore each of the angles DCF, FCE is right.
Therefore the straight line CF has been drawn at right
angles to the given straight line AB from the given point
30 C on it.

D e M6rgan remarks that this proposition, which is " t o bisect the angle
made by a straight line and its continuation " [i.e. a flat angle], should be a
particular case of 1. 9, the constructions being the same. This is certainly
