thus it is required to draw to the given infinite
line AB, from the given point
C which is not on it, a per­
pendicular straight line.
For let a point D be taken
at random on the other side of
the straight line AB, and with
centre C and distance CD let
the circle EFG be described ;

let the straight line EG
be bisected at H,
and let the straight lines CG, CH, CE be joined.

I say that CH has been drawn perpendicular to the given
infinite straight line AB from the given point C which is
not on it.
.
For, since GH is equal to HE,
and HC is common,
the two sides GH, HC are equal to the two sides
EH, HC respectively ;
and the base CG is equal to the base CE;
therefore the angle CHG is equal to the angle EHC.
[.. 8]

And they are adjacent angles.
But, when a straight line set up on a straight line makes
the adjacent angles equal to one another, each of the equal
angles is right, and the straight line standing on the other is
30 called a perpendicular to that on which it stands.
[Def. 10]
Therefore CH has been drawn perpendicular to the given
infinite straight line AB from the given point C which is
not on it.
