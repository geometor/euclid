that side." If it is not desired to trespass on that side of AB, we can take D
anywhere on AB and describe the arc of a circle between D and the point
where it meets AB again, drawing the arc on the side of AB on which C is.
If it should happen that the selected point D is such that the circle only meets
AB in one point (D itself), we have only to describe the circle with CD as
radius, then, if E be a point on this circle, take Fa. point further from C than
E is, and describe with CF as radius the circular arc meeting AB in two
points.

PROPOSITION

If a straight line set up on a straight line make angles, it
will make either two right angles or angles equal to two right
angles.
For let any straight line AB set up on the straight line
5 CD make the angles CBA, ABD ;
I say that the angles CBA,
ABD
are either two right angles or equal to
two right angles.
Now, if the angle CBA is equal to
10 the angle ABD,
they are two right angles.
[Def. 10]
But, if not, let BE be drawn from the point B at right
angles to CD;
(i ii]
therefore the angles CBE, EBD are two right angles.
15
Then, since the angle CBE is equal to the two angles

CBA,

20

ABE,

let the angle EBD be added to each ;
therefore the angles CBE, EBD are equal to the three
angles CBA, ABE, EBD.
[C. N. 2]
Again, since the angle DBA
is equal to the two angles

DBE,

EBA,

let the angle ABC be added to each ;
therefore the angles DBA.
ABC are equal to the three
angles DBE, EBA, ABC.
[C. M 2]
25
But the angles CBE, EBD were also proved equal to
the same three angles;
and things which are equal to the same thing are also
equal to one another ;
[C. N. 1]
therefore the angles CBE, EBD are also equal to the
30
angles DBA,
ABC.
