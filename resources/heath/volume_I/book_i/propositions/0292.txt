From this it is manifest that, if two straight

of section equal to four right angles.]

This theorem, according to Eudemus, was first discovered by Thales, but
found its scientific demonstration in Euclid (Proclus, p. 299, 3—6).
Proclus gives a converse theorem which may be stated thus. If a straight
line is met at one and the same point intermediate in its length by two other
straight lines on different sides of it and sueh as to make the vertical angles
equal, the latter straight lines are in a straight line with one another. T h e
proof need not be given, since it is almost self-evident, whether (1) it is direct,
by means of 1. 1 3 , 14, or (2) indirect, by reductio ad absurdum depending
on 1. 1 5 .
T h e balance of ms. authority seems to be against the genuineness of this
Porism, but Proclus and Psellus both have it. T h e word is not here used, as it
is in the title of Euclid's lost Porisms, to signify a particular class of independent
propositions which Proclus describes as being in some sort intermediate between
theorems and problems (requiring us, not to bring a thing into existence, but
to find something which we know to exist). Porism has here (and wherever
the term is used in the Elements) its second meaning; it is what we call a
corollaty, i.e. an incidental result springing from the proof of a theorem or the
solution of a problem, a result not directly sought but appearing as it were by
chance without any additional labour, and constituting, as Proclus says, a sort
of windfall (ipiuuov) and bonus (KCOSOS). These Porisms appear in both the
