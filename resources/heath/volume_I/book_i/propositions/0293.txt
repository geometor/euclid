geometrical and arithmetical Books of the Elements, and may either result
from theorems or problems. Here the Porism is geometrical, and springs out
of a theorem; v n . 2 affords an instance of an arithmetical Porism. A s an
instance of a Porism to a problem Proclus cites " that which is found in the
second B o o k " (TO iv rip SevWou) f)if}\up KCI/MVOV); but as to this see notes on
11. 4 and iv. 1 5 .
T h e present Porism, says Proclus, formed the basis of " that paradoxical
theorem which proves that only the following three (regular) polygons can fill
up the whole space surrounding one point, the equilateral triangle, the square,
and the equilateral and equiangular hexagon." W e can in fact place round a
point in this manner six equilateral triangles, three regular hexagons, or four
squares. " B u t only the angles of these regular figures, to the number specified,
can make up four right angles: a theorem due to the Pythagoreans."
Proclus further adds that it results from the Porism that, if any number of
straight lines intersect one another at one point, the sum of all the angles so
formed will still be equal to four right angles. This is of course what is
generally given in the text-books as Corollary 2.

In any triangle, if one of the sides be produced, the exterior
angle is greater than either of the interior and opposite angles.
Let ABC
be a triangle, and let one side of it BC be
produced to D ;
S
I say that the exterior angle ACD is greater than either
of the interior and opposite angles

CBA,

BAC.

Let A C be bisected at E [1. 10],
and let BE be joined and produced
10 in a straight line to F;
let EFbe

made equal to BE[i. 3],

let FC be joined [Post. 1], and let

AC

be drawn through to G [Post. 2].
Then, since AE

\
\Q

is equal to EC,

is and BE to EF,
EF

the two sides AE,
respectively;

EB

are equal to the two sides

and the angle AEB

is equal to the angle

EEC,

for they are vertical angles.
20

Therefore the base AB
and the triangle ABE

CE,

is equal to the base

[1. 15]
FC,

is equal to the triangle

CFE,

and the remaining angles are equal to the remaining angles
respectively, namely those which the equal sides subtend ; [1. 4]
therefore the angle BAE

is equal to the angle

ECF.
