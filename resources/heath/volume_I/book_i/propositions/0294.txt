But the angle ECD

I

is greater than the angle

[i. 16

ECF;
[C. N. 5]

therefore the angle A CD is greater than the angle

BAE.

Similarly also, if BC be bisected, the angle BCG, that is,
the angle ACD [ i . 15], can be proved greater than the angle
ABC as well.
Therefore etc.

A s is well known, this proposition is not universally true under the
Riemann hypothesis of a space endless in extent but not infinite in size. On
this hypothesis a straight line is a " closed series " and returns on itself; and
two straight lines which have one point of intersection have another point of
intersection also, which bisects the whole length of the straight line measured
from the first point on it to the same point again; thus the axiom of Euclidean
geometry that two straight lines do not enclose a space does not hold.
If 4A
denotes the finite length of a straight line measured from any point once
round to the same point again, 2 A is the distance between the two intersections
of two straight lines which meet. T w o points A, B do not determine one
sole straight line unless the distance between them is different from 2A. In
order that there may only be one perpendicular from a point C to a straight
line AB, C must not be one of the two " poles " of the straight line.
Now, in order that the proof of the present proposition may be universally
valid, it is necessary that C F should always fall within the angle A CD so that,
the angle A CF may be less than the angle A CD.
But this will not always be
so on the Riemann hypothesis. For, (1) if BE is equal to A, so that BF is
equal to 2A, F will be the second point in which BE and BD intersect; i.e.
F w i l l lie on CD, and the angle ACF will be equal to the angle ACD.
In
this case the exterior angle ACD will be equal to the interior angle BAC.
(2) If BE is greater than A and less than 2A, so that BF is greater than 2A
and less than 4A, the angle A CF will be greater than the angle A CD, and
therefore the angle A CD will be less than the interior angle BAC.
Thus, e.g.,
in the particular case of a right-angled triangle, the angles other than the right
angle may be (1) both acute, (2) one acute and one obtuse, or (3) both obtuse
according as the perpendicular sides are (1) both less than A, (2) one less and
the other greater than A, (3) both greater than A.
Proclus tells us (p. 307, 1 — 1 2 ) that some combined this theorem with the
next in one enunciation thus: In any triangle, if one side be produced, the
exterior angle of the triangle is greater than either of the in/erior and opposite
angles, and any two of the interior angles are less than two right angles, the
combination having been suggested by the similar enunciation of Euclid 1. 32,
In any triangle, if one of the sides be produced, the exterior angle is equal to the
two interior and opposite angles, and the three interior angles of the triangle are
equal to two right angles.
T h e present proposition enables Proclus to prove what he did not succeed
in establishing conclusively in his note on 1. 12, namely that from one pointthere cannot be drawn to the same straight line three straight lines equal in length.
