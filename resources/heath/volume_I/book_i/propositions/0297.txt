PROPOSITION

18.

In any triangle the greater side subtends the greater angle.
For let ABC be a triangle having the side AC greater
than AB;
I say that the angle ABC is also greater than the angle

BCA.
For, since AC is greater than AB,
to AB [1. 3], and let BD be joined.
Then, since the angle ADB
is an exterior angle of the triangle

let AD

be made equal

BCD,
it is greater than the interior
and opposite angle DCB.
[1. 16]
But the angle ADB is equal
to the angle
ABD,
since the side AB is equal to
therefore the angle ABD

AD;

is also greater than the angle

ACB;
therefore the angle ABC

is much greater than the angle

ACB.
Therefore etc.

" I n order to assist the student in remembering which of these two
propositions [1. 18, 19] is demonstrated directly and
which indirectly, it may be observed that the order is
similar to that in 1. 5 and 1. 6 " (Todhunter).
A n alternative proof of 1. 18 given by Porpnyry
(see Proclus, pp. 315, 1 1 — 3 1 6 , 13) is interesting. It
starts by supposing a length equal to AB cut off from
the other end of AC; that is, CD and not AD is
made equal to AB.
Produce AB to E so that BE is equal to AD, and
join EC.
Then, since AB is equal to CD, and BE to AD,
AE is equal to AC.
