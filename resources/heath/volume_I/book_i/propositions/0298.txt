[i. r8, 19

Therefore the angle AEC is equal to the angle ACE.
Now the angle ABC is greater than the angle AEC,
[1. 16]
and therefore greater than the angle A CE
Hence, a fortiori, the angle ABC is greater than the angle ACB.

PROPOSITION 

19.

In any triangle the greater angle is subtended by the
greater side.
Let ABC
be a triangle having the angle ABC
than the angle BCA ;
I say that the side AC

is not equal to A B ;

for then the angle ABC

it was proved that it is not equal either.
Therefore AC

Q. E. D.

This proposition, like 1. 6, can be proved by merely logical deduction from
i. 5 and 1. 18 taken together, as pointed out by D e Morgan. T h e general
form of the argument used by D e Morgan is given in his Formal Logic(i84'j),
p. 25, t h u s :
"Hypothesis. L e t there be any number of propositions or assertions—
three for instance, X, Y and Z—oi which it is the property that one or the
other must b e true, and one only. L e t there be three other propositions
P, Q and R of which it is also the property that one, and one only, must be
true. L e t it be a connexion of those assertions that:
when X is true, P is true,
when K i s true, Q is true,
when Z is true, R is true.
Consequence: then it follows that,
when P is true, X is true,
when Q is true, Y is true,
when R is true, Z is true."
