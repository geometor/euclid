P r o o f of I . 1 9 .
L e t ABC be a triangle in which the angle ABC is greater than the angle
ACB.
Bisect BC at D, join AD, and produce it to E so that DE is equal to
AD.
Join A E .
T h e n the iwo sides BD, DE are equal to the two
sides CD, DA, and the vertical angles at D are equal;
therefore BE is equal Xa AC,
and the angle DBE to the angle at C.
But the angle at C is less than the angle ABC;
therefore the angle DBE is less than the angle
ABD.
Hence, if BF bisect the angle ABE, BF meets
AE between A and D. Therefore EF is greater
than FA.
It follows, by the lemma, that BE is greater than
BA,
that is, AC is greater than AB.

PROPOSITION

20.

In any triangle two sides taken together in any manner
are greater than the remaining one.
For let ABC be a triangle ;
I say that in the triangle ABC two sides taken together in
any manner are greater than the remaining one, namely
BA, AC greater than BC,
AB, BC greaier than AC,
BC, CA greater than AB.
For let BA be drawn through to the point D,
let DA be made equal to CA, and let DC be
joined.
Then, since DA is equal to AC,
the angle ADC
is also equal to the angle

ACD;

[1. 5]

therefore the angle BCD is greater than
the angle ADC.
[C. N. 5]
And, since DCB is a triangle having the angle BCD
greater than the angle BDC,
and the greater angle is subtended by the greater side,
[.. 19]

therefore DB is greater than BC.
