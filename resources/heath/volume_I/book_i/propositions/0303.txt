PROPOSITION 

21.

If on one of the sides of a triangle, from its extremities,
there be constructed two straight lines meeting within the
triangle, the straight lines so constructed will be less than the
remaining two sides of the triangle, but will contain a greater
s angle.
On BC, one of the sides of the triangle ABC, from its
extremities B, C, let the two straight lines BD, DC be con­
structed meeting within the triangle ;
I say that BD, DC are less than the remaining two sides
10 of the triangle BA, A C, but contain an angle BDC greater
than the angle BAC.
For let BD be drawn through to E.
Then, since in any triangle two
sides are greater than the remaining
15 one,
[1. 20]
therefore, in the triangle ABE, the
two sides B,AE are greater than BE.
Let EC be added to each ;
therefore BA, A C are greater than BE, EC.
20
Again, since, in the triangle CED,
the two sides CE, ED are greater than CD,
let DB be added to each ;

25

therefore CE, EB are greater than CD, DB.
But BA, AC were proved greater than BE, EC;
therefore BA, AC are much greater than BD, DC.

Again, since in any triangle the exterior angle is greater
than the interior and opposite angle,
[1. 16]
therefore, in the triangle CDE,
the exterior angle BDC is greater than the angle CED.
30
For the same reason, moreover, in the triangle ABE also,
the exterior angle CEB is greater than the angle BAC.
But the angle BDC was proved greater than the angle CEB;
therefore the angle BDC is much greater than the angle

BAC.

Therefore etc.
