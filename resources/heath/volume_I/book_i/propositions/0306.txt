Therefore AE is greater than AD.
(2) Since AE, A'E are drawn to E, a point within the triangle AEA',
AE, FA' are together greater than AE, EA',
[1. 21]
or twice AF is greater than twice AE..
Therefore AFis greater than AE.
(3) A l o n g DB measure off DG equal to DF, and join AG.
T h e triangles AGD, AED are then equal in all respects, so that the
angles GAD, FAD are equal, and AG is equal to AF.

Out of three straight lines, which are equal to three given
straight lines, to construct a triangle: thus it is necessary that
two of the straight lines taken together in any manner should
be greater than the remaining one.
[1. 20]
Let the three given straight lines be A, B, C, and of these
let two taken together in any manner be greater than the
remaining one,
namely
A, B greater than C,
A, C greater than B,
and
B, C greater than A ;
thus it is required to construct a triangle out of straight lines
equal to A, B, C.

Let there be set out a straight line DB, terminated at D
but of infinite length in the direction of E,
and let DF be made equal to A, FG equal to B, and GH
equal to C.
[1. 3]
With centre F and distance FD let the circle DKL
be
described ;
again, with centre G and distance GH let the circle KLH
be
described ;
and let KF, KG be joined ;
I say that the triangle KFG has been constructed out of
three straight lines equal to A, B, C.
