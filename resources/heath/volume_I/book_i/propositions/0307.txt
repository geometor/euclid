It was early observed that Euclid assumes, without giving any reason, that
the circles drawn as described will meet if the condition that any two of the
straight lines A, B, C are together greater than the third be fulfilled. Proclus
(P- 3 3 8 sqq.) argues the matter by means of reductio ad absurdum, but
does not exhaust the possible hypotheses inconsistent with the contention.
H e says the circles must do one of three things, (1) cut one another, (2) touch
one another, (3) stand apart (oWrarat) from one another. H e then considers
the hypotheses (a) of their touching externally, (b) of their being separated
from one another by a space. H e should have considered also the hypothesis
(c) of one circle touching the other internally or lying entirely within the
other without touching. These three hypotheses being successively disproved,
it follows that the circles must meet (this is the line taken by Camerer and
Todhunter).
Simson says: " Some authors blame Euclid because he does not
demonstrate that the two circles made use o f in the construction of this
problem must cut one another: but this is very pla in from the determination
he has given, namely, that any two of the straight lines DF, FG, GH must
be greater than the third. For who is so dull, though only beginning to
learn the Elements, as not to perceive that the circle described from the
centre F, at the distance FD, must meet FH betwixt F and H, because FD
is less than FH; and that, for the like reason, the circle described from the
