Then, since AB is equal to DE, and AC to
the two sides Z?^4, AC are equal to the two sides ED,
respectively;
and the angle BA C is equal to the angle EDG

DG,

;

therefore the base BC is equal to the base EG.
Again, since DF

is equal to

the angle DGF

[1. 4]

DG,

is also equal to the angle DFG;

therefore the angle DFG

is greater than the angle

Therefore the angle EFG

[1. 5]
EGF.

is much greater than the angle

EGF.
And, since EFG
is a triangle having the angle
EFG
30 greater than the angle
EGF,
and the greater angle is subtended by the greater side,
[1. 19]
the side EG
But EG

is also greater than

EF.

is equal to BC.

Therefore BC is also greater than
Therefore etc.

EF.

Q. E. D.

10. I have naturally left out the well-known words added by Simson in
order to avoid the necessity of considering three cases : " O f the two sides
DE, DF let DE be the side which is not greater than the other." I doubt
whether Euclid could have been induced to insert the words himself, even if
it had been represented to him that their omission meant leaving two possible
cases out of consideration. H i s habit and that of the great Greek geometers
was, not to set out all possible cases, but to give as a rule one case, generally
the most difficult, as here, and to leave the others to the reader to work out for
himself. W e have already seen one instance in I. 7.
Proclus of course gives the other
two cases which arise if we d o not
first provide that DE is not greater
than DF.
(1) In the first case G may fall
on EF produced, and it is then
obvious that EG is greater than EF.
(2) In the second case EG may
fall below EF.
If so, by 1. 21, DF, EE are
together less than DG, GE.
But DF is equal to DG ; there­
fore EE is less than EG, i.e. than
BC.
These two cases are therefore
decidedly simpler than the case taken
by Euclid as typical, and could well be left to the ingenuity of the learner.
If however after all we prefer to insert Simson's words and avoid the latter
