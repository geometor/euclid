are proved equal, (2) if greater than two right angles, that triangle which has
the greater angle is less, and (3) if they are less, greater." Proclus then gives
the proof, but without any reference to the source from which he quoted
the proposition. Now an-Nairizi adds a similar proposition to 1. 38, but
definitely attributes it to Heron. I shall accordingly give it in the place
where Heron put it

PROPOSITION

25.

If two triangles have the two sides equal to two sides
respectively, but have the base greater than the base, they will
also have the one of the angles contained by the equal straight
lines greater than the other.
Let ABC, DEF
be two triangles having the two sides
AB, AC equal to the two sides DE, DF respectively, namely
AB to DE, and AC to DF; and let the base BC be greater
than the base EF;
I say that the angle BAC

is also greater than the angle

EDF.

For, if not, it is either equal to it or less.
Now the angle BAC is not equal to the angle
EDF;
for then the base BC would also have been equal to the base

EF,

"

[1.4]

but it is not;
therefore the angle BA C is not equal to the angle EDF.
Neither again is the angle BA C less than the angle EDF;
for then the base BC would also have been less than the base
EF,

[1.24]

but it is not;
therefore the angle BA C is not less than the angle
But it was proved that it is not equal either ;
therefore the angle BA C is greater than the angle
Therefore etc.
