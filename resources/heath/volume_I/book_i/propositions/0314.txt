D e Morgan points out that this proposition (as also i. 8) is a purely logical
consequence of i. 4 and 1. 24 in the same way as 1. 19 and 1. 6 are purely
logical consequences of 1. 18 and I. 5. I f d, b, c denote the sides, A, B, C the
angles opposite to them in a triangle ABC, and a', b', c , A', B, C the sides
and opposite angles respectively in a triangle A'B'C, 1. 4 and 1. 24 tell us
that, b, c being respectively equal to b', J,
(1) if A is equal to A', then a is equal to a',
(2) if A is less than A', then a is less than a',
(3) if A is greater than A', then a is greater than a';
and it follows logically that,
(1) if a is equal to a, the angle A is equal to the angle A',
[1. 8]
(2) if a is less than a', A is less than A',
\
(3) if a is greater than a', A is greater than A'. )

T w o alternative proofs of this theorem are given by Proclus (pp. 345—7),
and they are both interesting. Moreover both are direct.
I . Proof b y M e n e l a u s of A l e x a n d r i a .
Let ABC, DEF be two triangles having the two sides BA, AC equal to
the two sides ED, DF, but the base BC greater than the base EF.

T h e n shall the angle at A be greater than the angle at D.
From BC c u t off BG equal to EF. A t B, on the straight line BC, make
the angle GBH (on the side of BG remote from A) equal to the angle FED.
M a k e BH equal to DE; join HG, and produce it to meet AC in AT.
]6YL\AH.

T h e n , since the two sides GB, BH are equal to the two sides EE, ED
respectively,
and the angles contained by them are equal,
HG is equal to DE or AC,
and the angle BHG is equal to the angle EDF.
Now HK is greater than HG or A C,
and a fortiori greater than AK;
therefore the angle KAH is greater than the angle KHA.
A n d , since AB is equal to BH,
the angle BAH is equal to the angle BHA.
Therefore, by addition,
the whole angle BA C is greater than the whole angle BHG,
that is, greater than the angle EDF.
