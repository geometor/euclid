I I . H e r o n ' s proof.
Let the triangles be given as before.
Since BC is greater than EF, produce EF to G so that EG is equal to
EC.
Produce ED to H so that DH is equal to DF. T h e circle with centre
D and radius DFyfth then pass through H. L e t it b e described, as FKH.

Now, since BA, AC are together greater than BC,
and BA, AC axe equal to ED, DH respectively,
while BC is equal to EG,
EH is greater than EG.
Therefore the circle with centre £ a n d radius EG will cut EH, and
therefore will cut the circle already drawn. L e t it cut that circle in K, and
join DK, KE.
Then, since D is the centre of the circle FKH,
DK'\% equal to DFot AC.
Similarly, since E is the centre of the circle KG,
EK is equal to EG or BC,
A n d DE is equal to AB.
Therefore the two sides BA, AC are equal to the two sides ED, DK
respectively;
and the base BC is equal to the base EK;
therefore the angle BA C is equal to the angle EDK.
Therefore the angle BA C is greater than the angle EDF.

PROPOSITION 

26.

If two triangles have the two angles equal to two angles
respectively, and one side equal to one side, namely, either the
side adjoining the equal angles, or that subtending one of the
equal angles, they will also have the remaining
sides equal to
5 the remaining sides and the remaining angle to the
remaining
angle.
