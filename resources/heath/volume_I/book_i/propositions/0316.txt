Let ABC, DEF be two triangles having the two angles
ABC,BCA
equal to the two angles DEF, EFD respectively,
namely the angle ABC
to the angle DEF, and the angle
BCA to the angle EFD;
and let them also have one side
equal to one side, first that adjoining the equal angles, namely

BC

to

EF;

I say that they will also have the remaining sides equal
to the remaining sides respectively, namely AB to DE and
'S AC to DF, and the remaining angle to the remaining angle,
namely the angle BAC to the angle EDF.

For, if AB is unequal to DE, one of them is greater.
Let AB be greater, and let BG be made equal to DE;
and let GC be joined.
20

Then, since BG is equal to DE, and BC to EF,
the two sides GB, BC are equal to the two sides DE,
EF
respectively;
and the angle GBC is equal to the angle
DEF;
therefore the base GC is equal to the base DF,
25
and the triangle GBC is equal to the triangle DEF,
and the remaining angles will be equal to the remaining angles,
namely those which the equal sides subtend ;
[i. 4]
therefore the angle GCB is equal to the angle DFE.
But the angle DFE is by hypothesis equal to the angle BCA;
30
therefore the angle BCG is equal to the angle BCA,
the less to the greater: which is impossible.
Therefore AB is not unequal to DE,
and is therefore equal to it.
But BC is also equal to EF;
35
therefore the two sides AB, BC are equal to the two
sides DE, EF respectively,
and the angle ABC is equal to the angle
DEF;
therefore the base A C is equal to the base DF,
and the remaining angle BAC is equal to the remaining
40 angle EDF.
