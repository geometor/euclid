Again, let sides subtending equal angles be equal, as

AB

DE;

I say again that the remaining sides will be equal to the
remaining sides, namely AC to DF and BC to EF, and
45 further the remaining angle BAC
is equal to the remaining
angle EDF.
For, if BC is unequal to EF, one of them is greater.
Let BC be greater, if possible, and let BH be made equal
to EF; let AH be joined.
50
Then, since BH is equal to EF, and AB to DE,
the two sides AB, BH are equal to the two sides DE,
EF
respectively, and they contain equal angles;
therefore the base AH is equal to the base DF,
and the triangle ABH
is equal to the triangle DEF,
55 and the remaining angles will be equal to the remaining angles,
namely those which the equal sides subtend ;
[1. 4]
therefore the angle BHA
is equal to the angle EFD.
But the angle EFD is equal to the angle BCA ;
therefore, in the triangle AHC, the exterior angle BHA
is
60 equal to the interior and opposite angle BCA :
which is impossible.
Therefore BC is not unequal to

[1. 16]

EF,

and is therefore equal to it.
But AB

is also equal to DE ;

65 therefore the two sides AB,
DE,

EF

BC

are equal to the two sides

respectively, and they contain equal angles ;

therefore the base A C is equal to the base
the triangle ABC

equal to the triangle

and the remaining angle BAC
70 EDF.

DF,

DEF,

equal to the remaining angle
[1.4]

Therefore etc.

the side adjoining the equal angles, Tr\tvpiu>riprp6s rah bats ywvlau.

inrtucufxai is used for the passive of i/rortdttiu, as Keificu is used for the passive of rlBy/it, and
so with the other compounds. Cf. trpoaKuadai,
" to be added."
T h e alternative method of proving this proposition, viz. by applying one
triangle to the other, was very early discovered, at least so far as regards the
case where the equal sides are adjacent to the equal angles in each. An-NairizI
gives it for this case, observing that the proof is one which he had found, but
of which he did not know the author.
