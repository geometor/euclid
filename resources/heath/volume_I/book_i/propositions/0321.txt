therefore the triangles ABC, DEG are equal in all respects, [1. 26]
so that the side A C is equal to the side DG,
and the angle A CB is equal to the angle DGE.
Again, since AC is equal to DFas well as to DG,
DEis equal to DG,
and therefore the angles DEG, DGE axe, equal.
But the angle DFE is supplementary to the angle DFG; and the angle
DGF was proved equal to the angle- A CB;
therefore the angle DFE is supplementary to the angle A CB.
If it is desired to avoid the ambiguity and secure that the triangles may
be congruent, we can introduce the necessary conditions into the enunciation,
on the analogy of Eucl. vi. 7.
If two triangles have two sides of the one equal to two sides of the other
respectively, and the angles opposite to a pair of equal sides equal, then, if the
angles opposite to the oilier pair of equal sides are both acute, or both obtuse, or if
one of them is a right angle, the two triangles are equal in all respects.
T h e proof of the three cases (by reductio ad absurdum) was given by
Todhunter.

PROPOSITION 

27.

If a straight
line falling
on two straight
lines make the
alternate angles equal to one another, the straight lines will be
parallel
to one another.
For let the straight line EF falling on the two straight
s lines AB, CD make the alternate angles AEF,
EFD equal
to one another;
I say that AB is parallel to CD.
For, if not, AB, CD when produced will meet either in the direction
10 of B, D or towards A, C.
Let them be produced and meet,
in the direction of B, D, at G.
Then, in the triangle GEF,

the exterior angle A EF is equal to the interior and opposite
is angle EFG:
which is impossible.

[1. 16]

Therefore AB, CD when produced will not meet in the
direction of B, D.
Similarly it can be proved that neither will they meet
20 towards A, C.
