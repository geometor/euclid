For let the straight line EF falling on the two straight
lines AB,
CD make the exterior angle EGB equal to the
interior and opposite angle GHD, or the interior angles on
the same side, namely BGH, GHD, equal to two right angles;
I say that AB is parallel to CD.
For, since the angle EGB
is
equal to the angle GHD,
while the angle EGB is equal to the
angle AGH,
[1. 15]
the angle A GH is also equal to the
angle GHD;

and they are alternate ;
therefore AB

is parallel to CD.

[1. 27]

Again, since the angles BGH,
GHD are equal to two
right angles, and the angles AGH,
BGH
are also equal to
two right angles,
[1. 13]
the angles A GH, BGH are equal to the angles BGH,
GHD.
Let the angle BGH

be subtracted from each ;

therefore the remaining angle AGH
angle

is equal to the remaining

GHD;

and they are alternate;
therefore AB

is parallel to CD.

[1. 27]

Therefore etc.

Q. E. D.

One criterion of parallelism, the equality of alternate angles, is given in
1. 2 7 ; here we have two more, each of which is easily reducible, and is actually
reduced, to the other.
Proclus observes (pp. 358—9) that Euclid could have stated six criteria as
well as three, by using, in addition, other pairs of angles
in the figure (not adjacent) of which it could be predi­
cated that the two angles are equal or that their sum
is equal to two right angles. A natural division is to
consider, first the pairs which are on the same side of
the transversal, and secondly the pairs which are on
different sides of it.
Taking (1) the possible pairs on the same side, we
may have a pair consisting of
(a) two internal angles,
GHD) and (A GH, GHC);

viz. the pairs

(BGH,

(6) two external angles, viz. the pairs (EGB, DHE) and (EGA, CHE);
(c) one external and one internal angle, viz. the pairs (EGB, GHD),
(FHD, HGB), (EGA, GHC) and (EHC, HGA).
