But the angles A GH, BGH

are equal to two right angles;
[i- 13]
therefore the angles BGH,
GHD
are less than two
right angles.
But straight lines produced indefinitely from angles less
than two right angles meet;

25

therefore AB,

[Post. 5]

CD, if produced indefinitely, will meet;

but they do not meet, because they are by hypothesis parallel.
Therefore the angle AGH

is not unequal to the angle

GHD,
30

and is therefore equal to it.
Again, the angle AGH
is equal to the angle EGB;
[1. 15]
therefore the angle EGB
is also equal to the angle
GHD.
[CN.i]
Let the angle BGH

be added to each ;

therefore the angles EGB,
BGH
are equal to the
35 angles BGH, GHD.

But the angles EGB, BGH are equal to two right angles ;

therefore the angles BGH,
GHD are also equal to

straight lines begin from points at which they meet a transversal, and make with it internal
angles on the same side the sum of which is less than two right angles.

If, instead of Postulate 5, it is preferred to use " Playfair's " axiom in the
proof o f this proposition, we proceed thus.
T o prove that the alternate angles AGH,

GHD are equal.
A
g
If they are not equal, draw another straight
K
\
line KL through G making the angle KGH
0
equal to the angle GHD.
\ '
Then, since the angles KGH, GHD are equal,
KL is parallel to CD.
[1. 27]
C

Therefore two straight lines K L , A B intersecting at G are both parallel to
the straight line C D :
which is impossible (by the axiom).
Therefore the angle A GH cannot but be equal to the angle GHD.
T h e rest of the proposition follows as in Euclid.
