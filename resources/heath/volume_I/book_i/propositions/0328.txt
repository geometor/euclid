(a). For anything we know to the contrary, class (/8) may be greater than
class (a). Hence, if you assert anything of class (/3), the logical effect is more
extensive than if you assert it of class ( a ) ; for you assert it, not only of that
portion of class (J3) which is known to be included in class (a), but also of the
unknown (but possibly existing) portion which is not so included.
(2) Euclid's Postulate puts before the beginner clear and positive con­
ceptions, a pair of straight lines, a transversal, and two angles together less
than two right angles, whereas " Playfair's" axiom requires him to realise a
pair of straight lines which never meet though produced to infinity: a negative
conception which does not convey to the mind any clear notion of the relative
position of the lines. A n d (p. 68) Euclid's Postulate gives a direct criterion
for judging that two straight lines meet, a criterion which is constantly required,
e.g. in 1. 44. It is true that the Postulate can be deduced from " Playfair's "
axiom, but editors frequently omit to deduce it, and then tacitly assume it
afterwards: which is the least justifiable course of all.

10. The usual conclusion in general terms ("Therefore etc.") repeating the enunciation
is, curiously enough, wanting at the end of this proposition.

T h e proposition is, as D e Morgan points out, the logical equivalent of
"Playfair's" axiom. Thus, if X denote "pairs of straight lines intersecting one
