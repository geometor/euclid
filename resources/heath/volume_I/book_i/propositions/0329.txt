another," Y" pairs of straight lines parallel to one and the same straight line,"
we have
N o X is Y,
and it follows logically that
N o Y is X.
De Morgan adds that a proposition is much wanted about parallels (or
perpendiculars) to two straight lines respectively making the same angles with
one another as the latter do. T h e proposition may be enunciated thus :
If the sides of one angle be respectively (1) parallel or (2) perpendicular to
the sides of another angle, the two angles are either
equal or supplementary.
(1) Let DE be parallel to AB and GEE parallel
to BC.
T o prove that the angles ABC, DEG are equal
and the angles ABC, DEE supplementary.
Produce DE to meet BC in H.
Then [1. 29] the angle DEG is equal to the angle
DHC,
and the angle ABC is equal to the angle DHC.
Therefore the angle DEG is equal to the angle ABC; whence also the
angle DEF is supplementary to the angle ABC.
(2) Let ED be perpendicular to AB, and GEE perpendicular to BC.
T o prove that the angles ABC, DEG are
equal, and the angles ABC, DEF supplementary.
D'
Draw ED' at right angles to ED on the side
G /
of it opposite to B, and draw EG' at right angles
to EF on the side of it opposite to B.
/
Then, since the angles BDE, DED, being
E
Q'
right angles, are equal,
ED

is parallel to BA.

[1. 27]

Similarly EG' is parallel to BC.
Therefore [Part (1)] the angle D'EG' is equal to the angle ABC.
But, the right angle DED being equal to the right angle GEG', if the
common angle GED be subtracted,
the angle DEG is equal to the angle D'EG.
Therefore the angle DEG is equal to the angle ABC; and hence the
angle DEF is supplementary to the angle ABC.
