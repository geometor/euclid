fi. 31, 32

Let a point D be taken at random on BC, and let AD be
joined ; on the straight line
DA,
and at the point A on it, let the
^
£
angle DAE
be constructed equal
/
to the angle ADC [1. 2 3 ] ; and let the
/
straight line AF be produced in a
I
D
C
straight line with
EA.
Then, since the straight line AD
falling on the two
straight lines BC, EF has made the alternate angles
EAD,
ADC
equal to one another,
F

therefore EAF
EAF

is parallel to BC.

[1. 27]

Therefore through the given point A the straight line
has been drawn parallel to the given straight line BC.

Q. E. F.

Proclus rightly remarks (p. 376, 14—20) that, as it is implied in 1. 12
that only one perpendicular can be drawn to a straight line from an external
point, so here it is implied that only one straight line can be drawn through a
point parallel to a given straight line. T h e construction, be it observed,
depends only upon 1. 27, and might therefore have come directly after that
proposition. Why then did Euclid postpone it until after 1. 29 and 1. 30?
Presumably because he considered it necessary, before giving the construction,
to place beyond all doubt the fact that only one such parallel can be drawn.
Proclus infers this fact from 1. 3 0 ; for, he says, if two straight lines could be
drawn through one and the same point parallel to the same straight line, the two
straight lines would be parallel, though intersecting at the given point: which
is impossible. I think it is a fair inference that Euclid would have considered
it necessary to justify the assumption that only one parallel can be drawn
by some such argument, and that he deliberately determined that his own
assumption was more appropriate to be made the subject of a Postulate
than the assumption of the uniqueness of the parallel.

PROPOSITION 

32.

In any triangle, if one of the sides be produced, the exterior
angle is equal to the two interior
and opposite angles, and the
three interior
angles of the triangle
are equal to two right
angles.
Let ABC
be a triangle, and let one side of it BC
produced to D;

be

1 say that the exterior angle ACD
is equal to the two
interior and opposite angles CAB,
ABC,
and the three
interior angles of the triangle ABC, BCA, CAB are equal
to two right angles.
