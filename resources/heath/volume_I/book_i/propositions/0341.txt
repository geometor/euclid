i i . F D C . The text has " DFC."
M, L e t D G E be subtracted. Euclid speaks of the triangle DGE without any
explanation that, in the case which he takes (where AD, EF have no point in common),
BE, CD must meet at a point G between the two parallels. He allows this to appear from
the figure simply.

E q u a l i t y in a n e w sense.
It is important to observe that we are in this proposition introduced for
the first time to a new conception of equality between .figures. Hitherto we
have had equality in the sense of congruence only, as applied to straight lines,
angles, and even triangles (cf. 1. 4). Now, without any explicit reference to
any change in the meaning of the term, figures are inferred to be equal which
are equal in area or in content but need not be of the same form. N o
definition of equality is anywhere given by E u c l i d ; we are left to infer its
meaning from the few axioms about " equal things." It will be observed that
in the above proof the " equality " of two parallelograms on the same base
and between the same parallels is inferred by the successive steps ( 1 ) o f
subtracting one and the same area (the triangle DGE) from two areas equal
in the sense of congruence (the triangles AEB, DEC), and inferring that the
remainders (the trapezia ABGD, EGCF) are " e q u a l " ; (2) of adding one and
