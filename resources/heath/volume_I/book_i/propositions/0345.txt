36.

Parallelograms
which are on equal
parallels are equal to one another.

Let ABCD,
EFGH
be parallelograms which are on
equal bases BC, FG and in the same parallels AH,

I say that the parallelogram ABCD
is equal to
For let BE, CH be joined.
Then, since BC is equal to FG
while

FG is equal to
BC

EFGH.

EH,

is also equal to EH.

[C. N. 1 ]

But they are also parallel.
And EB, HC join them ;
but straight lines joining equal and parallel straight lines (at
the extremities which are) in the same directions (respectively)
are equal and parallel.
[1. 33]
Therefore EBCH

is a parallelogram.

And it is equal to ABCD

[1. 35]

the same reason also EFGH

is equal to the same

EBCH;
so that the parallelogram ABCD
