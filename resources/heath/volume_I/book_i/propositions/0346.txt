37.

Triangles
which are on the same
parallels
are equal to one another.
Let ABC,

Moreover the triangle ABC
is half of the parallelogram
EBCA
; for the diameter AB bisects it.
[i. 34]
And the triangle DBC is half of the parallelogram
DBCF;
20 for the diameter DC bisects it.
[1. 34]
[But the halves of equal things are equal to one another.]
Therefore the triangle ABC is equal to the triangle DBC.
Therefore etc.

Q. E. D.

II. Here and in the next proposition Heiberg brackets the words "But the halves of
equal things are equal to one another" on the ground that, since the Common Notion
which asserted this fact was interpolated at a very early date (before the time of Theon),
it is probable that the words here were interpolated at the same time. Cf. note above
(p. 224) on the interpolated Common Notion.
There is a lacuna in the text of Proclus' notes to I. 36 and I. 37.
Apparently the end of the former and the beginning of the latter are missing,
the MSS. and the editio princeps showing no separate note for I. 37 and no
lacuna, but going straight on without regard to sense. Proclus had evidently
remarked again in the missing passage that, in the case of both parallelograms
and triangles between the same parallels, the two sides which stretch from one
parallel to the other may increase in length to any extent, while the area
remains the same. T h u s the perimeter in parallelograms or triangles is of
itself no criterion as to their area. Misconception on this subject was rife
among non-mathematicians; and Proclus (p. 403, 5 sqq.) tells us ( 1 ) of
describers of countries (xn>poypa<poi) who drew conclusions regarding the size
of cities from their perimeters, and (2) of certain members of communistic
