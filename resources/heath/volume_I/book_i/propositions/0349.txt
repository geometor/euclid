Then, since the angles BAC, EDF axe equal to two right angles, the
angles EDH, EDF axe equal to two right angles.
But so are the angles EDH,
DHF.
Therefore the angles EDF, DHF are equal.
A n d the alternate angles EDF, DFH are equal.
[1. 29]
Therefore the angles DHF, DFH are equal,
and DF is equal to DH.
[1. 6]
Hence the two sides ED, DH are equal to the two sides BA, AC; and
the included angles are equal.
Therefore the triangles ABC, DEH are equal in all respects.
A n d the triangles DEE, DEH between the same parallels are equal.
37]
Therefore the triangles ABC, DEF are equal.
[Proclus takes the construction of Eucl. 1. 24, i.e., he makes DH equal to
DF and then proves that ED, EH are parallel.]
(2) Suppose the angles BAC, EDF together less than two right angles.
As before, make the angle EDG equal to the angle BAC, draw EH
parallel to ED, and join EH.

In this case the angles EDH, EDF are together less than two right
angles, while the angles EDH, DHF are equal to two right angles.
[1. 29]
Hence the angle EDF, and therefore the angle DFH, is less than the
angle DHF.
Therefore DH is less than DF.
[l. 19]
Produce DH to G so that DG is equal to DE or AC, and join EG.
T h e n the triangle DEG, which is equal to the triangle ABC, is greater
than the triangle DEH, and therefore greater than the triangle DEF.
(3) Suppose the angles BAC, EDF together greater than two right
angles.

We make the same construction in this case, and we prove in like manner
that the angle DHF is less than the angle DEH,
whence DH is greater than DF or AC.
Make DG equal to AC, and join EG.
It then follows that the triangle DEF is greater than the triangle ABC.
[In the second and third cases again Proclus starts from the construction
in 1. 24, and proves, in the second case, that the parallel, EH, to ED cuts
DG and, in the third case, that it cuts DG produced.]
