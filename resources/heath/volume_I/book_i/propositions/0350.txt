There is no necessity for Heron to take account of the position of F in
relation to the side opposite D. For in the first and third cases F must fall

in the position in which Euclid draws it in 1. 24, whatever be the relative
lengths of AB, AC. In the second case the figure may be as annexed, but the
proof is the same, or rather the case needs no proof at all.

PROPOSITION

Equal
triangles
which are on the same base and on the
same side are also in the same
parallels.
Let ABC,

DBC

be equal triangles which are on the same

base BC and on the same side of it;
5 [I say that they are also in the same parallels.]
A n d [ F o r ] let AD
I say that AD

be joined ;

is parallel to BC.

For, if not, let AE be drawn through
the point A parallel to the straight line
'BC,
[1.31]
and let EC be joined.
Therefore the triangle ABC
to the triangle
EBC;
for it is on the same base BC
; parallels.
But ABC is equal to DBC;
therefore DBC

is equal
with it and in the

is also equal to EBC,

the greater to the less: which is impossible.
Therefore AE is not parallel to BC.
Similarly we can prove that neither is any other straight
line except
AD;
therefore AD

is parallel to BC.

Therefore etc.
