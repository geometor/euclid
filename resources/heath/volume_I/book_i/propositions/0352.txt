Similarly we can prove that neither is any other straight
line except
AD;
therefore AD

is parallel to

BE.

Therefore etc.

Heiberg has proved by means of the papyrus-fragment mentioned in the
last note that this proposition is an interpolation by some one who thought
that there should be a proposition following 1. 39 and related to it in the same
way as 1. 38 is related to 1. 37, and 1. 36 to 1. 35.

PROPOSITION 

41.

If a parallelogram
have the same base with a triangle and
be in the same parallels,
the parallelogram
is double of the
triangle.
For let the parallelogram ABCD
have the same base BC
with the triangle EBC,
and let it be in the same parallels
BC,
AE;
I say that the parallelogram ABCD
triangle
BEC.
For let AC be joined.
Then the triangle ABC
the triangle
EBC;

is double of

the

is equal to

for it is on the same base BC
and in the same parallels BC,
But the parallelogram ABCD
ABC;

with
AE.

it

['• 37]
is double of the triangle

for the diameter A C bisects it;
so that the parallelogram ABCD

[1. 34]

is also double of the triangle

EBC.
Therefore etc.
Q. E. D.

On this proposition Proclus (pp. 414, 1 5 — 4 1 5 , 16), " b y way of practice"
(•yv/irao-ias Ivcita), considers the area of a trapezium (a quadrilateral with only
one pair of opposite sides parallel) in comparison with that of the triangles
in the same parallels and having the greater and less of the parallel sides of
the trapezium for bases respectively, and proves that the trapezium is less
than double o f the former triangle and more than double of the latter.
H e next (pp. 4 1 5 , 22—416, 14) proves the proposition that,
If a triangle be formed by joining the middle point of either of the' nonparallel sides to the extremities of the opposite side, the area of the trapezium is
always double of that of the triangle.
