Let ABCD be a trapezium in which AD, BC are the parallel sides, and
E the middle point of one of the non-parallel sides,
say DC.
Join EA, EB and produce BE to meet AD
produced in F.
Then the triangles BEC, FED have two angles
equal respectively, and one side CE equal to one
side DE;
therefore the triangles are equal in all respects.
[1. 26]
A d d to each the quadrilateral
ABED;
therefore the trapezium ABCD is equal to the triangle ABE,
that is, to twice the triangle AEB, since BE is equal to EF. [1. 38]
T h e three properties proved by Proclus may be combined in one enuncia­
tion thus:
If a triangle be formed by joining the middle point of one side of a trapezium
to the extremities of the opposite side, the area of the trapezium is (1) greater
than, (2) equal to, or (3) less than, double the area of the triangle according as
the side the middle point of which is taken is (1) the greater of the parallel sides,
(2) either of the non-parallel sides, or (3) the lesser of the parallel sides.
