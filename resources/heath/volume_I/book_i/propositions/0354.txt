But the parallelogram FECG
is also double of the triangle
AEC,
for it has the same base with it and is in the same
parallels with it;
[1. 41]
therefore the parallelogram FECG
is equal to the
triangle
ABC.
A n d it has the angle CEF equal to the given angle D.
Therefore the parallelogram FECG
has been constructed
equal to the given triangle ABC, in the angle CEF which is
equal to D.

Q. E. F.

PROPOSITION

43.

In any parallelogram
the complements of the
about the diameter are equal to one another.

parallelograms

Let ABCD
be a parallelogram, and AC its diameter ;
and about A C let EH, FG be parallelograms, and BK,
KD
S the so-called complements ;
I say that the complement BK

is equal to the complement

KD.
For, since ABCD
is a parallelogram, and AC its diameter,
the triangle ABC is equal to
10
the triangle A CD. [1. 34]
Again, since EH is a parallelo­
gram, and AK is its diameter,
the triangle AEK
is equal to
the triangle
AHK.
15 For the same reason
the triangle KFC is also equal to KGC.
Now, since the triangle AEK
is equal to the triangle
AHK,
and KFC to KGC,
ao the triangle AEK
together with KGC is equal to the triangle
AHK
together with KFC.
[C. N. a]
A n d the whole triangle ABC is also equal to the whole
ADC;
therefore the complement BK which remains is equal to the
as complement KD which remains.
[C. N. 3]
Therefore etc.
