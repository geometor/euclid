FG be drawn through to H, and let AH
A parallel to either BG or EF.
Let HB be joined.
F

be. drawn through

Then, since the straight line HE falls upon the parallels
is AH,
EF,
the angles A HE, HFE are equal to two right angles.
[1. 29]
Therefore the angles BHG,
GFE are less than two right
angles;
and straight lines produced indefinitely from angles less than
20 two right angles meet;
[Post. 5]
therefore HB, EE, when produced, wilL meet.
Let them be produced and meet at K; through the point
K let KL be drawn parallel to either EA or EH,
[1. 31]
and let HA, GB be produced to the points L, M.

Then HLKF
is a parallelogram,
HK
is its diameter, and AG, ME are parallelograms, and
LB, BF the so-called complements, about HK;
therefore LB

is equal to BF.

[1. 43]

But BF is equal to the triangle C;
30

therefore LB

is also equal to C.

And, since the angle GBE

[C. N. 1]

is equal to the angle

ABM,

[**S]
while the angle GBE is equal to D,
the angle ABM
is also equal to the angle D.
Therefore the parallelogram LB equal to the given triangle
35 C has been applied to the given straight line AB, in the angle
ABM
which is equal to D.

Q. E. F.
14. since the straight line H F falls.... The verb is in the aorist (iviireotv) here and
in similar expressions in the following propositions.

This proposition will always remain one of the most impressive in all
geometry when account is taken (1) o f the great importance of the result
