(1) For the parabola, the square on the ordinate at any point is equal to
a rectangle applied to / as base with altitude equal to the corresponding
abscissa. That is to say, with the usual notation,
f=px.
(2) For the hyperbola and ellipse, the square on the ordinate is equal to
the rectangle applied to / having as its width the abscissa and exceeding (for
the hyperbola) or falling-short (for the ellipse) by a figure similar and similarly
situated to the rectangle contained by the given diameter and p.
x>
That is, in the hyperbola
or

y' =px + jjj pd,
f =px + ^ x';

and in the ellipse
y*=px — ^x'.
The form of these equations will be seen to be exactly the same as that of
the general equations above given, and thus Apollonius' nomenclature followed
exactly the traditional theory of application, exceeding, and falling-short.

angle, a

parallelogram

Let ABCD
be the given rectilineal figure and E the given
rectilineal angle;
5 thus it is required to construct, in the given angle E,
parallelogram equal to the rectilineal
figure
ABCD.

a

Let DB be joined, and let the parallelogram EH
be
constructed equal to the triangle ABD,
in the angle
HKF
which is equal to E;
[1. 4 2 ]
10 let the parallelogram GM equal to the triangle DBC
be
applied to the straight line GH, in the angle GHM which is
equal to E.
[1. 44]
Then, since the angle E is equal to each of the angles
HKF,
GHM,
is
the angle HKF is also equal to the angle GHM.
