Let the angle KHG be added to each ;
therefore the angles FKH,
KHG
are equal to the angles

KHG,

GHM.

But the angles FKH,
20 therefore the angles KHG,
angles.

KHG

are equal to two right angles;
[i. 29]
GHM are also equal to two right

Thus, with a straight line GH, and at the point H on it,
two straight lines KH, HM not lying on the same side make
the adjacent angles equal to two right angles ;
25
therefore KH is in a straight line with HM.
[1. 14]
And, since the straight line HG falls upon the parallels
KM, FG, the alternate angles MHG, HGF are equal to one
another.
[1. 29]
Let the angle HGL be added to each ;
30 therefore the angles MHG,
HGL
are equal to the angles

HGF,

HGL.

[CM

But the angies MHG,

a]

are equal to two right angles;
[1. 29]
therefore the angles HGF, HGL are also equal to two right
angles.
[C. M. 1]
35
Therefore FG.ia in a straight line with GL.
[1. 14]
And, since FK is equal and parallel to HG,
[1. 34]
and HG to ML also,
KF is also equal and parallel to ML ;
[C. M 1; 1.30]
and the straight lines KM, FL join them (at their extremities);
40 therefore KM, FL are also equal and parallel.
[1. 33]
Therefore KFLM
is a parallelogram.
And, since the triangle ABD
is equal to the parallelogram
F

H

<

HGL

and DBC to GM,

45 the whole rectilineal figure ABCD
is equal to the whole
parallelogram
KFLM.
Therefore the parallelogram KFLM
has been constructed
equal to the given rectilineal figure ABCD,
in the angle FKM
which is equal to the given angle E.

Transformation of areas.
W e can now take stock of how far the propositions I. 43—45 bring us in
the matter of transformation of areas, which constitutes so important a part of
