therefore the four straight lines i M , ^ 4 / ? , Z?if,
are equal to one another ;
therefore the parallelogram ADEB

is equilateral.

I say next that it is also right-angled.
For, since the straight line AD

therefore the angle ADE

in parallelogrammic areas the opposite sides and

25 angles are equal to one another ;
therefore each of the opposite angles ABE,

Therefore ADEB

Therefore it is a square; and it is described on the straight
line AB.
Q. E. F.
I, it 3°. Proclus (p. 423, i8sqq.) notes the difference between the word construct
(owrrii<rtur9(u) applied by Euclid to the construction of a triangle (and, he might have added,
of an angle) and the words describe on (dvaypaepeiv dV6) used of drawing a square on a given
straight line as one side. The triangle (or angle) is, so to say, pieced together, while the
describing of a square on a given straight line is the making of a figure " from " one side,
and corresponds to the multiplication of the number representing the side by itself.
Proclus (pp. 424—s) proves that, if squares are described on equal straight
lines, the squares are equal; and, conversely, that,
if two squares are equal, the straight lines are
equal on which they are described. T h e first
proposition is immediately obvious if we divide
the squares into two triangles by drawing a
diagonal in each. T h e converse is proved as
follows.
Place the two equal squares AF, CG so
that AB, BC are in a straight line. Then,
since the angles are right, FB, BG will also
be in a straight line. Join AF, FC, CG, GA.
Now, since the squares are equal, the
triangles ABF, CBG are equal.
A d d to each the triangle FBC; therefore the triangles AFC, GFC are
equal, and hence they must be in the same parallels.
