Therefore AG, CFslk parallel.
Also, since each of the alternate angles AFG,

FGC is half a right angle,

AF, CG are parallel.
Hence AFCG
is a parallelogram; and AF, CG are equal.
Thus the triangles ABF, CBG have two angles and one side respectively
equal;
therefore AB is equal to BC, and BF'to

BG.

In right-angled
triangles the square on the side
the right angle is equal to the squares on the sides
the right angle.
LET ABC
