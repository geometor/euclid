Cantor

(i , pp. 185—6), taking up an idea of Roth (Geschichie der abendlandischen
Philosophic, 11. 527), gives the following as a possible explanation of the way in
which Pythagoras arrived at his formula. If c = a + b', it follows that

= (c + b){c-b).

Numbers can be found satisfying the first equation if (1) c+ b and c — b are
either both even or both odd, and if further (2) c + b and c-b are such
numbers as, when multiplied together, produce a square number. T h e first
condition is necessary because, in order that c and b may both be whole
numbers, the sum and difference of c + b and c-b must both be even. T h e
second condition is satisfied if c + b and c - b are what were called similar
numbers (o/totot aptO/ioi); and that such numbers were most probably known
in the time before Plato may be inferred from their appearing in Theon of
Smyrna (Expositio rerum mathematicarum ad legendum Platonem utilium, ed.
Hiller, p. 36, 12), who says that similar plane numbers are, first, all square
numbers and, secondly, such oblong numbers as have the sides which contain
them proportional. Thus 6 is an oblong number with length 3 and breadth 2 ;
24 is another with length 6 and breadth 4. Since therefore 6 is to 3 as 4 is
to 2, the numbers 6 and 24 are similar.
Now the simplest case of two similar numbers is that of 1 and a", and,
since 1 is odd, the condition (1) requires that a , and therefore a, is also odd.
That is, we may take 1 and (2» + i ) and equate them respectively to c-b and
c+b, whence we have

A s Cantor remarks, the form in which c and b appear correspond sufficiently
closely to the description in the text of Proclus.
Another obvious possibility would be, instead of equating c-b to unity, to
put c-b = 2 , in which case the similar number c+b must be equated to
double of some square, i.e. to a number of the form 2n', or to the half of an
(2«y
even square number, say
. This would give
a = 2n,
b=

n*-i,

c = n' + 1,
which is Plato's solution, as given by Proclus.
T h e two solutions supplement each other. It is interesting to observe that
the method suggested by Roth and Cantor is very like that of Eucl. x .
(Lemma 1 following Prop. 28). W e shall come to this later, but it may be
mentioned here that the problem is to find two square numbers such that their
