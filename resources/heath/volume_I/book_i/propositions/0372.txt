sum is also a square. Euclid there uses the property of ii. 6 to the effect that,
if AB is bisected at C and produced to D,
AD.DB
+ BC' = CD*.
We may write this
uv = —
where
u = c+b, v = c-b.
In order that uv may be a square, Euclid points out that u and v must be
similar numbers, and further that u and v must be either both odd or both
even in order that b may be a whole number.
We may then put for the
similar numbers, say, a/3 and ay', whence (if af&, ay' are either both odd or
both even) we obtain the solution

But I think a serious, and even fatal, objection to the conjecture of Cantor
and Roth is the very fact that the method enables both the Pythagorean and
the Platonic series of triangles to be deduced with equal ease. If this had
been the case with the method used by Pythagoras, it would not, I think, have
been left to Plato to discover the second series of such triangles. It seems to
me therefore that Pythagoras must have used some method which would
produce his rule only; and further it would be some less recondite method,
suggested by direct observation rather than by argument from general
principles.
One solution satisfying these conditions is that of Bretschneider (p. 83),
who suggests the following simple method. Pythagoras was certainly aware
that the successive odd numbers are gnomons, or the differences between
successive square numbers. It was then a simple matter to write down in
three rows (a) the natural numbers, (b) their squares, (c) the successive odd
numbers constituting the differences between the successive squares in (b), thus:

Pythagoras had then only to pick out the numbers in the third row which are
squares, and his rule would be obtained by finding the formula connecting the
square in the third line with the two adjacent squares in the second line. But
even this would require some little argument; and I think a still better
suggestion, because making pure observation play a greater part, is that of
P. Treutlein (Zeitschrift fur Mathematik und Physik, x x v m . , 1883, Hist.-litt.
Abtheilung, pp. 209 sqq.).
W e have the best evidence (e.g. in Theon of Smyrna) of the practice of
representing square numbers and other figured numbers, e.g. oblong, triangular,
hexagonal, by dots or signs arranged in the shape of the particular figure.
(Cf. Aristotle, Metaph. 1092 b 12). Thus, says Treutlein, it would be easily
seen that any square number can be turned into the next higher square
by putting a single row of dots round two adjacent sides, in the form of a
gnomon (see figures on next page).
If a is the side of a particular square, the gnomon round it is shown by
simple inspection to contain 2a + 1 dots or units. Now, in order that 2a + 1
may itself be a square, let us suppose
ia + 1 = n ,
