The general effect of the criticisms is, I think, to show the necessity for
the greatest caution, to say the least, in accepting Biirk's conclusions.
I proceed to give a short summary of the portions of the contents of the
Apastamba-S.-S. which are important in the present connexion. It may be
premised that the general object of the book is to show how to construct
altars of certain shapes, and to vary the dimensions of altars without altering
the form. It is a collection of rules for carrying out certain constructions.
There are no proofs, the nearest approach to a proof being in the rule for
obtaining the area of an isosceles trapezium, which is done by drawing a
perpendicular from one extremity of the smaller of the two parallel sides to
the greater, and then taking away the triangle so cut off and placing it, the
other side up, adjacent to the other equal side Of the trapezium, thereby
transforming the trapezium into a rectangle. It should also be observed that
Apastamba does not speak of right-angled triangles, but of two adjacent sides
and the diagonal of a rectangle. For brevity, I shall use the expression
" rational rectangle " to denote a rectangle the two sides and the diagonal of
which can be expressed in terms of rational numbers. T h e references in
brackets are to the chapters and numbers of Apastamba's work.

(2) A general enunciation of the Pythagorean theorem thus: " T h e

the sum of what the longer and shorter sides separately produce [i.e. the
squares on the two sides J"

rectangle [i.e. to an isosceles right-angled triangle]: " T h e diagonal o f a square
