Subtracting from the former the two triangles ABC, EBF, and from the
latter the two equal triangles ABC, HLK, we prove that
the square CK is equal to the sum of the squares AE, CF.

In this elegant extension the triangle may be any triangle (not necessarily
right-angled), and any parallelograms take the place of squares on two Of the
sides.
Pappus (iv. p. 177) enunciates the theorem as follows:
If A B C be a triangle, and any parallelograms whatever A B E D , B C F G
be described on A B , B C , and if D E , F G be
produced to H , and H B be joined, the
parallelograms A B E D , B C F G are equal
to the parallelogram contained by A C ,
H B in an angle which is equal to the
sum of the angles B A C , D H B .
Produce HB to K; through A, C
draw AL. CM parallel to HK, and join
LM.
Then, since ALHB
is a paralleloD
gram, AL, HB are equal and parallel.
Similarly MC, HB are equal and parallel.
Therefore AL, MC are equal and
A
K
C
parallel;
whence LM, A C are also equal and parallel,
and ALMC is a parallelogram.
Further, the angle LAC oi this parallelogram is equal to the sum of the
angles BAC, DHB, since the angle DHB is equal to the angle LAB.
Now, since the parallelogram DABE is equal to the parallelogram LABH
(for they are on the same base AB and in the same parallels AB,
DH),
and likewise LABH is equal to LAKN (for they are on the same base LA
and in the same parallels LA, HK),
the parallelogram DABE is equal to the parallelogram LAKN.
For the same reason,
the parallelogram BGFC is equal to the parallelogram NKCM.
Therefore the sum of the parallelograms DABE, BGFC is equal to the
parallelogram LA CM, that is, to the parallelogram which is contained by A C,
HB in an angle LAC which is equal to the sum of the angles BAC,
BHD.
" A n d this is far more general than what is proved in the Elements about

T h e final words of Proclus' note on I. 47 (p. 429, 9 — 1 5 ) are historically
interesting. H e says: " T h e demonstration by the writer of the Elements being
clear, I consider that it is unnecessary to add anything further, and that we may
be satisfied with what has been written, since, in fact those who have added
anything more, like Pappus and Heron, were obliged to draw upon what is
proved in the sixth Book, for no really useful object." These words cannot
