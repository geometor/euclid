Heron now proceeds to prove the proposition that, in the accompanying
figure, if AKL perpendicular to BC meet
. E C in M, and if BM, MG be joined,
BM, MG are in one straight line.
Parallelograms are completed as shown
in the figure, and the diagonals OA, FH
of the parallelogram FH are drawn.
T h e n the triangles FAH, BAC are
clearly equal in all respects;
therefore the angle HFA is equal to
the angle ABC, and therefore to the angle
CAK (since AK \s perpendicular to BC).
But, the diagonals of the rectangle
FH cutting one another in Y,
FY is equal to YA,
and the angle HFA is equal to the
angle OAF.
Therefore the angles OAF, CAK are
equal, and accordingly
OA, AK are in a straight line.
Hence OM is the diagonal of SQ;
therefore AS is equal to AQ,
and, if we add AM to each,
FM is equal to MH.
But, since E C " is the diagonal of the parallelogram FN,
FM is equal to MN.
Therefore MH is equal to MN;
and, by the third lemma, BM, MG are in a straight line.

PROPOSITION 

48.

If in a triangle the square on one of the sides be equal to
the squares on the remaining
two sides of the triangle,
the
angle contained by the remaining
two sides of the triangle
is
right.
For in the triangle ABC

let the square on one side

be equal to the squares on the sides BA,

AC;

I say that the angle BA C is right.
For let AD be drawn from the point A at
right angles to the straight line AC, let
AD
be made equal to BA, and let DC be joined.
Since DA is equal to AB,
the square on DA
is also equal to the square
on AB.
Let the square on A C be added to each ;
