this is the hypothesis ;
therefore the square on DC

Q. E. D.

Proclus' note (p. 430) on this proposition, though it does not mention
Heron's name, gives an alternative proof, which is the same as that definitely
attributed by an-Nairizi to Heron, the only difference being that Proclus
demonstrates two cases in full, while Heron dismisses the second with a
"similarly." T h e alternative proof is another instance of the use of I. 7 as a
means of answering objections. If, says Proclus, it be not admitted that the
perpendicular AD may be drawn on the opposite side of A C from B, we may
draw it on the same side as AB, in which case it is impossible that it should
not coincide with AB. Proclus takes two cases,
first supposing that the perpendicular falls, as AD,
within the angle CAB, and secondly that it falls,
as AE, outside that angle. In either case the
absurdity results that, on the same straight line A C
and on the same side of it, AD, DC must be re­
spectively equal to AB, BC, which contradicts 1. 7.
Much to the same effect is the note of D e Morgan lhat there is here " an
appearance of avoiding indirect demonstration by drawing the triangles on
different sides of the base and appealing to 1. 8, because drawing them on the
same side would make the appeal to 1. 7 (on which, however, 1. 8 is founded)."
