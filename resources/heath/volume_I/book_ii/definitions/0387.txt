The form of these identities may of course be varied according to the different
symbols which we may use to denote particular portions of the lines given in
Euclid's figures. T h e y are, for the most part, simple identities, but there is no
reason to suppose that these were the only applications of the geometrical
algebra that Euclid and his predecessors had been able to make. W e may
infer the very contrary from the fact that Apollonius in his Conies frequently
states without proof much more complicated propositions of the kind.
It is important however to bear in mind that the whole procedure of
Book II. is geometrical; rectangles and squares are shown in the figures, and
the equality of certain combinations to other combinations is proved by those
figures. W e gather that this was the classical or standard method of proving
such propositions, and that the algebraical method of proving them, with no
figure except a line with points marked thereon, was a later introduction.
Accordingly Eutocius' method of proving certain lemmas assumed by
Apollonius (Conies, II. 23 and ill. 29) probably represents more nearly than
Pappus' proof of the same the point o f view from which Apollonius regarded
them.
It would appear that Heron was the first to adopt the algebraical method
of demonstrating the propositions of Book n., beginning from the second,
without figures, as consequences of the first proposition corresponding to
a(b + c + d) = ab + ac + ad,
According to an-Nairizi (ed. Curtze, p. 89), Heron explains that it is not
possible to prove n. 1 without drawing a number of lines (i.e. without actually
drawing the rectangles), but that the following propositions up to n. 10
inclusive can be proved by merely drawing one line. H e distinguishes two
varieties of the method, one by dissolutio, the other by compositio, by which he
seems to mean splitting-up of rectangles and squares, and combination of them
into others. But in his proofs he sometimes combines the two varieties.
When he comes to 11. I I , he says that it is not possible to do without a
figure because the proposition is a problem, which accordingly requires an
operation and therefore the drawing of a figure.
T h e algebraical method has been preferred to Euclid's by some English
editors; but it should not find favour with those who wish to preserve the
