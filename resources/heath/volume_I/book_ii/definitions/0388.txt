essential features o f Greek geometry as presented by its greatest exponents, or
to appreciate their point of view.
It may not be out o f place to add a word with reference to the geometrical
equivalent of the algebraical operations.
T h e addition and subtraction of
quantities represented in the geometrical algebra by lines is of course effected
by producing the line to the required extent or cutting off a portion of it. T h e
equivalent of multiplication is the construction of the rectangle of which the
given lines are adjacent sides. T h e equivalent of the division of one quantity
represented by a line by another quantity represented by a line is simply the
statement of a ratio between lines on the principles of Books v. and VI. T h e
division o f a product of two quantities by a third is represented in the
geometrical algebra by the finding o f a rectangle with one side of a given
length and equal to a given rectangle or square. This is the problem of
application of areas solved in I. 44, 45. T h e addition and subtraction of
products is, in the geometrical algebra, the addition and subtraction of
rectangles or squares; the sum or difference can be transformed into a single
rectangle by means of the application of areas to any line of given length,
corresponding to the algebraical process of finding a common measure. Lastly,
the extraction of the square root is, in the geometrical algebra, the finding of a
square equal to a given rectangle, which is done in II. 14 with the help of 1. 47.
