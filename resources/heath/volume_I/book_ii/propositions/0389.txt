PROPOSITION

I.

If there be two straight lines, and one of them be cut into
any number of segments whatever, the rectangle contained by
the two straight lines is equal to the rectangles contained by the
uncut straight line and each of the segments.
5

Let A, BC be two straight lines, and let BC be cut at
random at the points D, E ;

I say that the rectangle contained by A, BC is equal to the
rectangle contained by A,
BD,
that contained by A, DE and
.0 that contained by A, EC.
For let BF be drawn from B
at right angles to BC;
[i. n ]
let BG be made equal to A, [i. 3]
through G let GH be drawn
, parallel to BC,
[1. 31]
and through D, E, C let DK,
EL,
CH be drawn parallel to
BG.
Then BH is equal to BK, DL,
EH.
20
Now BH is the rectangle A, BC, for it is contained by
GB, BC, and BG is equal to A ;
BK is the rectangle A, BD, for it is contained by GB,
BD, and BG is equal to A ;
and DL is the rectangle A, DE, for DK, that is BG [1. 34],
25 is equal to A.
Similarly also EH is the rectangle A, EC.
Therefore the rectangle A, BC is equal to the rectangle
A, BD, the rectangle A, DE and the rectangle A, EC.
Therefore etc.
