t h e r e c t a n g l e A , B C . F r o m this point onward I shall translate thus in cases where
Euclid leaves out the word contained (reptexop-fov).
T h o u g h the word " r e c t a n g l e " is also
omitted in the Greek (the neuter article being sufficient to show that the rectangle is
meant), it cannot be dispensed with in English.
D e Morgan advises the use of the expres­
sion " the rectangle under t w o lines." This does not seem to me a very good expression,
and, if used in a translation from the Greek, it might suggest that iwi in TO UT6 meant
under, which it does not.

This proposition, the geometrical equivalent of the algebraical formula
a(b + c + d + ...) = ab + ac± ad +
can, of course, easily b e extended so as to correspond to the more general
algebraical proposition that the product of an expression consisting of any
number of terms added together and another expression also consisting of
any number of terms added together is equal to the sum of all the products
obtained b y multiplying each term of one expression by all the terms of the
other expression, one after another. T h e geometrical proof of the more
general proposition would be effected b y means of a figure showing all the
rectangles corresponding to the partial products, in the same way as they are
shown in the simpler case of II. i ; the difference would be that a series of
parallels to BC would have to be drawn as well as the series o f parallels
to BF.

PROPOSITION 

2.

If

a straight

line be cut at random,

by the whole and both of the segments
the

the rectangle
is equal

contained

to the square

on

whole.
For

let the straight line AB

be cut at random

at the

point C;
I say that the rectangle contained by AB,
the rectangle contained by BA,
to the square on

AC

BC

together with

is equal

AB.

For let the square ADEB
be described
on A B [1. 46], and let CE be drawn through
C parallel to either AD or BE.
[1. 31]
Then A E is equal to AF,
CE.
N o w A E is the square on A B ;
A F is the rectangle contained by
AC,
for it is contained by DA,
AC,
A D is equal to A B ;
and CE
AB.

is the rectangle AB,

BC,

BA,
and
for BE

is equal to

Therefore the rectangle BA, AC together with the rect­
angle AB, BC is equal to the square on AB.
Therefore etc.
