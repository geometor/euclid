120 words, of which 8 represent the construction. Euclid's as above trans­
lated has 126 words, of which 22 are descriptive of the construction; therefore
the actual proof by Euclid has 8 words fewer than Mr Taylor's, and the extra
words due to the construction in Euclid are much more than atoned for by
the advantage of picturing the result in the figure.
T h e advantages then which Euclid's method may claim are, I think, these:
in the case of 11. 2, 3 it produces the result more easily and clearly than does
the alternative proof by means of 11. 1, and, in its general application, it is
more powerful in that it makes us independent of any recollection of results.

Q. E. D.

If we leave out of account the contents of Book 11. itself and merely look
to the applicability of propositions to general use, this proposition and the
preceding are, as already indicated, of great importance, and particularly so to
the semi-algebraical method just described, which seems to have found its first
exponents in Heron and Pappus. T h u s the proposition that the difference of
the squares on two straight lines is equal to the rectangle contained by the sum
