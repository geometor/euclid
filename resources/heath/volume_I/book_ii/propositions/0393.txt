and the difference of the straight lines, which is generally given as equivalent to
II. s, 6, can be proved by means of II. i, 2, 3, as shown
by Lardner. For suppose the given straight lines are
C
P
AB, BC, the latter being measured along BA.
, Then, by 11. 2, the square on AB is equal to the sum o f the rectangles
AB, BC and AB, AC.
By 11. 3, the rectangle AB, BC is equal to the sum of the square on BC
and the rectangle AC, CB.
Therefore the square on AB is equal to the square BC together with the
sum of the rectangles AC, AB and AC, CB.
But, by 11. 1, the sum of the latter rectangles is equal to the rectangle
contained by AC and the sum of AB, BC, i.e. the rectangle contained by the
sum and difference of AB, BC.
Hence the square en AB is equal to the square on BC and the rectangle
contained by the sum and difference of AB, BO;
that is, the difference of the squares on AB, BC is equal to the rectangle
contained by the sum and difference of AB, BC.

PROPOSITION 

4.

If a straight line be cut at random, the square on the whole
is equal to the squares on the segments and twice the
rectangle
contained by the segments.
For let the straight line AB be cut at random at C;
s I say that the square on AB is equal to the squares on
CB and twice the rectangle contained
by AC, CB.

[1. 3 1 ]

Then, since CF is parallel to

AD,

has fallen on them,

the exterior angle CGB is equal to the interior and opposite
angle ADB.
But the angle ADB

since the side BA
therefore the angle CGB

[1. 29]
is equal to the angle
is also equal to AD

ABD,
;

is also equal to the angle

so that the side BC is also equal to the side CG.
