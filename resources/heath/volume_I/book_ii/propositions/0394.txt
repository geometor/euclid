But CB is equal to GK, and CG to KB;
therefore GK is also equal to KB;
therefore CGKB
is equilateral.

[1. 34]

I say next that it is also right-angled.
For, since CG is parallel to BK,
the angles KBC, GCB are equal to two right angles.
[1. 29]

But the angle KBC is right;
30

therefore the angle BCG is also right,
so that the opposite angles CGK, GKB are also right.
Therefore CGKB
is right-angled ;
and it was also proved equilateral;

therefore it is a square ;
35 and it is described on CB.
For the same reason
HF is also a square ;
and it is described on HG, that is AC.
[1. 34]
Therefore the squares HF, KC are the squares on A C, CB.
4°
Now, since A G is equal to GE,
and A G is the rectangle A C, CB, for GC is equal to CB,
therefore GE is also equal to the rectangle A C, CB.
Therefore A G, GE are equal to twice the rectangle A C,
CB.
45
But the squares HF, CK are also the squares on AC, CB;
therefore the four areas HF, CK, AG, GE are equal to
the squares on A C, CB and twice the rectangle contained by
AC, CB.
But HF, CK, AG, GE are the whole
ADEB,
5° which is the square on AB.
Therefore the square on AB is equal to the squares on
AC, CB and twice the rectangle contained by AC, CB.
Therefore etc.

twice the rectangle contained b y the segments.
By a curious idiom this is in
Greek " the rectangle twice contained by the segments." Similarly " twice the rectangle
contained by AC, CB" is expressed as " t h e rectangle twice contained by AC CB" (T6 US

I t is necessary to supply some substantive (the Greek leaves it to be under­
