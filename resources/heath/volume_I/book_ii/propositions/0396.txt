T h e proposition II. 4 can also be extended to the case where a straight
line is divided into any number of segments; for the figure will show in like
manner that the square on the whole line is equal to the sum of the squares
on all the parts together with twice the rectangles contained by every pair of
the parts.

PROPOSITION

5.

If a straight line be cut into equal and unequal
segments,
the rectangle contained by the unequal segments of the whole
together with the square on the straight line between the
points of section is equal to the square on the half.
For let a straight line AB be cut into equal segments
at C and into unequal segments at D ;
I say that the rectangle contained by AD, DB together with
the square on CD is equal to the square on CB.

For let the square CEFB

be described on CB,

[1. 46]

and let BE be joined ;
through D let DG be drawn parallel to either CE or BF,
through H again let KM be drawn parallel to either AB or
EF,
and again through A let AK be drawn parallel to either CL
or BM.
[1. 3 1 ]
Then, since the complement CH is equal to the comple­
ment HF,
[1.43]
let DM be added to each ;
therefore the whole CM is equal to the whole DF.
But CM is equal to AL,
since AC is also equal to CB;'
[1. 36]
therefore AL is also equal to DF.
Let CH be added to each ;
therefore the whole AH

is equal to the gnomon

NOP.
