Let LG,

Q. E. D.

3. b e t w e e n t h e p o i n t s o f s e c t i o n , literally " b e t w e e n the sections," the word being
the same (TOU^) as that used of a conic section.
I t will b e observed that the gnomon is indicated in the figure b y three separate letters
and a dotted curve. This is no doubt a clearer way of showing what exactly the gnomon is
than the method usual in our text-books.
In this particular case the figure of the MSS. has
two M's in it, the gnomon being MNH. I have corrected the lettering to avoid confusion.

It is easily seen that this proposition and the next give exactly the
theorem already alluded t o under the last propositions, namely that the
difference of the squares on two straight lines is equal to the rectangle contained
by their sum and difference. T h e two given lines are, in n. 5, the lines CB
and CD, and their sum and difference are respectively equal to AD and DB.
T o show that 11. 6 gives the same theorem we have only to make CD the
greater line and CB the less, i.e. to
draw CD equal to CB, measure

to BC, whence it is immediately clear
that A'D' on the second line is equal
to AD on the first, while D'B is also equal to DB, so that the rectangles
AD, DB and A'D, DB are equal, while the difference of the squares on
CB, CD is equal to the difference of the squares on CD, CB.
Perhaps the most important fact about II. 5, 6 is however their bearing on
the
Geometrical solution of a quadratic equation.
Suppose, in the figure of II. 5, that AB = a, DB = x;
then
ax - x = the rectangle AH
= the gnomon NOP.
Thus, if the area of the gnomon is given (=b , say), and if a is given
(= AB), the problem of solving the equation
ax-x = b
is, in the language of geometry, To a given straight line (a) to apply a rectangle
which shall be equal to a given square (b ) and shallfall short by a square figure,
i.e. to construct the rectangle AH ox the gnomon NOP.
Now we are told by Proclus (on 1. 44) that " these propositions are ancient
