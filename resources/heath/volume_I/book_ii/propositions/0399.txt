These symmetrical equations have really only one solution, as the two apparent
solutions are simply the result of interchanging the values of x and y.
This
form of the problem was known to Euclid, as appears from the Data, Prop.
85, which states that, If two straight lines contain a parallelogram given in
magnitude in a given angle, and if the sum of them be given, then shall each
of them be given.
This proposition then enables us to solve the problem of finding a
rectangle the area and perimeter of which are both g i v e n ; and it also enables
us to infer that, of all rectangles of given perimeter, the square has the
greatest area, while, the more unequal the sides are, the less is the area.
If in the figure of 11. 5 we suppose that AD = a, BD = b, we find that
CB = (a + b)l't and CD = (a—b)J2, and we may state the result of the
proposition in the following algebraical form

This way of stating it (which could hardly have escaped the Pythagoreans)
gives a ready means of obtaining the two rules, respectively attributed to the
Pythagoreans and Plato, for finding integral square numbers which are the
sum of two other integral square numbers. W e have only to make ab a
perfect square in the above formula. T h e simplest way in which this can be
done is to put a = n*, b = 1, whence we have
/»• + i\*

/«»-i\«

„

and in order that the first two squares may be integral
must be odd. Hence the Pythagorean rule.
Suppose next that a = 2n\ b = 2, and we have
,

(«»+I) -(»'-I)

,

and therefore n,

= 4»*,

whence Plato's rule starting from an even number 2».

PROPOSITION

6.

If a straight line be bisected and a straight line be added
to it in a straight line, the rectangle contained by the whole
with the added straight line and the added straight line together
with the square on the half is equal to the square on the
straight
line made up of the half and the added
straight
line.
For let a straight line AB be bisected at the point C, and
let a straight line BD be added to it in a straight line ;
I say that the rectangle contained by AD, DB together
with the square on CB is equal to the square on CD.
For let the square CEFD
be described on CD,
[1. 46]
and let DE be joined ;
through the point B let BG be drawn parallel to either EC
DF,

or
