through the point H let KM

[1. 3 1 ]
Then, since AC is equal
to CB,
AL is also equal to CH. [1. 36]
But CH is equal to HF.
[1. 43]
Therefore AL is also equal
to HF.

Let LG,

therefore the rectangle contained by AD, DB

are the whole square

therefore the rectangle contained by AD, DB together
with the square on CB is equal to the square on CD.
Therefore etc.
Q. E. D.
In this case the rectangle AD, DB is " a rectangle applied to a given
straight line (AB) but exceeding by a square (the side of which is equal to
BD)";
and the problem suggested by 11. 6 is to find a rectangle of this
description equal to a given area, which we will, for convenience, suppose to
be a square; i.e., in the language of geometry, to apply to a given straight
line a rectangle which shall be equal to a given square and shall exceed by a
square figure.
We suppose that in Euclid's figure AB = a, BD = x; then, if the given
square be b, the problem is to solve geometrically the equation

ax + x = b*.
T h e solution of a problem theoretically equivalent to the solution of a
quadratic equation of this kind is presupposed in the fragment of Hippocrates'
