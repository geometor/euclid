this fragment Hippocrates (5th cent. B.C.) assumes the following construction.
AB being the diameter and O the centre of a semicircle, and C being the
middle point of OB and CD at right
angles to AB, a straight line of length
such that its square is \ \ times the square
on the radius (i.e. of length aj%, where
a is the radius) is to be so placed, as EF,
between CD and the circumference AD
.hat it "verges towards B," that is, EF
when produced passes through B.
Now the right-angled triangles BFC,
BAE are similar, so that
BF: BC=BA
: BE,
and therefore the rectangle BE, BF= rect. BA, BC
= sq. on BO.
In other words, EF (= a J$) being given in length, BF ( = x, say) has
to be found such that
( 7 4 a + x)x = a';
or the quadratic equation
7 4 ax + x = a
has to be solved.
A straight line of length a 7 4 would easily be constructed, for, in the
figure, CEP = AC. CB^%a\ or CD = \a
and a 7 4 is the diagonal of
a square of which CD is the side.
There is no doubt that Hippocrates could have solved the equation by
the geometrical construction given below, but he may have contemplated, on
this occasion, the merely mechanical process of placing the straight line of the
length required between CD and the circumference AD and moving it until
E, F, B were in a straight line. Zeuthen (Die Lehre von den Kegelschnitten
im Altertum, pp. 270, 2 7 1 ) thinks this probable because, curiously enough,
the fragment speaks immediately afterwards of "joining B to F."
T o solve the equation
ax + x =b*
Q
we have to find the rectangle AH, or the
gnomon NOP, which is equal in area to P and
has one of the sides containing the inner right
angle equal to CB or \a. T h u s we know
(\df and &, and we have to find, by 1. 47,
a square equal to the sum of two given
squares.
T o d o this Simson draws BQ at right
angles to AB and equal to b, joins CQ and,
with centre C and radius CQ, describes a
circle cutting AB produced in D. T h u s
BD, or x, is found.
Now the rectangle AD, DB together with the square o n CB
is equal to the square on CD,
Le. to the square on CQ,
i.e. to the squares on CB, BQ.
