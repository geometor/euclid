Therefore the rectangle AD, DB is equal to the square on BQ, that is,
a

aX + X = 0>.
From Euclid's point of view there would only b e one solution in this case.
This proposition enables us also to solve the equation
x — ax = 6
in a similar manner.
W e have only to suppose that AB = a, and AD (instead of BD) = x; then
x —ax = the gnomon.
T o find the gnomon we have its area (P) and the area, CB or (jo)', by
which the gnomon differs from CD*. T h u s we can find D (and therefore
AD or x) b y the same construction as that just given.
Converse propositions to n . 5, 6 are given by Pappus (VII. pp. 948—950)
among his lemmas to the Conies of Apollonius to the effect that,
(1) if D b e a point dividing AB unequally, and C another point on AB
such that the rectangle AD, DB together with the square on CD is
equal to the square on A C, then
AC is equal to CB;

if D b e a point on AB produced, and C a point on AB such that the
rectangle AD, DB together with the square on CB is equal to the
square on CD, then

PROPOSITION 

7.

If
a straight
line be cut at random,
the square on the
whole and that on one of the segments both together are equal
to twice the rectangle
contained
by the whole and the said
segment and the square on the remaining
segment.
For let a straight line A B be cut at random at the point C;
I say that the squares on AB, BC are equal to twice the
rectangle contained by AB, BC and the
square on CA.
For
let the square ADEB
be
described on AB,
[1. 46]
and let the figure be drawn.
Then, since A G is equal to GE, [1. 43]
let CF be added to each ;
therefore the whole AF
the whole CE.
Therefore AF,

CE

are

is equal to
double

of

AF.
But AF, CE are the gnomon KLMand
the square CF;
therefore the gnomon KLM
and the square CF are double
of AF.
