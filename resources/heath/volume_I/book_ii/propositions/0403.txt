But twice the rectangle AB,
for BF is equal to BC;

BC

is also double of

AF;

therefore the gnomon KLM
and the square CF are equal to
twice the rectangle AB,
BC.
Let DG, which is the square on A C, be added to each ;
therefore the gnomon KLM
and the squares BG, GD are
equal to twice the rectangle contained by AB, BC and the
square on AC.
But the gnomon KLM
whole ADEB
and CF,

and the squares BG,

GD

are the

which are squares described on AB,
BC;
therefore the squares on AB, BC are equal to twice the
rectangle contained by AB, BC together with the square on
AC.
Therefore etc.
Q. E. D.
A n interesting variation of the form of this proposition may be obtained by
regarding AB, BC as two given straight lines of which AB is the greater, and
AC as the difference between the two straight lines. T h u s the proposition
shows that the squares on two straight lines are together equal to twice the
rectangle contained by them and the square on their difference. T h a t is, the
square on the difference of two straight lines is equal to the sum of the squares on
the straight lines diminished by twice the rectangle contained by them. In other
words, just as II. 4 is the geometrical equivalent of the identity
{a + bf = d + b* + 20b,
so 11. 7 proves that
(a-b)' = a* + b -2ab.
T h e addition and subtraction of these formulae give the algebraical equivalent
of the propositions 11. 9, 10 and 11. 8 respectively; and we have accordingly
a suggestion of alternative methods of proving those propositions.

PROPOSITION

8.

If a straight line be cut at random, four times the rectangle
contained by the whole and one of the segments together
with
the square on the remaining
segment is equal to the square
described on the whole and the aforesaid segment as on one
straight
line.
For let a straight line AB be cut at random at the point C;
I say that four times the rectangle contained by AB,
BC
together with the square on AC
is equal to the square
described on AB, BC as on one straight line.
