therefore GK is also equal to KN.
For the same reason
QR is also equal to RP.

And, since BC is equal to BD, and G A to KN,
therefore CK is also equal to KD, and GR to A W .

But C A ' is equal to RN, for they are complements of the
parallelogram CP;
[i. 43]
therefore KD is also equal to GR;
therefore the four areas DK, CK, GR, RN are equal to one
another.
Therefore the four are quadruple of CK.
Again, since CB is equal to BD,
while BD is equal to BK, that is CG,
and CB is equal to GK, that is GQ,
therefore CG is also equal to GQ.
And, since CG is equal to GQ, and QR to RP,
AG is also equal to

Therefore the four are quadruple of A G.
But the four areas CK, KD, GR, RN were proved to be

therefore the eight areas, which contain the gnomon
