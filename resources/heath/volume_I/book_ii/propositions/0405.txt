therefore four times the rectangle AB, BD is quadruple of
AK.
But the gnomon STU was also proved to be quadruple
oSAK;
therefore four times the rectangle AB,
gnomon
STU.
Let OH,
to each ;

BD

is equal to the

which is equal to the square on AC,

therefore four times the rectangle AB, BD
the square on AC is equal to the gnomon STU
But

the gnomon

STU

and

OH

be added

together with
and OH.

are the whole square

AEFD,
which is described on AD •
therefore four times the rectangle AB,

BD

the square on A C is equal to the square on
But BD
therefore

is equal to

four

BC;

times the rectangle contained by AB,

AD,

BC

that is to the square described on AB

Q. E. D.

This proposition is quoted by Pappus (p. 428, ed. Hultsch) and is used
also by Euclid himself in the Data, Prop. 86. Further, it is of decided use
in proving the fundamental property of a parabola.
T w o alternative proofs are worth giving.
T h e first is that suggested by the consideration mentioned in the last
note, though the proof is old enough, being given by Clavius and others. It
is of the semi-algebraical type.
Produce AB to D (in the figure of the proD
A
C
B
position), so that BD is equal to BC.
By 11. 4, the square on AD is equal to the
14
squares on AB, BD and twice the rectangle AB,
L
BD, i.e. to the squares on AB, BC and twice
the rectangle AB, BC.
By 11. 7, the squares on AB, BC are equal to
N
twice the rectangle AB, BC together with the
P
square on AC.
Therefore the square on AD is equal to four
times the rectangle AB, BC together with the
square on A C.
T h e second proof is after the manner of Euclid but with a difference.
Produce BA to D so that AD is equal to BC. O n BD construct the square
BEFD.
