T a k e BG, EH, FK each equal to BC or AD, and draw ALP,
HNM
parallel to BE and GML, KPN parallel to BD.
T h e n it can be shown that each of the rectangles BL, AK, FN, EM is
equal to the rectangle AB, BC, and that PM is equal to the square on AC.
Therefore the square on BD is equal to four times the rectangle AB,
BC together with the square on AC.

PROPOSITION 

9.

If a straight line be cut into equal and unequal
segments,
the squares on the unequal segments of the whole are double
of the square on the half and of the square on the straight line
between the points of section.
For let a straight line AB be cut into equal segments
at C, and into unequal segments at D;
I say that the squares on AD, DB are double of the
squares on AC, CD.
For let CE be drawn from
C at right angles to
AB,
and let it be made equal to
either AC or CB ;
let EA, EB be joined,
let DF be drawn through D
parallel to EC,
and FG through F parallel to
AB,
and let AF be joined.
Then, since AC is equal to CE,
the angle EAC is also equal to the angle A EC.
And, since the angle at C is right,
the remaining angles EAC,
AEC
are equal to one
right angle.
[1. 32]
A n d they are equal;
therefore each of the angles CEA, CAE is half a right
angle.
For the same reason
each of the angles CEB, EBC is also half a right angle;
therefore the whole angle AEB is right.
And, since the angle GEF is half a right angle.
