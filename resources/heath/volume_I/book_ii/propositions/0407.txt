and the angle EGF is right, for it is equal to the interior and
opposite angle ECB,
[1. 29]
the remaining angle EFG is half a right angle; [1. 32]
therefore the angle GEE is equal to the angle EFG,
so that the side EG is also equal to GF.
[1. 6]
Again, since the angle at B is half a right angle,
and the angle FDB is right, for it is again equal to the interior
and opposite angle ECB,
[1. 29]
the remaining angle BFD is half a right angle ; [1. 32]
therefore the angle at B is equal to the angle DFB,
so that the side FD is also equal to the side DB.
Now, since AC is equal to CE,

[1. 6]

the square on AC is also equal to the square on CE;
therefore the squares on AC, CE are double of the square
on AC.
But the square on EA is equal to the squares on AC, CE,
for the angle ACE is right;
[1. 47]
therefore the square on EA is double of the square on A C.
Again, since EG is equal to GF,
the square on EG is also equal to the square on GF;
therefore the squares on EG, GF are double of the square on
GF.
But the square on EF is equal to the squares on EG, GF;
therefore the square on EF is double of the square on GF.
But GF is equal to CD ;
[j. 34]
therefore the square on EF is double of the square on CD.
But the square on EA is also double of the square on A C;
therefore the squares on AE, EFare
double of the squares
on AC, CD.
A n d the square on AF is equal to the squares on AE,
EF,
for the angle AEF is right;
[1. 47]
therefore the square on AF is double of the squares on A C,
CD.
•
But the squares on AD, DF are equal to the square on
AF, for the angle at D is right;
[i. 47]
therefore the squares on AD,
on AC, CD.

DF

are double of the squares
