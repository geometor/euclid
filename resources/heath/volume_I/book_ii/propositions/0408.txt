Therefore etc.

are double of the squares

Q. E. D.

It is noteworthy that, while the first eight propositions of Book 11. are
proved independently of the Pythagorean theorem I. 47, all the remaining
propositions beginning with the 9th are proved by means of it. Also the 9th
and 10th propositions mark a new departure in another respect; the method
of demonstration by showing in the figures the various rectangles and squares
to which the theorems relate is here abandoned.
T h e 9th and 10th propositions are related to one another in the same way
as the 5th and 6 t h ; they really prove the same result which can, as in the
earlier case, be comprised in a single enunciation thus : The sum of the squares
on the sum and difference of two given straight lines is equal to twice the sum of
the squares on the lines.
T h e semi-algebraical proof of Prop. 9 is that suggested by the remark on
the algebraical formulae given at the end of the note on II. 7. It applies
with a very slight modification to both n. 9 and n . 10. W e will put in
brackets the variations belonging to II. 10.

By 11. 4, the square on AD is equal to
A P
B
D
the squares on AC, CD and twice the
+
rectangle AC, CD.
By 11. 7, the squares on CB, CD (CD, CE) are equal to
twice the rectangle CB, CD together with the square on BD.
By addition of these equals crosswise,
the squares on AD, DB together with twice the rectangle CB, CD are
equal to the squares o n AC, CD, CB, CD together with twice
the rectangle AC, CD.
But AC, CB are equal, and therefore the rectangles AC, CD and CB,
CD are equal.
T a k i n g away the equals, we see that
the squares on AD, DB are equal to the squares on AC, CD, CB, CD,
i.e. to twice the squares on A C, CD.
T o show also that the method of geometrical algebra illustrated by
11. 1—8 is still effective for the purpose of
proving 11. 9, 10, we will now prove 11. 9 in

that manner.
