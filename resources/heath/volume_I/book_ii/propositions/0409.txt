Now, since AD, CD are respectively equal to DE, DH,
HE is equal to A C or CB;
and, since HL is equal to CD, LE is equal to DB.
Similarly, since each of the segments EM, MQ is equal to CD,
FQ is equal to EL or BD.
Therefore OQ is equal to the square on DB.
We have to prove that the squares on AD, DB are equal to twice the
squares on AC, CD.
Now the square on AD includes KM (the square on A C) and CH, HN
(that is, twice the square on CD).
Therefore we have to prove that what is left over of the square on AD
together with the square on DB is equal to the square on A C.
T h e parts left over are the rectangles CK and NE, which are equal to
KN, PM respectively.
But the latter with the square on DB are equal to the rectangles KN,
PM and the square OQ,
i.e. to the square KM, or the square on AC.
Hence the required result follows.

PROPOSITION 

10.

If a straight line be bisected, and a straight
line be added
to it in a straight line, the square on the whole with the added
straight line and the square on the added straight
line
both
together are double of the square on the half and of the square
described on the straight
line made up of the half and the
added straight
line as on one straight
line.
For let a straight line AB
be bisected at C, and let a
straight line BD be added to it in a straight line ;
I say that the squares on AD,
squares on AC,
CD.
