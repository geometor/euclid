[II. I O

the angles CEF, EFD are equal to two right angles; [i. 29]
therefore the angles FEB,
EFD
are less than two right
angles.
But straight lines produced from angles less than two
right angles meet;
[1. Post. 5]
therefore EB, FD, if produced in the direction B, D, will
meet.
Let them be produced and meet at G,
and let AG be joined.
Then, since AC is equal to CE,
the angle EAC is also equal to the angle A EC;
[1. 5]
and the angle at C is right;
therefore each of the angles EAC, A EC is half a right
angle.
[1.32]
For the same reason
each of the angles CEB, EBC is also half a right angle ;
therefore the angle AEB is right.
And, since the angle EBC is half a right angle,
the angle DBG is also half a right angle.
[1. 15]
But the angle BDG is also right,
for it is equal to the angle DCE, they being alternate; [1. 29]
therefore the remaining angle DGB is half a right angle ;
['• 32]

therefore the angle DGB is equal to the angle DBG,
so that the side BD is also equal to the side GD.
[1. 6]
Again, since the angle EGF is half a right angle,
and the angle at F is right, for it is equal to the opposite
angle, the angle at C,
[1. 34]
the remaining angle FEG is half a right angle ;
[1. 32]
therefore the angle EGF is equal to the angle FEG,
so that the side GF is also equal to the side EF.
[1. 6]
Now, since the square on EC is equal to the square on
CA,
the squares on EC, CA are double of the square on CA.
But the square on EA is equal to the squares on EC, CA;
[••47]

therefore the square on EA

is double of the square on A C.
