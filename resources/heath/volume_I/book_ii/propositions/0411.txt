Again, since FG is equal to EF,
the square on EG is also equal to the square on EE;
therefore the squares on GE, EE are double of the square on
EF.
But the square on EG is equal to the squares on GF,

EE;
[* 47]

therefore the square on EG is double of the square on EE.
And EE is equal to CD ;
[i- 34]
therefore the square on EG is double of the square on CD.
But the square on EA was also proved double of the square
on^C;
therefore the squares on AE, EG are double of the squares
on AC, CD.
And the square on AG is equal to the squares on AE,
EG;
[1. 4 7 ]
therefore the square on AG is double of the squares on AC,
CD.
But the squares on AD, DG are equal to the square on AG;
[i- 4 7 ]

therefore the squares on AD,
on AC, CD.
And DG is equal to

DG

are double of the squares

DB

are double of the squares

DB;

therefore the squares on AD,
on AC, CD.
Therefore etc.

Q. E. D.

T h e alternative proof of this proposition by means of the principles
exhibited in 11. 1—8 follows the lines of that
which I have given for the preceding proposition.
It is at once obvious from the figure that the
square on AD includes within it twice the square
H
G
on AC together with once the square on CD.
What is left over is the sum of the rectangles AH,
KE.
These, which are equivalent to BH, GK,
tc
make up the square on CD less the square on
BD.
Adding therefore the square BG to each
side, we have the required result.
Another alternative proof of the theorem which
includes both n. 9 and 10 is worth giving. T h e
theorem states that the sum of the squares on the
sum and difference of two given straight lines is equal to twice the sum of the
squares on the lines.
