Let AD, DB be the two given straight lines (of which AD is the greater),
placed so as to be in one straight line. Make A C equal to DB and com­
plete the figure as shown, each of the segments CG
and DH being equal to AC or DB.
Now, AD, DB being the given straight lines, AB
is their sum and CD is equal to their difference.

A l s o AD is equal to BC.
A n d AE is the square on AB, GK is equal to
the square on CD, AK or EH is the square on AD,
and BL the square on CB, while each of the small

squares AG, BH, EK, FL is equal to the square on
AC or DB.
W e have to prove that twice the squares on AD,
DB are equal to the squares on AB, CD.
Now twice the square on AD is the sum of the squares on AD, CB,
which is equal to the sum of the squares BL, FH; and the figure shows
these to be equal to twice the inner square GK and once the remainder of
the large square AE excluding the two squares A G, KE, which latter squares
are equal to twice the square on A C or DB.
Therefore twice the squares on AD, DB are equal to twice the inner
square GK together with once the remainder of the large square AE, that is,
to the sum of the squares AE, GK, which are the squares on AB, CD.

analysis which received much attention from
the ancient Greeks. I f we take the straight line AB divided at C and D as
in 11. 9, and if we put CD = x, DB =y, the result obtained by Euclid, namely:
1

AD* + DB = 2AC* + 2 CD*,
t

or

AD>-2AC=2CD'-DB ,

becomes the formula
(tx +yf—2

(x +yf = 2x* -y*.

If therefore x, y be numbers which satisfy one of the two equations
x* —y~ = + 1,
the formula gives us two higher numbers, x +y and 2x + y, which satisfy the
other of the two equations.
Euclid's propositions thus give a general proof of the very formula used
for the formation of the succession of what were called "side" and "diagonal
numbers."
A s is well known, T h e o n of Smyrna (pp. 43, 44, ed. Hiller) describes this
system of numbers. T h e unit, being the beginning of all things, must be
potentially both a side and a diameter. Consequently we begin with two units,
the one being the first side and the other the first diameter, and (a) from the
sum of them, (b) from the sum of twice the first unit and once the second, we
form two new numbers
1 . 1 + 1 = 2, a . ' 1 + 1 = 3.
