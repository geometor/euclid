Of these new numbers the first is a side- and the second a diagonal-number,
or (as we may say)
a = 2,
^ = 3.
In the same way as these numbers were formed from o, = 1,0",= i , successive
pairs of numbers are formed from a , d , and so on, according to the formula

and so on.
Theon states, with reference to these numbers, the general proposition that
<*•»•= a « . ' ± 1,
and he observes (1) that the signs alternate as successive d's and a's are taken,
«V - aa, being equal to - 1, «,* - 2a, equal to + 1, d} - 20} equal to 1, and
so on, (2) that the sum of the squares of all the d's will be double of the sum
of the squares of all the a's. [If the number of successive terms in each
series is finite, it is of course necessary that the number should be even.]
T h e proof, no doubt omitted because it was well known, may be put
algebraically thus

ana so on, while </,*- 2a* = - 1. T h u s the theorem is established.
Euclid's propositions enable us to establish the theorem geometrically;
and this fact might well be thought to confirm the conjecture that the
investigation of the indeterminate equation 2** —y* = + 1 in the manner
explained by Theon was no new thing but began at a period long before
Euclid's time. N o one familiar with the truth of the proposition stated by
Theon could have failed to observe that, as the corresponding side- and
diagonal-numbers were successively formed, the value of d£\a£ would
approach more and more nearly to 2, and consequently that the successive
fractions d /a would give nearer and nearer approximations to the value of

It is fairly clear that in the famous passage of Plato's Republic (546 c )
about the "geometrical number" some such system of approximations is
hinted a t Plato there contrasts the "rational diameter of five" (pirrr) STA/tcrpof
rry* ir«/«ro8os) with the "irrational" (diameter). This was certainly taken
from the Pythagorean theory of numbers (cf. the expression immediately
preceding, 546 B, C iroVTa vpoo-)jyopa kou pnra 7roo9 oAAijAa dn(<f>r)vav, with the
phrase i r o v r o yvmorb. Kai lrordyopa dWdkoit dwtpyaXrrai
in the fragment of
Philolaus). T h e reference of Plato is to the following consideration. If the
square of side 5 be taken, the diagonal is V 2 . 2 5 or
This is the
Pythagorean " irrational diameter " o f 5 ; and the " rational diameter " was
the approximation J50 - 1, or 7.
But the conjecture of Zeuthen, and the attribution of the whole theory of
side- and diagonal-numbers to the Pythagoreans, have now been fully confirmed
by the publication of Kroll's edition of Prodi Diadochi in Platonis rempublicam
commentarii (Teubner), V o l . II., 1901. T h e passages (cc. 23 and 27, pp. 24,
25 and 27—29) which there saw the light for the first time describe the same
