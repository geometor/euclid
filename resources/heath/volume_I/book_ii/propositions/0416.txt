points of the diagonals. Euler seems however to have proved the property
from the corresponding theorem for parallelograms just quoted (cf. Camerer's
Euclid, Vol. i. pp. 468, 469) and not from the property of the triangle, though
the latter brings out the result more easily.

PROPOSITION

II.

To cut a given straight line so that the rectangle
contained
by the whole and one of the segments is equal to the square on
the remaining
segment.
Let AB be the given straight line ;
thus it is required to cut AB so that the rectangle contained
by the whole and one of the segments is
equal to the square on the remaining
segment.
For let the square ABDC
be described
on AB;
[1. 46]
H B
let AC be bisected at the point E, and let
BE be joined ;
let CA be drawn through to F, and let EF
be made equal to BE;
f

Q

let the square FH be described on AF, and
let GH be drawn through to K.
I say that AB has been cut at H so as to make the
rectangle contained by AB, BH equal to the square on AH.
For, since the straight line AC
and FA is added to it,

has been bisected at E,

the rectangle contained by CF, FA together with the
square on AE is equal to the square on EF.
[n. 6]
But EF is equal to EB ;
therefore the rectangle CF, FA together with the square
on AE is equal to the square on EB.
EB,

But the squares on BA, AE are equal to the square on
for the angle at A is right:
[1. 47]

therefore the rectangle CF, FA together with the square
on AE is equal to the squares on BA,
AE.
Let the square on AE be subtracted from each;
therefore the rectangle CF, FA which remains is equal to
the square on AB.
