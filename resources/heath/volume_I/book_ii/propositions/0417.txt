therefore the given straight line AB has been cut at H
so as to make the rectangle contained by AB, BH equal to
the square on HA.
Q. E. F.

A s the solution of this problem is necessary to that of inscribing a regular
pentagon in a circle (Eucl. iv. 10, 1 1 ) , we must necessarily conclude that it
was solved by the Pythagoreans, or, in other words, that they discovered the
geometrical solution of the quadratic equation
a(a-x)
= x,
or
x + ax = <r.

The solution in 11. 1 1 , too, exactly corresponds to the solution of the more
general equation
x' + ax^P,
which, as shown above (pp. 387—8), Simson based upon 11. 6. Only Simson's
solution, if applied here, gives us the point Eon CA produced and does not
directly find the point H. It takes £ the middle point of CA, draws AB at
right angles to CA and of length equal to CA, and then describes a circle
with EB as radius cutting EA produced in F. T h e only difference between
the solution in this case and in the more general case is that AB is here equal
to CA instead of being equal to another given straight line b.
As in the more general case, there is, from Euclid's point of view, only one
solution.
T h e construction shows that CF is also divided at A in the manner
described in the enunciation, since the rectangle CF, FA is equal to the
square on CA.
The problem in 11. 1 1 reappears in v i . 30 in the form of cutting a given
straight line in extreme and mean ratio.

In obtuse-angled triangles the square on the side
subtending
the obtuse angle is greater
than the squares on the sides con­
taining the obtuse angle by twice the rectangle contained by one
of the sides about the obtuse angle, namely that on which the
