Let ABC
be an obtuse-angled triangle having the angle

obtuse, and let BD be drawn from the point B per­
pendicular to CA produced;
I say that the square on BC is greater than the squares
on BA, AC by twice the rectangle con­
tained by CA,
AD.
For, since the straight line CD

the

Let the square on DB

be added to

therefore the squares on CD, DB are equal to the squares on
CA, AD, DB and twice the rectangle CA,
AD.
But the square on CB is equal to the squares on CD, DB,
for the angle at D is right;
[t 47]
and the square on A B is equal to the squares on
DB;

AD,

so that the square on CB is greater than the squares on

AD.
Therefore etc.

Q. E. D.

Since in this proposition and the next we have to d o with the squares on
the sides of triangles, the particular form of graphic representation of areas
which we have had in Book 11. up to this point does not help us to visualise
the results of the propositions in the same way, and only two lines of proof
are possible, ( 1 ) by means of the results of certain earlier propositions in
B o o k II. combined with the result of 1. 47 and (2) by means of the procedure
in Euclid's proof of 1. 47 itself. T h e alternative proofs of n . 12, 13 after the
manner of Euclid's proof of 1. 47 are therefore alone worth giving.
These proofs appear in certain modern text-books (e.g. Mehler, Henrici and
Treutlein, H . M . Taylor, Smith and Bryant). Smith and Bryant are not
correct in saying (p. 142) that they cannot be traced further back than
Lardner's Euclid ( 1 8 2 8 ) ; they are to be found in Gregory of St. Vincent's
work (published in 1647) Opus geometricum quadrature* circuit et sectionum
com, Book 1. Pt. 2, Props. 44, 45 (pp. 31, 32).
T o prove II, 12, take an obtuse-angled triangle ABC in which the angle at
A is the obtuse angle
