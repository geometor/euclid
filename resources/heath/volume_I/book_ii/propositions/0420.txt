Therefore the angle BAC is greater than the angle DAC;
that is, the angle BA C is obtuse.

.

In acute-angled triangles the square on the side
subtending
the acute angle is less than the squares on the sides
containing
the acute angle by twice the rectangle contained by one of the
sides about the acute angle, namely that on which the per­
pendicular
jails,
and the straight line cut off within by the
perpendicular
towards the acute angle.
Let ABC be an acute-angled triangle having the angle
at B acute, and let AD be drawn from the point A perpen­
dicular to BC;
I say that the square on AC is less than the squares on
CB, BA by twice the rectangle contained
by CB, BD.
For, since the straight line CB has
been cut at random at D,
the squares on CB, BD are equal to
twice the rectangle contained by CB, BD
and the square on DC.
[ii. 7]
Let the square on DA be added to
each;
therefore the squares on CB, BD, DA are equal to twice
the rectangle contained by CB, BD and the squares on AD,
DC.
But the square on AB is equal to the squares on BD,
DA, for the angle at D is right;
[1. 47]
and the square on AC is equal to the squares on AD,
DC;
therefore the squares on CB, BA are equal to the square on
A C and twice the rectangle CB, BD,
so that the square on AC alone is less than the squares
on CB, BA by twice the rectangle contained by CB, BD.
Therefore etc.

Q. E. D.

A s the text stands, this proposition is unequivocally enunciated of acuteangled triangles; and, as if to obviate any doubt as to whether the restriction
was fully intended, the enunciation speaks of the rectangle contained by one
of the sides containing the acute angle and the straight line intercepted
within by the perpendicular towards the acute angle. O n the other hand, it
