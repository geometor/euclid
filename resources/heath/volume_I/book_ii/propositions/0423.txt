Therefore the angle DBC (a right angle) is greater than the angle ABC
[1. 25], which latter is therefore acute.
It may be noted, lastly, that n. 12, 13 are supplementary to 1. 47 and
complete the theory of the relations between the squares on the sides of any
triangle, whether right-angled or not.

To construct

a square equal to a given

rectilineal

figure.

Let A be the given rectilineal figure ;
thus it is required to construct a square equal to the rectilineal
figure A.

c
D
For let there be constructed the rectangular parallelogram
BD equal to the rectilineal figure A.
[1. 45]
Then, if BE is equal to ED, that which was enjoined
will have been done ; for a square BD has been constructed
equal to the rectilineal figure A.
But, if not, one of the straight lines BE, ED is greater.
Let BE be greater, and let it be produced to F;
let EF be made equal to ED, and let BF be bisected at G.
With centre G and distance one of the straight lines GB,
GF let the semicircle BHF be described; let DE be produced
to H, and let GH be joined.
Then, since the straight line BF has been cut into equal
segments at G, and into unequal segments at E,
the rectangle contained by BE, EF together with the
square on EG is equal to the square on GF.
[11. 5]
But GF is equal to GH;
therefore the rectangle BE, EF together with the square on
GE is equal to the square on GH.
But the squares on HE,
GH;

*

EG

are equal to the square on
*

[1.47]

therefore the rectangle BE, EF together with the square on
GE is equal to the squares on HE,
EG.
Let the square on GE be subtracted from each ;
