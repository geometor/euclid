a half centuries before his time. A phrase in Simplicius' word-forword quotation from Aganis leads to the same conclusion. He speaks
of people who objected "even in ancient times" (iam antiquitus) to
the use by geometers of this postulate. This would not have been an
appropriate phrase had Geminus been the writer. I do not think
that this difficulty can be got over b y Suter's suggestion that the
passages in question may have been taken out of Heron's commentary,
and that an-Nairizi may have forgotten to name the author; it seems
clear that Simplicius is the person who described " Aganis." Hence
we are driven to suppose that Aganis was not Geminus, but some
unknown contemporary of Simplicius . Considerable interest will
however continue to attach to the comments of Simplicius so
fortunately preserved.

Proclus tells us that one Aegaeas (? Aenaeas) of Hierapolis wrote an
epitome of the Elements'; but we know nothing more of him or of it.

The above argument seems to me quite insuperable. The other arguments of Tannery
do not, however, carry conviction to my mind. I do not follow the reasoning based on
Aganis' definition of an angle. It appears to me a pure assumption that Geminus would have
seen that Posidonius' definition of parallels was not admissible. Nor does it seem to me to
count for much that Proclus, while telling us that Geminus held that the postulate ought to be
proved and warned the unwary against hastily concluding that two straight lines approaching
one another must necessarily meet (cf. a curve and its asymptote), gives no hint that
Geminus did try to prove the postulate. It may well be that Proclus omitted Geminus'
"proof" (if he wrote one) because he preferred Ptolemy's attempt which he gives
