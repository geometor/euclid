referred this theorem to Thales, inasmuch as it was necessary to
Thales' method of ascertaining the distance of ships from the shore'.
(2) Eudemus attributed to Thales the discovery of Eucl. I. 1 5 ' ,
and
(3) to Oenopides the problem of I. 23*.
(4) Eudemus referred the discovery of the theorem in I. 32 to the
Pythagoreans, and gave their proof of it, which Proclus reproduces .
(5) On 1. 44 Proclus tells us that Eudemus says that "these
things are ancient, being discoveries of the Pythagorean muse, the
application (irapalioXrj) of areas, their exceeding (\nrepfio\ri) and
their falling short (eWet^rtc)." T h e next words about the appro­
priation of these terms (parabola, hyperbola and ellipse) by later
writers (i.e. Apollonius) to denote the conic sections are of course not
due to Eudemus.
Coming now to notes where Eudemus is not named by Proclus,
we may fairly conjecture, with van Pesch, that Eudemus was really
the authority for the statements (1) that Thales first proved that a
circle is bisected by its diameter* (though the proof by reductio ad
absurdum which follows in Proclus cannot be attributed to Thales'),
(2) that " Plato made over to Leodamas the analytical method, by
means of which *'/ is recorded (iarbprrfTaC) that the latter too made
many discoveries in geometry*," (3) that the theorem of I. 5 was due
to Thales, and that for equal angles he used the more archaic
expression "similar" angles*, (4) that Oenopides first investigated
the problem of I. 12, and that he called the perpendicular the
gnomottic line (jcara yvtbpova) ', (5) that the theorem that only three
sorts of polygons can fill up the space round a point, viz. the
equilateral triangle, the square and the regular hexagon, was
Pythagorean". Eudemus may also be the authority for Proclus'
description of the two methods, referred to Plato and Pythagoras
respectively, of forming right-angled triangles in whole numbers *.
We cannot attribute to Eudemus the beginning of the note on
I. 47 where Proclus says that " i f we listen to those who like t o '
recount ancient history, we may find some of them referring this
theorem to Pythagoras and saying that he sacrificed an ox in honour
of his discovery ." A s such a sacrifice was contrary to the Pytha­
gorean tenets, and Eudemus could not have been unaware of this,
ttie story cannot rest on his authority. Moreover Proclus speaks as
though he were not certain of the correctness of the tradition ; indeed,

Cantor (Gesch. d. Math. 13, p. 221) points out the connexion between the reductio
ad
absurdum
and the analytical method said to have been discovered by Plato. Proclus gives
the proof by reductio
ad absurdum
to meet an imaginary critic who desires a
mathematical
proof; possibly Thales may have been satisfied with the argument in the same sentence
which mentions Thales, "the cause o the bisection being the unswerving course of the
straight line through the centre."
