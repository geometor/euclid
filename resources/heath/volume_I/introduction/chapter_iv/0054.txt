matical sciences into arithmetic, geometry, mechanics, astronomy,
optics, geodesy, canonic (science of musical harmony), and logistic
(apparently arithmetical problems);
(2) (in the note on the definition of a straight line) on the
classification o f lines (including curves) as simple (straight or circular)
and mixed, composite and incomposite, uniform (6p.010p.epeU) and
non-uniform (ctvopoiopepeis), lines " about solids " and lines produced
by cutting solids, including conic and spiric sections';
(3) (in the note on the definition of a plane surface) on similar
distinctions extended to surfaces and solids';
(4) (in the note on the definition of parallels) on lines which
do not meet (dcrvpytTTairoi) but which are not on that account
parallel, e.g. a curve and its asymptote, showing that the property of
not meeting- does not make lines parallel—a favourite observation of
Geminus—and, incidentally, on bounded lines or those which enclose a
figure and those which do not*;
(5) (in the same note) the definition of parallels given by
Posidonius ;
(6) on the distinction between postulates and axioms, the futility
of trying to prove axioms, as Apollonius tried to prove A x i o m I, and
the equal incorrectness of assuming what really requires proof, "as
Euclid did in the fourth postulate [equality of right angles] and in
the fifth postulate [the parallel-postulate]'" ;
(7) on Postulates I , 2, 3, which Geminus makes depend on the
idea of a straight line being described by the motion of a point*;
(8) (in the note on Postulate 5) on the inadmissibility in geometry
of an argument which is merely plausible, and the danger in this
particular case owing to the existence of lines which do converge
ad infinitum and y e t never m e e t ;
(9) (in the note on 1. 1) on the subject-matter of geometry,
theorems, problems and hiopi<rp.oi (conditions of possibility) for
problems ;
(10) (in the note on I. 5) on a generalisation of I. 5 by Geminus
through the substitution for the rectilineal base of "one uniform line
(curve)," b y means of which he proved that the only " uniform lines "

their pneumatic devices (tfav/iaToiroii'/ti)), as regards which Proclus' authority may be Pappus
(VIII. p. 1014, 14—17) who uses very similar expressions. Heron, even if not later than
Geminus, could hardly have been included in a historical work by him. Perhaps Geminus
may have referred to Ctesibius only, and Proclus may have inserted "and Heron himself.

have Geminus' own words.

"These things too we have selected from Geminus' *iXoicaMa for the elucidation of the
matters in question." Tannery (p. 27) takes these words coming at the end of the commen­
tary on the definitions as referring to the whole of the portion of the commentary dealing
with the definitions. Van Pesch properly regards them as only applying to the note on
parallels.
This seems to me clear from the use of the word too (Toeavra xof).
