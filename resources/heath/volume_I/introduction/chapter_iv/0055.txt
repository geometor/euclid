(alike in all their parts) are a straight line, a circle, and a cylindrical
helix ;
(11) (in the note on I. 10) on the question whether a line is made
up of indivisible parts (dpepif), as affecting the problem of bisecting
a given straight line ;
(12) (in the note on I. 35) on topical, or /<?<w-theorems*, where
the illustration of the equal parallelograms described between a
hyperbola and its asymptotes may also be due to Geminus .
Other passages which may fairly be attributed to Geminus, though
his name is not mentioned, are the following :
(1) in the prologue, where there is the same allusion as in the
passage (8) above to a remark of Aristotle that it is equally absurd to
expect scientific proofs from a rhetorician and to accept mere plausi­
bilities from a geometer";
(2) a passage in the prologue about the subject-matter, methods,
and bases of geometry, the latter including axioms and postulates*;
(3) another on the definition and nature of elements';
(4) a remark on the Stoic use of the term axiom for every simple
statement (wnofyavcris dirXrjY;
(5) another discussion on theorems and problems", in the middle
of which however there are some sentences by Proclus himself .
(6) another passage, in connexion with Def. 3, on lines including
or not including a figure (with which cf. part of the passage (4)
above) ;
(7) a classification of different sorts of angles according as they
are contained by simple or mixed lines (or curves) ;
(8) a similar classification of figures , and of plane figures ;
(9) Posidonius' definition of a figure™;
(10) a classification of triangles into seven kinds ;
(11) a note distinguishing lines (or curves) producible indefinitely
or not so producible, whether forming a figure or not forming a
figure (like the "single-turn spiral") ;
(12) passages distinguishing different sorts of problems , different
sorts of theorems ', and two sorts of converses (complete and partial) ;
(13) the definition of the term " p o r i s m " as used in the title of
Euclid's Porisms, as distinct from the other meaning of " corollary " ;
(14) a note on the Epicurean objection to I. 20 as being obvious
even to an a s s ;
(15) a passage on the properties of parallels, with allusions to
