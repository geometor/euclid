INTRODUCTION

[CH. IV

Apollonius' Conies, and the curves invented by Nicomedes, Hippias
and Perseus ;
(16)
a passage on the parallel-postulate regarded as the converse
of I. 17 .
Of the authors to whom Proclus was indebted in a less degree the
most important is A p o l l o n i u s of P e r g a . T w o passages allude to his
Conies', one to a work on irrationals , and two to a treatise On tfie
cochlias (apparently the cylindrical helix) by Apollonius . But more
important for our purpose are six references to Apollonius in connexion
with elementary geometry.
(1) H e appears as the author of an attempt to explain the idea
of a line (possessing length but no breadth) by reference to daily
experience, e.g. when we tell someone to measure, merely, the length
of a road or of a w a l l ; and doubtless the similar passage showing
how we may in like manner get a notion of a surface (without depth)
is his also'.
(2) He gave a new general definition of an angle .
(3) H e tried to prove certain axioms", and Proclus gives his
attempt to prove A x i o m 1, word for word .
Proclus further quotes:
(4) Apollonius' solution of the problem in Eucl. I. 10, avoiding
Euclid's use of I. 9 ,
(5) his solution of the problem in I. 1 1 , differing only slightly
from Euclid's , and
(6) his solution of the problem in I. 23 .
Heiberg conjectures that Apollonius departed from Euclid's
method in these propositions because he objected to solving problems
of a more general, by means of problems of a more particular,
character. Proclus however considers all three solutions inferior to
Euclid's; and his remarks on Apollonius' handling of these ele­
mentary matters generally suggest that he was nettled by criticisms
of Euclid in the work containing the things which he quotes from
Apollonius, just as we conclude that Pappus was offended by the
remarks of Apollonius about Euclid's incomplete treatment of the
" three- and four-line locus ." If this was the case, Proclus can hardly
have got his information about these things at second-hand; and
there seems to be no reason to doubt that he had the actual work of
Apollonius before him. This work may have been the treatise
mentioned b y Marinus in the words " Apollonius in his general
treatise" ('KiroWwvios ev TJ? xadoXov trpayfiarelay.
