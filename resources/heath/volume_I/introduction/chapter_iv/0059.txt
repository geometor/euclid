indicate that he is giving his own views. Besides indicating that he
paid more attention than his predecessors to questions requiring
deeper study (TO irpaypMreidSSes) and "pursued clear distinctions"
(TO evBiaipeTov fteTaSicoKovrai;)'—by which he appears to imply that
his predecessors had confused the different departments of their
commentaries, viz. lemmas, cases, and objections (eWTao-et?) —Proclus
complains that the earlier commentators had failed to indicate the
ultimate grounds or causes of propositions'. Although it is from
Geminus that he borrowed a passage maintaining that it is one of the
proper functions of geometry to inquire into causes (TT)I> alriav KOI
TO out T I ) , yet it is not likely that Geminus dealt with Euclid's
propositions one by one; and consequently, when we find Proclus, on
I. 8, 16, 17, 18, 32, and 47 , endeavouring to explain causes, we have
good reason to suppose that the explanations are his own.
Again, his remarks on certain things which he quotes from Pappus
can scarcely be due to anyone else, since Pappus is the latest of the
commentators whose works he appears to have used. Under this
head, come
(1) his objections to certain new axioms introduced by Pappus',
(2) his conjecture as to how Pappus came to think of his alterna­
tive proof of I. 5 ,
(3) an addition to Pappus' remarks about the curvilineal angle
which is equal to a right angle without being one*.
The defence of Geminus against Carpus, who combated his view
of theorems and problems, is also probably due to Proclus*, as well as
an observation on I. 38 to the effect that I. 35—38 are really compre­
hended in v i . 1 as particular cases .
Lastly, we can have no hesitation in attributing to Proclus himself
(1) the criticism of Ptolemy's attempt to prove the parallel-postulate",
and (2) the other attempted proof given in the same note" (on I. 29)
and assuming as an axiom that " if from one point two straight lines
forming an angle be produced ad infinitum the distance between them
when so produced ad infinitum exceeds any finite magnitude (i.e.
length)," an assumption which purports to be the equivalent of a
statement in Aristotle *. It is introduced by words in which the
writer appears to claim originality for his proof: " T o him who
desires to see this proved (KaraaKeva^opevov) let it be said by us
(Xeyecr0a> trap rjp.a>v)" etc.
Moreover, Philoponus, in a note on
Aristotle's Anal.post. I. JO, says that " the geometer (Euclid) assumes
this as an axiom, but it wants a great deal of proof, insomuch that
both Ptolemy and Proclus wrote a whole book upon it '."
