the scholia I . Nos. 40 and 49 appear with the name of Psellus
attached.
Schol. Vind. are not found without the admixture of foreign
elements in any of our three sources. In 1 there are only very few
such in the first hand. In q there are several new scholia in the first
hand, for the most part due to the copyist himself. T h e collection of
scholia on Book X . in q (Heiberg's q ) is also in the first hand ; it is
not original, and it may perhaps be due to Psellus (Maglb. has some
definitions of Book X . with a heading "scholia of... Michael Psellus
on the definitions of Euclid's 10th Element"
and Schol. X . No. 9),
whose name must have been attached to it in the common source of
Maglb. and q ; to a great extent it consists of extracts from Schol.
Vind. taken from the same source as V I . T h e scholia q (in an
ancient hand in q), confined to Book II., partly belong to Schol. Vind.
and partly correspond to b (Bologna M S . ) , q and q are in one hand
(Theodorus Antiochita), the nearest to the first hand of q ; they are
doubtless due to an early possessor of the M S . of whom we know
nothing more.

V has, besides Schol. Vind., a number of scholia which also appear
in other M S S . , one in B F b , some others in P, and some in v (Codex
Vat. 1038, 13th c.); these scholia were taken from a source in which
many abbreviations were used, as they were often misunderstood by V .
Other scholia in V which are not found in the older sources—some
appearing in V alone—are also not original, as is proved by mistakes
or corruptions which they contain; some others may be due to the
copyist himself.

V seldom has scholia common with the other older sources; for
the most part they either appear in V alone or only in the later
sources as v or F (later scholia in F), some being original, others not.
In Book X . V has three series of numerical examples, (1) with Greek
numerals, (2) alternatives added later, also mostly with Greek numerals,
(3) with Arabic numerals. T h e last class were probably the work of
the copyist himself. These examples (cf. p. 74 below) show the facility
with which the Byzantines made calculations at the date of the M S .
(12th c ) . T h e y prove also that the use of the Arabic numerals (in the
East-Arabian form) was thoroughly established in the 12th c.; they
were actually known to the Byzantines a century earlier, since they
appear, in the first hand, in an Escurial M S . of the n t h c.

Of collections in other hands in V distinguished by Heiberg (see
preface to Vol. v.), V has very few scholia which are found in other
sources, the greater part being original; V , V are the work of the
copyist himself; V are so in part only, and contain several scholia
from Schol. Vat. and other sources. V and V are later than 13th
—14th c , since they are not found in f (cod. Laurent, x x v m , 6) which
was copied from V and contains, besides V V , the greater part of
V and V I . No. 20 of V (in the text).
In P there are, besides P (a quite late hand, probably one of the
old Scriptores Graeci at the Vatican), two late hands (P ), one of
which has some new and independent scholia, while the other has
