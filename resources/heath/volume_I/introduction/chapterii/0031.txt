polated version appears in Gregory's Euclid. A n earlier and better
recension is however contained in the MS. Vindobonensis philos.
Gr. 103, though the end of the treatise, from the middle of prop. 16
to the last (18), is missing. T h e book, now edited by Menge , consists
of propositions in spheric geometry. Euclid based it on Autolycus'
work irepl Kivov/aevrit <r<\>aLpa<;, but also, evidently, on an earlier text­
book of Sphaerica of exclusively mathematical content. It has been
conjectured that the latter textbook may have been due to Eudoxus .
8. The Optics.
This book needs no description, as it has been edited by Heiberg
recently , both in its genuine form and in the recension by Theon.
The Catoptrica published by Heiberg in the same volume is not
genuine, and Heiberg suspects that in its present form it may be
Theon's. It is not even certain that Euclid wrote Catoptrica at all, as
Proclus may easily have had Theon's work before him and inadvertently
assigned it to Euclid .
9. Besides the above-mentioned works, Euclid is said to have
written the Elements of Music'' (al Kara, fiovo-cicrjv o-Totvetaio-ei?). T w o
treatises are attributed to Euclid in our MSS. of the Musici, the
KaraTOfir) Kavovoi, Sectio canonis (the theory of the intervals), and the
eltrayayr) apfxoviKj) (introduction to harmony) .
T h e first, resting on
the Pythagorean theory of music, is mathematical, and the style and
diction as well as the form of the propositions mostly agree with what
we find in the Elements. Jan thought it genuine, especially as almost
the whole of the treatise (except the preface) is quoted in extenso, and
Euclid is twice mentioned by name, in the commentary on Ptolemy's
Harmonica published by Wallis and attributed by him to Porphyry.
Tannery was of the opposite opinion'. T h e latest editor, Menge, sug­
gests that it may be a redaction by a less competent hand from the
genuine Euclidean Elements of Music.
T h e second treatise is not
Euclid's, but was written by Cleonides, a pupil of Aristoxenus .
Lastly, it is worth while to give the Arabians' list o f Euclid's
works. I take this from Suter's translation of the list of philosophers
and mathematicians in the Fihrist, the oldest authority of the kind
that we possess". " T o the writings of Euclid belong further [in
addition to the Elements']: the book of Phaenomena; the book of
