Given Magnitudes [Data]; the book of Tones, known under the name
of Music, not genuine; the book of Division, emended by Thabit;
the book of Utilisations or Applications [Porisms], not genuine; the
book of the Canon; the book of the Heavy and L i g h t ; the book of
Synthesis, not genuine; and the book of Analysis, not genuine."
It is to be observed that the Arabs already regarded the book of
Tones (by which must be meant the eirraycoyT]
app.ovi.Kr]) as spurious.
The book of Division is evidently the book on Divisions (of figures).
The next book is described by Casiri as " liber de utilitate suppositus."
Suter gives reason for believing the Porisms to be meant , but does
not apparently offer any explanation of why the work is supposed to
be spurious. T h e book of the Canon is clearly the KaraTop.}]

The book on " the Heavy and L i g h t " is apparently the tract De levi
et ponderoso, included in the Basel Latin translation of 1537, and in
Gregory's edition. T h e fragment, however, cannot safely be attributed
to Euclid, for (1) we have nowhere any mention of his having written
on mechanics, (2) it contains the notion of specific gravity in a form
so clear that it could hardly be attributed to anyone earlier than
Archimedes". Suter thinks" that the works on Analysis and Synthesis
(said to be spurious in the extract) may be further developments of
the Data or Porisms, or may be the interpolated proofs of Eucl.
XIII. 1—5, divided into analysis and synthesis, as to which see the notes
on those propositions.

Suter, op. cit. pp. 49, 50. Wenrich translated the word as " utilia." Suter says that
the nearest meaning of the Arabic word as of "porism" is use, gain (Nutzen, Gewinn), while
a further meaning is explanation, observation, addition: a gain arising out of what has
preceded (cf. Proclus' definition of the porism in the sense of a corollary).
