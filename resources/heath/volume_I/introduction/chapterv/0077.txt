Empiricus and others) indicates that Proclus had better sources than
we have; and Heiberg gives other cases where Proclus omits words
which are in all our M S S . and where Proclus' reading should perhaps
be preferred. But, except in these instances (where Proclus may have
drawn from some ancient source such as one of the older com­
mentaries), Proclus' M S . does not seem to have been among the best.
Often it agrees with our worst M S S . , sometimes it agrees with F where
F alone has a certain reading in the text, so that (e.g. in I. 15 Por.)
the common reading of Proclus and F must be rejected, thrice onlydoes it agree with P alone, sometimes it agrees with P and some
Theonine M S S . , and once it agrees with the Theonine M S S . against P
and other sources.
Of the other external sources, those which are older than Theon
generally agree with our best M S S . , e.g. Heron, allowing for the
difference in the plan of his definitions and the somewhat free adap­
tation to his purpose of the Euclidean definitions in Books X . , X I .
Heiberg concludes that the Elements were most spoiled by inter­
polations about the 3rd c, for Sextus Empiricus had a correct text,
while Iamblichus had an interpolated one; but doubtless the purer
text continued for a long time in circulation, as we conclude from the
fact that our M S S . are free from interpolations already found in
Iamblichus' M S .
