to inscribe any one of the solids in any other and (3) noted the cases
where this could not be done .
With a view to arriving at what may be called a common measure
of the Arabian tradition, it is necessary to compare, in the first place,
the numbers of propositions in the various Books. Hajl Khalfa says
that al-Hajjaj's translation contained 468 propositions, and Thabit's
478; this is stated on the authority of at-TusI, whose own edition
contained 468*. T h e fact that Thabit's version had 478 propositions
is confirmed by an index in the Bodleian M S . 279 (called O by
Klamroth). A register at the beginning of the Codex Leidensis 399, 1
which gives Ishaq's numbers (although the translation is that of
al-Hajjaj) apparently makes the total 479 propositions (the number in
Book X I V . being apparently 11, instead of the 10 of O ) . I subjoin a
table of relative numbers taken from Klamroth, to which I have added
the corresponding numbers in August's and Heiberg's editions of the
Greek text.

T h e numbers in the case of Heiberg include all propositions which
he has printed in -the t e x t ; they include therefore XIII. 6 and III. 12
now to be regarded as spurious, and X. .112—115 which he brackets
as doubtful. H e does not number the propositions in Books xiv., x v . ,
but I conclude that the numbers in P reach at least 9 in xiv., and 9
in XV.
