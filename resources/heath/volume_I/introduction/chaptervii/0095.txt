2.
Definitions.
The Arabic omits the following definitions: IV. Deff. 3—7, V I I .
Def. 9 (or io), XI. Deff. 5—7, 15, 17. 23, 25—28; but it has the
spurious definitions VI. Deff. 2, 5, and those of proportion and ordered
proportion in Book V. (Deff. 8, 19 August), and wrongly interchanges
v. Deff. 11, 12 and also VI. Deff. 3, 4.
The order of the definitions is also different in Book VII. where,
after Def. 11, the order is 12, 14, 13, 15, 16, 19, 20, 17, 18, 21, 22, 23,
and in Book XI. where the order is 1, 2, 3,4, 8, 10, 9, 13, 14,16, 12, 21,
22, 18, 19, 20, 11, 24.
3. Lemmas and
porisms.
All are omitted in the Arabic except the porisms to VI. 8, VIII. 2,
X. 3; but there are slight additions here and there, not found in the
Greek, e.g. in v m . 14, 15 (in K).
4. Alternative
proofs.
These are all omitted in the Arabic, except that in X. 105, 106 they
are substituted for the genuine proofs; but one or two alternative
proofs are peculiar to the Arabic (VI. 32 and v m . 4, 6).
The analyses and syntheses to XIII. I — 5 are also omitted in the
Arabic.
Klamroth is inclined, on a consideration of all these differences, to
give preference to the Arabian tradition over the Greek (1) "on
historical grounds," subject to the proviso that no Greek MS. as
ancient as the 8th c. is found to contradict his conclusions, which are
based generally (2) on the improbability that the Arabs would have
omitted so much if they had found it in their Greek MSS., it being clear
from the Fihrist that the Arabs had already shown an anxiety for a
pure text, and that the old translators were subjected in this matter to
the check of public criticism. Against the " historical grounds," Heiberg
is able to bring a considerable amount of evidence . First of all there
is the British Museum palimpsest (L) of the 7th or the beginning of
the 8th c. This has fragments of propositions in Book X. which are
omitted in the Arabic; the numbering of one proposition, which agrees
with the numbering in other Greek MS., is not comprehensible on
the assumption that eight preceding propositions were omitted in it,
as they are in the Arabic; and lastly, the readings in L are tolerably
like those of our MSS., and surprisingly like those of B. It is also to
be noted that, although P dates from the 10th c. only, it contains,
according to all appearance, an ante-Theonine recension.
Moreover there is positive evidence against certain omissions by
the Arabians. A t - T u s I omits VI. 12, but it is scarcely possible that,
if Eutocius had not had it, he would have quoted VI. 23 b y that
number . This quotation of V I . 23 by Eutocius also tells against
Ishaq who has the proposition as VI. 25. Again, Simplicius quotes VI.
10 by that number, whereas it is VI. 13 in Ishaq ; and Pappus quotes,
by number, XIII. 2 (Ishaq 3, 4), XIII. 4 (Ishaq 8), XIII. 16 (Ishaq 19).
