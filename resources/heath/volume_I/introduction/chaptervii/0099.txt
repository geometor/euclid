found fully noticed by Steinschneider . I shall mention here the
commentators etc. referred to in the Fihrist,
with a few others.
1. Abu '1 'Abbas al-Fadl b. Hatim a n - N a i r l z i (born at Nairiz,
died about 922) has already been mentioned .
His commentary
survives, as regards Books I . — V I . , in the Codex Leidensis 399,1, now
edited, as to four Books, by Besthorn and Heiberg, and as regards
Books 1.—x. in the Latin translation made by Gherard of Cremona
in the 12th c. and now published b y Curtze from a Cracow M S .
Its
importance lies mainly in the quotations from Heron and Simplicius.
2. Ahmad b. 'Umar a l - K a r a b i s I (date uncertain, probably 9th—
10th a), " who was among the most distinguished geometers and
arithmeticians ."
3. Al-'Abbas b. Sa'id al-Jauhari (fl. 830) was one of the astro­
nomical observers under al-Ma'mun, but devoted himself mostly to
geometry. He wrote a commentary to the whole of the
Elements,
from the beginning to the end; also the " Book of the propositions
which he added to the first book of Euclid'."

4. Muh. b. 'Isa A b u 'Abdallah a l - M a h a n i (d. between 874 and
884) wrote, according to the Fihrist,
(1) a commentary on Eucl.
Book v., (2) " O n proportion," (3) " O n the 26 propositions of the
first Book of Euclid which are proved without reductio ad
absurdum'."
The work " On proportion " survives and is probably identical with, or
part of, the commentary on Book v.
H e also wrote, what is not
mentioned by the Fihrist, a commentary on Eucl. Book X . , a fragment
of which survives in a Paris M S . '
5. Abu Ja'far al-Khazin (i.e. " the treasurer " or " librarian "), one
of the first mathematicians and astronomers of his time, was born in
Khurasan and died between the years 961 and 971. T h e
Fihrist
speaks of him as having written a commentary on the whole of the
Elements*, but only the commentary on the beginning of Book X .
survives (in Leiden, Berlin and Paris); therefore either the notes on
the rest of the Books have perished, or the Fihrist is in error . T h e
latter would seem more probable, for, at the end of his commentary,
al-Khazin remarks that the rest had already been commented on by
Sulaiman b. 'Usma (Leiden M S . ) or 'Oqba (Suter), to be mentioned
below. Al-Khazin's method is criticised unfavourably in the preface
to the Oxford M S . quoted by Nicoll (see p. 77 above).
6. A b u '1 W a f a a l - B u z j a n l (940-997), one of the greatest
Arabian mathematicians, wrote a commentary on the Elements, but
