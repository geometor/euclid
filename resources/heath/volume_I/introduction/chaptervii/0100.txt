did not complete it . His method is also unfavourably regarded in
the same preface to the Oxford M S . 280. According to Haji Khalfa, he
also wrote a book on geometrical constructions, in thirteen chapters.
Apparently a book answering to this description was compiled by a
gifted pupil from lectures by A b u '1 Wafa, and a Paris M S . (Anc. fonds
169) contains a Persian translation of this work, not that of AbO '1 Wafa
himself. A n analysis of the work was given b y Woepcke", and some
particulars will be found in Cantor .
A b u '1 Wafa also wrote a
commentary on Diophantus, as well as a separate "book of proofs
to the propositions which Diophantus used in his book and to what
he (Abu '1 Wafa) employed in his commentary ."
7. Ibn R a h a w a i h i a l - A r j a n i also commented on Eucl. Book X . '
8. ' A l l b. Ahmad A b u '1-Qasim al-Antaki (d. 987) wrote a
commentary on the whole book ; part of it seems to survive (from
the Sth Book onwards) at Oxford (Catal. MSS. orient. II. 281 ) .
9. Sind b. ' A l l A b u 't-Taiyib was a Jew who went over to
Islam in the time of al-Ma'mun, and was received among his astro­
nomical observers, whose head he became (about 830) ; he died after
864. He wrote a commentary on the whole of the Elements;
" Abu
'All saw nine books of it, and a part of the tenth*." His book " O n
the Apotomae and the Medials," mentioned by the Fihrist, may be
the same as, or part of, his commentary on Book X .
10. A b u Yusuf Ya'qub b. Muh. ar-Razi " wrote a commentary
on Book X . , and that an excellent one, at the instance of Ibn al'Amld "."
11. T h e Fihrist next mentions al-Kindi (Abu Yusuf Ya'qub b.
Ishaq b. as-Sabbah al-Kindi, d. about 873), as the author (1) of a
work " on the objects of Euclid's book," in which occurs the statement
that the Elements were originally written by Apollonius, the carpenter
(see above, p. 5 and note), (2) of a book " on the improvement of
Euclid's work," and (3) of another " on the improvement of the 14th
and 15th Books of Euclid." " H e was the most distinguished man
of his time, and stood alone in the knowledge of the old sciences
collectively; he was called ' the philosopher of the Arabians'; his
writings treat of the most different branches of knowledge, as logic,
philosophy, geometry, calculation, arithmetic, music, astronomy and
others ." Among the other geometrical works of al-Kindi mentioned
by the Fihrist * are treatises on the closer investigation of the results
of Archimedes concerning the measure of the diameter of a circle in
terms of its circumference, on the construction of the figure of the two
mean proportionals, on the approximate determination of the chords
