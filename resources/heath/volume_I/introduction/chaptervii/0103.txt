4. Treatise on " measure" after the manner of Euclid's
Elements.
5. Memoir on the solution of the difficulties in Book I.
6. Memoir for the solution of a doubt about Euclid, relative
to Book V .
7. Memoir on the solution of a doubt about the stereometric
portion.
8. Memoir on the solution of a doubt about Book xil.
9. Memoir on the division of the two magnitudes mentioned
in X . 1 (the theorem of exhaustion).
10. Commentary on the definitions in the work of Euclid
(where Steinschneider thinks that some more general expression
should be substituted for " definitions ").
The last-named work (which Suter calls a commentary on the
Postulates
of Euclid) survives in an Oxford M S . (Catal. M S S . orient.
I. 908) and in Algiers (1446, 1°).
A Leiden M S . (966) contains his Commentary "on the difficult
places " up to Book V. We do not know whether in this commentary,
which the author intended to form, with the commentary on the
Musadarat, a sort of complete commentary, he had collected the
separate memoirs on certain doubts and difficult passages mentioned
in the above list.
A commentary on Book V . and following Books found in a
Bodleian M S . (Catal. II. p. 262) with the title " Commentary on Euclid
and solution of his difficulties " is attributed to b. Haitham; this might
be a continuation of the Leiden M S .
The memoir on X . I appears to survive at St Petersburg, M S . de
l'lnstitut des Iangues orient. 192, 5° (Rosen, Catal. p. 125).
21. Ibn S T n a , known as A v i c e n n a (980-1037), wrote a Com­
pendium of Euclid, preserved in a Leiden M S . No. 1445, and forming
the geometrical portion of an encyclopaedic work embracing Logic,
Mathematics, Physics and Metaphysics .
22. Ahmad b. al-Husain a l - A h w a z i al-Katib wrote a com-,
mentary on Book x., a fragment of which (some 10 pages) is to be
found at Leiden (970), Berlin (5923) and Paris (2467, i8°) .
23.
Naslraddln a t - T u s i (1201-1274) who, as we have seen,
brought out a Euclid in two forms, wrote:
1. A treatise on the postulates of Euclid (Paris, 2467, 5 ).
2. A treatise on the 5th postulate, perhaps only a part of
the foregoing (Berlin, 5942, Paris, 2467, 6°).
3. Principles of Geometry taken from Euclid, perhaps
identical with No. I above (Florence, Pal. 298).

105 problems out of the Elements (Cairo). H e also edited
the Data (Berlin, Florence, Oxford etc.)*.
