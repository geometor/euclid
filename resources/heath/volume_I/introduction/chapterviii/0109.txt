been the same; in others Athelhard and Campanus diverge com­
pletely from R, which in these places follows the Greek text and is
therefore genuine and authoritative. In the 32nd definition occurs the
word " elinuam," the Arabic term for " rhombus," and throughout the
translation are a number of Arabic figures. But R was not translated
from the Arabic, as is shown by (among other things) its close
resemblance to the translation from Euclid given on pp. 377 sqq. of
the Gromatici
Veteres and to the so-called geometry of Boethius. T h e
explanation of the Arabic figures and the word " elinuam " in Def. 32
appears to be that R was a late copy of an earlier original with
corruptions introduced in many places ; thus in Def. 32 a part of the
text was completely lost and was supplied by some intelligent copyist
who inserted the word " elinuam," which was known to him, and also
the Arabic figures. Thus Athelhard certainly was not the first to
translate Euclid into Latin; there must have been in existence before
the n t h c. a Latin translation which was the common source of R,
the passage in the Gromatici, and " Boethius." A s in the two latter
there occur the proofs as well as the enunciations of I. 1—3, it is
possible that this translation originally contained the proofs also.
Athelhard must have had before him this translation of the
enunciations, as well as the Arabic source from which he obtained his
proofs. That some sort of translation, or at least fragments of one,
were available before Athelhard's time even in England is indicated
by some old English verses :

which would put the introduction of Euclid into England as far back
as 924-940 A . D .
We now come to the relation between Athelhard and Campanus.
That their translations were not independent, as Weissenborn would
have us believe, is clear from the fact that in all M S S . and editions,
apart from orthographical differences and such small differences as
are bound to arise when M S S . are copied by persons with some
knowledge of the subject-matter, the definitions, postulates, axioms,
and the 364 enunciations are word for word identical in Athelhard
and Campanus; and this is the case not only where both have the
same text as R but where they diverge from it. Hence it would seem
that Campanus used Athelhard's translation and only developed the
proofs by means of another redaction of the Arabian Euclid. It is
true that the difference between the proofs of the propositions in the
two translations is considerable; Athelhard's are short and com1
