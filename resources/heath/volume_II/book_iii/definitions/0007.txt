equal, or the radii of which are equal.
2. A straight line is said to t o u c h a c i r c l e which,
meeting the circle and being produced, does not cut the
circle.

3.

Circles are said to t o u c h o n e a n o t h e r which,

7.

An a n g l e of a s e g m e n t is that contained by a

straight line and a circumference of a circle.
8.
A n a n g l e in a s e g m e n t is the angle which, when
a point is taken on the circumference of the segment and
straight lines are joined from it to the extremities of the
straight line which is the b a s e of t h e s e g m e n t , is contained
by the straight lines so joined.
9. And, when the straight lines containing the angle cut
off a circumference, the angle is said to s t a n d u p o n that
circumference.
