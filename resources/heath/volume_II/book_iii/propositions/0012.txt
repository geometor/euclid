PROPOSITION

I.

To find the centre of a given circle.
Let ABC be the given circle ;
thus it is required to find the centre of the circle
Let a straight line AB
be drawn
5 through it at random, and let it be bisected
at the point D ;
from D let DC be drawn at right angles
to AB and let it be drawn through to E;
let CE be bisected at F;
10 I say that F is the centre of the circle

ABC.

c

ABC.
For suppose it is not, but, if possible,
let G be the centre,
and let GA, GD, GB be joined.
15
Then, since AD is equal to DB,
and DG is common,
BD,

the two sides AD,
DG respectively;

and the base GA
20 radii;

DG

E

are equal to the two sides

is equal to the base GB,

for they are

therefore the angle ADG is equal to the angle GDB. [1. 8 ]
But, when a straight line set up on a straight line makes
the adjacent angles equal to one another, each of the equal
angles is right;
[1. Def. 1 0 ]
25
therefore the angle GDB is right.
