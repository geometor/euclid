PROPOSITION

3.

If in a circle a straight line through the centre bisect a
straight line not through the centre, it also cuts it at right
angles ; and if it cut it at right angles, it also bisects it.
Let ABC
be a circle, and in it let a straight line
through the centre bisect a straight line
AB not through the centre at the point

CD

c

F;
I say that it also cuts it at right angles.
For let the centre of the circle
be taken, and let it be E; let EA,
be joined.
Then, since AF is equal to FB,
and EE

ABC
EB
A

is common,

two sides are equal to two sides ;
and the base EA

is equal to the base

EB;

therefore the angle AFE is equal to the angle BEE. [ 1 . 8 ]
But, when a straight line set up on a straight line makes
the adjacent angles equal to one another, each of the equal
angles is right;
[1. Def. 1 0 ]
therefore each of the angles AFE, BEE is right.
Therefore CD, which is through the centre, and bisects
AB which is not through the centre, also cuts it at right
angles.
Again, let CD cut AB

at right angles ;

I say that it also bisects it, that is, that AFis

equal to FB.
