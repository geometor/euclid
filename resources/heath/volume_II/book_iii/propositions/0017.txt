For, with the same construction,
since EA is equal to EB,
the angle EAF is also equal to the angle EBF.
[i. 5 ]
But the right angle AFE is equal to the right angle BFE,
30 therefore EAF, EBF are two triangles having two angles
equal to two angles and one side equal to one side, namely
EE, which is common to them, and subtends one of the equal
angles;
therefore they will also have the remaining sides equal to
35 the remaining sides;
[1. 2 6 ]
therefore AF\s
equal to FB.
Therefore etc.

If in a circle two straight lines cut one another which are
not through the centre, they do not bisect one another.
Let ABCD be a circle, and in it let the two straight lines
AC, BD, which are not through the
centre, cut one another at E;
I say that they do not bisect one
another.
For, if possible, let them bisect one
another, so that AE
is equal to EC,
and BE to ED ;
let the centre of the circle ABCD
taken [ i u . 1 ] , and let it be F; let FE
joined.

Then, since a straight line FE through the centre bisects
a straight line AC not through the centre,
it also cuts it at right angles ;
therefore the angle FEA

[in. 3 ]

is right.

Again, since a straight line FE bisects a straight line
it also cuts it at right angles ;
therefore the angle FEB

is right.
