But the angle FEA was also proved right;
therefore the angle FEA
is equal to the angle
the less to the greater : which is impossible.

Therefore AC, BD do not bisect one another.

PROPOSITION

5.

If two circles cut one another, they will not have the same
centre.
For let the circles ABC,
points B, C;

CDG

cut one another at the

I say that they will not have the same
centre.
For, if possible, let it be E\ let EC
be joined, and let EFG
be drawn
through at random.
Then, since the point E is the
centre of the circle
ABC,
EC is equal to EE. [i. Def. 1 5 ]
Again, since the point E is the centre of the circle
EC is equal to

CDG,

EG.

But EC was proved equal to EF also ;
therefore EF is also equal to EG,
greater : which is impossible.
Therefore the point E

the less to the

is not the centre of the circles

ABC, CDG.
Therefore etc.

two circles have the same centre and one point in their circumferences common,
they must coincide
altogether.
