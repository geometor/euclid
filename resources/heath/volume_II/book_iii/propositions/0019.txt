If two circles touch one another, they will not have the
same centre.
For let the two circles ABC,
at the point C;

CDE

I say that they will not have
same centre.

the

touch one another

For, if possible, let it be F; let
FC be joined, and let FEB be drawn
through at random.
Then, since the point F is the
centre of the circle ABC,
FC is equal to FB.
Again, since the point F is the
centre of the circle CDE,
FC is equal to

FE.

But FC was proved equal to FB ;
therefore FE is also equal to FB, the less to the greater:
which is impossible.
Therefore F is not the centre of the circles ABC,

CDE.

Therefore etc.
