If on the diameter of a circle a point be taken which is not
the centre of the circle, and from the point straight lines fall
upon the circle, that will be greatest on which the centre is, th
remainder of the same diameter will be least, and of the rest
5 the nearer to the straight line through the centre is always
greater than the more remote, and only two equal straight
lines will fall from the point on the circle, one on each side
of the least straight line.
Let ABCD be a circle, and let AD be a diameter of it;
10 on AD let a point F be taken which is not the centre of the
circle, let E be the centre of the circle,
and from F let straight lines FB, FC, FG fall upon the circle

ABCD;
I say that FA is greatest, FD is least, and of the rest FB
15 greater than FC, and FC than FG.
For let BE, CE, GE be joined.
Then, since in any triangle two
sides are greater than the remaining
one,
[1. 20]

EB, EF are greater than BE.
But AE is equal to BE ;
therefore AF is greater than BE.
Again, since BE is equal to CE,
and FE is common,
25 the two sides BE, EF are equal to the two sides CE,
But the angle BEF is also greater than the angle
therefore the base BF is greater than the base CF.
For the same reason

is

EF.
CEF;
[1. 24]

CF is also greater than FG.
Again, since OF, FE are greater than EG,
and EG is equal to ED,
GF, FE are greater than
Let EF be subtracted from each ;

ED.

therefore the remainder GF is greater than the remainder

3sFD.
Therefore FA is greatest, FD is least, and FB is greater
than FC, and FC than FG.
