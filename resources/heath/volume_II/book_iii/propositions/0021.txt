I say also that from the point F only two equal straight
lines will fall on the circle ABCD, one on each side of the
4° least FD.
For on the straight line EF, and at the point £ on it, let
the angle FEN be constructed equal to the angle GEF [i. 2 3 ] ,
and let FH be joined.
Then, since GE is equal to EH,
45 and EF is common,
the two sides GE, EF are equal to the two sides HE,
EF;
and the angle GEF is equal to the angle
HEF;
therefore the base FG is equal to the base FH.
[1. 4 ]
I say again that another straight line equal to FG will no;
5° fall on the circle from the point F.
For, if possible, let FK so fall.
Then, since FK is equal to FG, and FH to FG,
FK is also equal to FH,
the nearer to the straight line through the centre being
55 thus equal to the more remote : which is impossible.
Therefore another straight line equal to GF will not fall
from the point F upon the circle ;
therefore only one straight line will so fall.
Therefore etc.
Q. E. D.
4. of the same diameter. I have inserted these words for clearness' sake. The text
has simply Aaxkrn; & q X W T T J , " and the remaining (straight line) least."
7, 39. one on each side. The word " one' is not in the Greek, but is necessary to
give the force of i<t> hdrepa rrp l\axL V*, literally " on both sides," or " on each of the two
sides, of the least."

D e M o r g a n p o i n t s o u t t h a t t h e r e is a n u n p r o v e d a s s u m p t i o n in this
d e m o n s t r a t i o n . W e draw straight lines from F, a s FB, FC, s u c h t h a t t h e
angle DFB is g r e a t e r t h a n t h e angle DFC a n d t h e n a s s u m e , with respect t o
t h e straight lines d r a w n from the centre E t o B, C, t h a t
t h e angle DEB is greater t h a n t h e angle DEC.
This
is m o s t easily p r o v e d , I think, by m e a n s of t h e c o n v e r s e
of part of t h e t h e o r e m a b o u t t h e l e n g t h s of different
straight lines d r a w n t o a given straight line from a n
external point which was m e n t i o n e d a b o v e in t h e n o t e
o n III. 2. T h i s c o n v e r s e would b e t o t h e effect that, If
two unequal straight lines be drawn from a point to a
given straight line which are not perpendicular
to the
straight line, the greater of the two is the further from the perpendicular from the
point to the given straight line. T h i s c a n either b e p r o v e d from its c o n v e r s e by
