the nearer to that through the centre is always greater than
the more remote, but, of the straight lines falling on the convex
circumference, that between the point and the diameter is least,
while of the rest the nearer to the least is always less than the
more remote, and only two equal straight lines will fall on the
circle from the point, one on each side of the least.
Let ABC be a circle, and let a point D be taken outside
ABC;
let there be drawn through
from it straight lines DA, DE,
DE,
DC, and let DA be through the centre;
I say that, of the straight lines falling

on the concave circumference A EEC,

the straight line DA through the centre

is greatest,

but, of the straight lines falling on the
convex circumference HLKG,
the

straight line DG between the point

and the diameter AG is least; and

the nearer to the least DG is always
less than the more remote, namely DK
than DL, and DL than DH.
For let the centre of the circle ABC be taken [m. i ] , and
let it be M; let ME, ME, MC, MK, ML, MH be joined.
Then, since AM is equal to EM,
let MD be added to each ;
therefore AD is equal to EM,
MD.
But EM, MD are greater than ED;
[i. 20]
therefore AD is also greater than ED.
Again, since ME is equal to ME,
and MD is common,
therefore EM, MD are equal to EM,
MD;

and the angle EMD is greater than the angle FMD ;
therefore the base ED is greater than the base FD.
[1. 2 4 ]

Similarly we can prove that FD is greater than CD;
therefore DA is greatest, while DE is greater than DE,
and DF than DC.
