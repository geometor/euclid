Next, since MK,
and MG is equal to

8

KD are greater than MD,
MK,

therefore the remainder KD

19

[1. 20]

is greater than the remainder

GD,
so that GD is less than KD.
And, since on MD, one of the sides of the triangle MLD,
two straight lines MK, KD were constructed meeting within
the triangle,
therefore MK, KD are less than ML, LD;
[1. 2 1 ]
and MK

is equal to ML ;

therefore the remainder DK

is less than the remainder

DL.
Similarly we can prove that DL is also less than DH;
therefore DG is least, while DK is less than DL, and
DL than DH.
I say also that only two equal straight lines will fall from
the point D on the circle, one on each side of the least DG.
On the straight line MD, and at the point M on it,
let the angle DMB be constructed equal to the angle
KMD,
and let DB be joined.
Then, since MK is equal to MB,
and MD is common,
the two sides KM, MD are equal to the two sides BM,
MD respectively;
and the angle KMD is equal to the angle
BMD;
therefore the base DK is equal to the base DB.
[1. 4 ]
I say that no other straight line equal to the straight line
DK will fall on the circle from the point D.
For, if possible, let a straight line so fall, and let it be

DN.

Then, since DK is equal to DN,
while DK is equal to DB,
DB is also equal to DN,
that is, the nearer to the least DG equal to the more remote:
which was proved impossible.
Therefore no more than two equal straight lines will fall
on the circle ABC from the point D, one on each side of
DG the least.
Therefore etc.
