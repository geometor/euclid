As D e M o r g a n p o i n t s out, t h e r e are here two a s s u m p t i o n s similar t o
t h a t tacitly m a d e in t h e proof of ill. 7, n a m e l y t h a t
K falls within t h e triangle DLM
a n d E outside
t h e triangle DFM.
T h e s e facts can b e p r o v e d
in t h e s a m e way as t h e a s s u m p t i o n in III. 7. L e t
DE
m e e t FM in Y a n d LM in Z.
T h e n , as
before, MZ is less t h a n ML a n d therefore t h a n
MK.
T h e r e f o r e K lies further t h a n Z from
t h e foot of t h e p e r p e n d i c u l a r from M o n
DE.
Similarly E lies further t h a n Y from t h e foot of t h e
same perpendicular.
H e r o n d e a l s with lines o n opposite sides of t h e
d i a m e t e r t h r o u g h t h e external p o i n t in a m a n n e r similar t o that a d o p t e d in
his previous n o t e .
F o r t h e case where E, F are t h e second p o i n t s in
w h i c h AE, AF m e e t t h e circle t h e m e t h o d answers
well e n o u g h .
If AE is nearer the centre D t h a n AF'is,
and

sqs. o n DG,

GE = sqs. o n DH,

HF

sqs. o n DG,

GA = sqs. o n DH,

HA,

whence, since
it follows t h a t
and
so that, b y a d d i t i o n ,

DG < DH,
GE > HF,
AG>
AH,
AE > AF-

But, if K, L b e t h e p o i n t s in w h i c h AE, AF first
m e e t t h e circle, t h e m e t h o d fails, a n d H e r o n is r e d u c e d t o proving, in t h e first
i n s t a n c e , t h e p r o p e r t y usually d e d u c e d from i n . 3 6 . H e a r g u e s t h u s :
AKD b e i n g a n o b t u s e angle,
sq. o n AD = s u m of sqs. on AK, KD a n d twice rect. AK, KG. [11. 1 2 ]
ALD is also a n o b t u s e angle, a n d it follows t h a t
s u m of sqs. o n AK, KD a n d twice rect. AK, KG is equal t o
s u m of sqs. o n AL, LD a n d twice rect. AL,
LH.
T h e r e f o r e , t h e squares o n KD, LD b e i n g equal,
sq o n AK and twice rect. AK, KG = sq. o n AL a n d twice rect. AL,
LH,
or
sq o n AK and rect. AK, KE = sq. o n AL a n d rect. AL, LF,
i.e.
rect. AK, AE = rect. AL, AF.
B u t , b y t h e first part,
AE > AF.
Therefore

i n . 7, 8 d e a l with t h e lengths of t h e several lines d r a w n to t h e circum­
ference of a circle ( 1 ) from a point within it, ( 2 ) from a p o i n t o u t s i d e i t ; but a
similar p r o p o s i t i o n is t r u e of straight lines d r a w n from a p o i n t o n t h e
c i r c u m f e r e n c e itself: If any point be taken on the circumference of a circle,
then, of all the straight lines which can be drawn from it to the circumference, the
greatest is that in which the centre is ; of any others that which is nearer to the
straight line which passes through the centre is greater than one more remote;
and from the same point there can be drawn to the circumference two straight
lines, and only two, which are equal to one another, one on each side of the
greatest line.
