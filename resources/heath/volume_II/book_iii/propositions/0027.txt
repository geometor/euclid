PROPOSITION

9.

If a point be taken within a circle, and more than two
equal straight lines fall from the point on the circle, the point
taken is the centre of the circle.
Let ABC be a circle and D a point within it, and from
D let more than two equal straight
lines, namely DA, DB, DC, fall on
the circle ABC;
I say that the point D is the centre
of the circle ABC.
For let AB, BC be joined and
bisected at the points E, F, and let
ED, FD be joined and drawn through
to the points G, K, H, L.
Then, since AE is equal to EB,
and ED is common,
the two sides AE,
and the base DA

ED are equal to the two sides BE, ED ;

is equal to the base

therefore the angle A ED

DB;

is equal to the angle

BED.
[1. 8 ]

Therefore each of the angles A ED, BED

is right;
[1. Def. 1 0 ]

therefore GK
angles.

cuts AB

into two equal parts and at right

And since, if in a circle a straight line cut a straight line
into two equal parts and at right angles, the centre of the
circle is on the cutting straight line,
[lit 1, P o r . ]
the centre of the circle is on GK.
