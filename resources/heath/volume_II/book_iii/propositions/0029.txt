PROPOSITION

IO.

A circle does not cut a circle at more points than two.
For, if possible, let the circle ABC
at more points than two, namely

cut the circle

DEF

B, C, F, H;
let BH, BG be joined and
bisected at the points K, L,
and from K, L let KC, LM be
drawn at right angles to BH,
BG and carried through to the
points A, E.
Then, since in the circle
ABC a straight line AC cuts a
straight line BH into two equal
parts and at right angles,
the centre of the circle ABC

is on A C.

[m. i , Por.]

Again, since in the same circle ABC a straight line NO
cuts a straight line BG into two equal parts and at right
angles,
the centre of the circle ABC is on NO.
But it was also proved to be on AC, and the straight
lines AC, NO meet at no point except at P;
therefore the point P is the centre of the circle ABC.
Similarly we can prove that P is also the centre of the
circle DEF;
therefore the two circles ABC, DEF which cut one
another have the same centre P: which is impossible, [ i n . 5]
Therefore etc.

1 . The word circle (*IM\OS) is here employed in the unusual sense of the circumference
(rcpuptpcia) of a circle. Cf. note on I . Def. I G .
