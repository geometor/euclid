PROPOSITION

II.

If two circles touch one another internally, and their centres
be taken, the straight line joining their centres, if it be also
produced, will fall on the point of contact of the circles.
For let the two circles ABC, ADE
internally at the point A, and let
the centre F of the circle ABC, and
the centre G of ADE, be taken ;
I say that the straight line joined
from G to F and produced will fall
on A.

touch one another

For suppose it does not, but,
if possible, let it fall as FGH, and
let AF, AG be joined.
Then, since AG, GFare greater
than FA, that is, than FN,
let FG be subtracted from each;
therefore the remainder AG

GH.

is greater than the remainder
