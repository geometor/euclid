I say that the straight line joined from F to G will pass
through the point of contact at A.
1 0

For suppose it does not,
but, if possible, let it pass as

b

FCDG, and let AF, AG be
joined.
Then, since the point F is
the centre of the circle ABC,
is
FA is equal to FC.
Again, since the point G is
the centre of the circle
ADE,
GA is equal to GD.
But FA was also proved equal to FC;
20
therefore FA, AG are equal to FC, GD,
so that the whole FG is greater than FA,
but it is also less [1. 20] • which is impossible.

AG;

Therefore the straight line joined from F to G will not
fail to pass through the point of contact at A ;
S
therefore it will pass through it.
Therefore etc.
