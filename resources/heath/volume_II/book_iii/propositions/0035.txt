externally at A and B A C is drawn through A cutting both circles and
containing
the centre of one, B A C will also contain the centre of the other.

M r H . M . T a y l o r gets over t h e difficulties i n v o l v e d by III. 1 1 , 1 2 in a
m a n n e r which is most i n g e n i o u s b u t n o t E u c l i d e a n . H e first p r o v e s t h a t , if two
circles meet at a point not in the same straight line with their centres, the circles
intersect at that point; this is very easily e s t a b l i s h e d by m e a n s of ill, 7, 8 a n d
t h e t h i r d similar t h e o r e m . T h e n h e gives as a corollary t h e s t a t e m e n t t h a t , if
two circles touch, the point of contact is in the same straight line with
their
centres.
I t is n o t e x p l a i n e d how this is inferred from t h e s u b s t a n t i v e
p r o p o s i t i o n ; it s e e m s , however, t o b e a logical inference simply.
By t h e
proposition, every A (circles m e e t i n g a t a p o i n t n o t in t h e s a m e straight line
with t h e c e n t r e ) is B (circles which i n t e r s e c t ) ; therefore every not-2? is n o t - ^ ,
i.e. circles which d o n o t intersect d o n o t m e e t a t a p o i n t n o t in t h e s a m e
straight line with t h e c e n t r e s . N o w n o n - i n t e r s e c t i n g circles m a y e i t h e r m e e t
(i.e. t o u c h ) or n o t meet. I n t h e former c a s e t h e y m u s t m e e t on t h e line of
c e n t r e s : for, if they m e t at a p o i n t n o t in t h a t line, t h e y w o u l d intersect. B u t
s u c h a purely logical inference is foreign t o E u c l i d ' s m a n n e r .
As De Morgan
says, " E u c l i d m a y h a v e b e e n i g n o r a n t of t h e i d e n t i t y of ' E v e r y X is Y' a n d
' E v e r y not- Y is not-A",' for a n y t h i n g t h a t a p p e a r s in his w r i t i n g s ; h e m a k e s
t h e o n e follow from t h e o t h e r by a n e w proof e a c h t i m e " ( q u o t e d in K e y n e s '
Formal Logic, p . 8 1 ) .
T h e r e is n o difficulty in proving, by m e a n s of 1. 20, M r T a y l o r ' s n e x t
proposition that, if two circles meet at a point which lies in the same
straight
line as their centres and is between the centres, the circles touch at that point, and
each circle lies without the other.
