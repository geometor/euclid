3. If the distance between the centres of two circles is equal to the sum of the
radii, the two circumferences have one point common and one only, and that point
is on the line of centres.
Each circle is external to the other.
L e t O, O b e t h e c e n t r e s , r, r t h e radii of t h e circles, so t h a t OO is e q u a l
to r*- r.
T h u s OO is g r e a t e r t h a n r, s o t h a t O
is external t o t h e circle O, a n d t h e c i r c u m ­
ference of t h e circle O c u t s OO in a
p o i n t A.
A n d , since OO is e q u a l t o r + r', a n d
OA to r, it follows t h a t OA is e q u a l t o r,
so t h a t A b e l o n g s also t o t h e c i r c u m f e r e n c e
of t h e circle O.
T h e proof t h a t all o t h e r p o i n t s o n , a n d
all p o i n t s within, t h e c i r c u m f e r e n c e of t h e circle O a r e e x t e r n a l t o t h e circle O
follows t h e similar proof of p r o p . 1 a b o v e . A n d similarly all p o i n t s ( e x c e p t A)

T h e two circles, h a v i n g o n e c o m m o n p o i n t only, touch a t t h a t point, w h i c h

4. If the distance between the centres of two unequal circles is equal to the
difference between the radii, the two circumferences have one point and me only in
common, and that point lies on the line of centres.
The lesser circle is within the
other.
T h e proof is t h a t of p r o p . 2 a b o v e , mutatis
mutandis.
T h e circles h e r e t o u c h internally a t t h e p o i n t o n t h e line of c e n t r e s .
5. If the distance between the centres of two circles is less than the sum, and
greater than the difference, of the radii, the two circumferences have two common
points symmetrically
situated with respect to the line of centres but not lying on
that line.
L e t O, O b e t h e c e n t r e s of t h e two circles, r, r t h e i r radii, r b e i n g t h e
greater, so t h a t
r - r < 0 O
<r+r .

An arc of a circle which has one extremity within and the other without a
given circle has one point common with the
latter and only one; from which it follows,
if we c o n s i d e r two s u c h arcs m a k i n g a
c o m p l e t e circumference, t h a t , if a circum­
ference of a circle passes through one point
internal to, and one point external to a
given circle, it cuts the latter circle in two
points.
