therefore BG is greater than HD ;
therefore BH is much greater than HD.
Again, since the point / / is the centre of the circle

EBFD,
<o

BH is equal to HD ;
but it was also proved much greater than it: which is
impossible.
Therefore a circle does not touch a circle internally at
more points than one.

I say further that neither does it so touch it externally.
For, if possible, let the circle ACK
touch the circle
ABDC at more points than one, namely A, C,
and let AC be joined.
Then, since on the circumference of each of the circles

\oABDC, ACK two points A, C have been taken at random,
the straight line joining the points
circle;

will fall within each
[ni, 2 ]

but it fell within the circle ABCD and outside ACK
[m. Def. 3]: which is absurd,
is
Therefore a circle does not touch a circle externally at
more points than one.
And it was proved that neither does it so touch it
internally.
Therefore etc.

T h e difficulties which h a v e b e e n felt in regard t o t h e proofs of this

Euclid's proof of t h e first p a r t of t h e p r o p o s i t i o n differs from S i m s o n ' s ;

passes t h r o u g h a p o i n t of c o n t a c t . B u t , b y t h e s a m e a r g u m e n t a s t h a t given
