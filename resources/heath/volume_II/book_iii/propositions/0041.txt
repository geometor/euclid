and let it be E; from E let EF, EG be drawn perpendicular
to AB, CD, and let AE, EC be joined.
Then, since a straight line EF through
the centre cuts a straight line AB not through
the centre at right angles, it also bisects it.
[HI. 3 ]

Therefore AF

is equal to

FB;

therefore AB

is double of

AF.

For the same reason
CD is also double of CG;
and AB

is equal to CD ;

therefore AFis

also equal to CG.

And, since -^-fi" is equal to

EC,

the square on AE is also equal to the square on EC.
But the squares on AF, EF are equal to the square on AE,
for the angle at F is right;
and the squares on EG, GC are equal to the square on EC,
for the angle at G is right;
[1. 4 7 ]
therefore the squares on AF, FE are equal to the
squares on CG, GE,
of which the square on AF is equal to the square on CG,
for AFis equal to CG ;
therefore the square on FE which remains is equal to
the square on EG,
therefore EF is equal to EG.
But in a circle straight lines are said to be equally distant
from the centre when the perpendiculars drawn to them from
the centre are equal;
[in. Def. 4 ]
therefore AB,

CD are equally distant from the centre.

Next, let the straight lines AB, CD be equally distant
from the centre; that is, let EF be equal to EG.
I say that AB is also equal to CD.
For, with the same construction, we can prove, similarly,
that AB is double of AF, and CD of CG.
And, since AE is equal to CE,
the square on AE is equal to the square on CE.
But the squares on EF, FA are equal to the square on AE,
and the squares on EG, GC equal to the square on CE. [1. 4 7 ]
