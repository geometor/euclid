Therefore the squares on EF,

for EF is equal to EG ;

is equal to the square on

EG,

therefore the square on AF
square on CG;

which remains is equal to the

therefore AFis equal to CG.
And AB is double of AF, and CD double of CG;
therefore AB is equal to CD.

PROPOSITION

Of straight lines in a circle the diameter is greatest,
and of the rest the nearer to the centre is always greater than
the more remote.
Let ABCD be a circle, let AD be its diameter and E
the centre; and let BC be nearer to the
diameter AD, and FG more remote ;
I say that AD
is greatest and BC
greater than FG.
For from the centre E let EH,
EK
be drawn perpendicular to BC, FG.
Then, since BC is nearer to the
centre and FG more remote, EK
is
greater than EH.
[ m . Def. 5 ]
Let EL
be made equal to
EH,
through L let LM be drawn at right
angles to EK and carried through to N, and let ME,
FE, EG be joined.
Then, since EH is equal to EL,
BC is also equal to MN.
Again, since AE

is equal to EM,

AD

is equal to ME,

and ED to
EN.
