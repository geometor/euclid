therefore AD

is greater than BC.

And, since the two sides ME,
sides FE,
EG,
and the angle MEN

BC;
EN

are equal to the two

greater than the angle

therefore the base MN

FEG,

is greater than the base EG.

But MN was proved equal to BC.
Therefore the diameter AD is greatest and BC greater
than EG.
Therefore etc.
Q. E. D.
1. Of straight lines. The Greek leaves these words to be understood.
5. Nearer to the diameter A D . As BC, FG are not in general parallel to AD,
Euclid should have said " nearer to the centre."

PROPOSITION

16.

The straight line drawn at right angles to the diameter
of a circle from its extremity will fall outside the circle, and
into the space between the straight line and the circumference
another straight line cannot be interposed; further the angle
of the semicircle is greater, and the remaining angle less, than
any acute rectilineal angle.
Let ABC
diameter;

be a circle about D

as centre and AB
