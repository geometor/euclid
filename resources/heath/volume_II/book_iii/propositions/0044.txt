I say that the straight line drawn from A
to AB from its extremity will fall
outside the circle.

at right angles

For suppose it does not, but,
if possible, let it fall within as CA
and let DC be joined.

Since DA is equal to DC,
the angle DA C is also equal to
the angle A CD.

But the angle DA C is right;
therefore the angle A CD is also right:
thus, in the triangle A CD, the two angles DAC,
equal to two right angles : which is impossible.

A CD are

Therefore the straight line drawn from the point A at
right angles to BA will not fall within the circle.
Similarly we can prove that neither will it fall on the
circumference;
therefore it will fall outside.
Let it fall as AE;
I say next that into the space between the straight line A E
and the circumference CHA another straight line cannot be
interposed.
For, if possible, let another straight line be so interposed,
as FA, and let DG be drawn from the point D perpendicular
to FA.
Then, since the angle AGD is right,
and the angle DAG is less than a right angle,
AD is greater than DG.

But DA is equal to DH;
therefore DH is greater than DG,
greater : which is impossible.

Therefore another straight line cannot be interposed into
the space between the straight line and the circumference.
I say further that the angle of the semicircle contained by
the straight line BA and the circumference CHA is greater
than any acute rectilineal angle,
and the remaining angle contained by the circumference CHA
and the straight line AE is less than any acute rectilineal angle.
For, if there is any rectilineal angle greater than the
angle contained by the straight line BA and the circumference
