by the circumference CHA and the straight line AE, then
into the space between the circumference and the straight line
AE a. straight line will be interposed such as will make an
angle contained by straight lines which is greater than the
angle contained by the straight line BA and the circumference
CHA, and another angle contained by straight lines which
is less than the angle contained by the circumference
CHA
and the straight line AE.
But such a straight line cannot be interposed ;
therefore there will not be any acute angle contained by
straight lines which is greater than the angle contained by
the straight line BA and the circumference CHA, nor yet
any acute angle contained by straight lines which is less than
the angle contained by the circumference CHA
and the
straight line
AE.—
PORISM. • From this it is manifest that the straight line
drawn at right angles to the diameter of a circle from its
extremity touches the circle.

Q. E. D.

cannot be interposed, literally " will not fall in between " (oi irapepwe<ruTtu).

T h i s proposition is historically interesting b e c a u s e of t h e controversies t o
which t h e last p a r t of it gave rise from t h e 1 3 t h t o t h e 1 7 t h c e n t u r i e s .
History was here r e p e a t i n g itself, for it is certain that, in a n c i e n t G r e e c e , b o t h
before a n d after E u c l i d ' s time, t h e r e h a d b e e n a g r e a t d e a l of t h e s a m e sort
of c o n t e n t i o n a b o u t t h e n a t u r e of t h e " a n g l e of a s e m i c i r c l e " a n d t h e

h a d a recognised n a m e , MpaToeiSijs ywvta, horn-like o r cornicular
angle;
t h o u g h this t e r m d o e s n o t a p p e a r in Euclid, it is often u s e d by P r o c l u s ,
evidently a s a t e r m well u n d e r s t o o d . While it is from P r o c l u s t h a t w e get t h e
best idea of t h e a n c i e n t controversies o n this subject, we may, I t h i n k , infer
their p r e v a l e n c e in E u c l i d ' s t i m e from this solitary a p p e a r a n c e of t h e t w o
" a n g l e s " in t h e Elements.
A l o n g with t h e definition of t h e a n g l e of a
segment, it seems, t o show that, a l t h o u g h t h e s e angles a r e only m e n t i o n e d t o

a subject which t h e g e o m e t e r s of his t i m e r e g a r d e d with interest.
I f this
conjecture is right, t h e m e n t i o n of t h e s e angles w o u l d c o r r e s p o n d t o t h e
insertion of definitions of which h e m a k e s n o u s e , e.g. t h o s e of a r h o m b u s a n d
