From a given point to draw a straight line touching a
given circle.
Let A be the given point, and BCD the given circle ;
thus it is required to draw from the point A a straight line
touching the circle BCD.
For let the centre E of the circle
be taken ;
[MI. I ]
let AE be joined, and with centre E
and distance EA let the circle AFG
be described ;
from D let DF be drawn at right
angles to EA,
and let EF, AB be joined ;
I say that AB has been drawn from
the point A touching the circle BCD.
For, since E is the centre of the circles BCD,
AFG,
EA is equal to EF, and ED to EB ;
therefore the two sides AE, EB are equal to the two sides

FE, ED:
and they contain a common angle, the angle at E;
therefore the base DF is equal to the base AB,
and the triangle DEF is equal to the triangle BE A,
and the remaining angles to the remaining angles ; [1. 4]
therefore the angle EDF is equal to the angle
EBA.
But the angle EDF is right;
therefore the angle EBA is also right.
Now EB is a radius ;
and the straight line drawn at right angles to the diameter
of a circle, from its extremity, touches the circle ; [m. 16, Por.]
therefore AB touches the circle BCD.
Therefore from the given point A the straight line AB
has been drawn touching the circle BCD.
