PROPOSITION

18.

If a straight line touch a circle, and a straight line be
joined from the centre to the point of contact, the straight line
so joined will be perpendicular to the tangent.
For let a straight line DE touch the circle ABC
point C, let the centre F of the
circle ABC be taken, and let FC
be joined from F to C;
I say that FC is perpendicular to

at the

DE.
For, if not, let FG be drawn
from F perpendicular to DE.
Then, since the angle FGC is
right,
the angle FCG is acute; [1. 1 7 ]
and the greater angle is subtended
by the greater side ;

[1. 1 9 ]

therefore FC is greater than FG.
But FC is equal to FB ;
therefore FB is also greater than FG,
the less than the greater: which is impossible.
Therefore FG is not perpendicular to

DE.

Similarly we can prove that neither is any other straight
line except EC;
therefore FC is perpendicular to

DE.

Therefore etc.
