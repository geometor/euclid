PROPOSITION

I 9.

If a straight line touch a circle, and from the point of
contact a straight line be drawn at right angles to the tangent,
the centre of the circle will be on the straight line so drawn.
For let a straight line DE touch the circle ABC
point C, and from C let CA be
drawn at right angles to DE;
I say that the centre of the circle
is on A C.
For suppose it is not, but, if
possible, let F be the centre,
and let CF be joined.
Since a straight line DE touches
the circle ABC,
and FC has been joined from the
centre to the point of contact,

e

FC is perpendicular to DE ;
[lit 1 8 ]
therefore the angle FCE is right.
But the angle A CE is also right;
therefore the angle FCE is equal to the angle A CE,
the less to the greater: which is impossible.
Therefore F is not the centre of the circle A BC.
Similarly we can prove that neither is any other point
except a point on A C.
Therefore etc.
