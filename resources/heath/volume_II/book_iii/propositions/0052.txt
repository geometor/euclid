PROPOSITION

20.

In a circle the angle at the centre is double of the angle
at the circumference, when the angles have the same circum­
ference as base.
Let ABC be a circle, let the angle BEC
sat its centre, and the angle BAC an
angle at the circumference, and let
them have the same circumference BC
as base;
I say that the angle BEC
10 the angle BAC.

is double of

be an angle

A/

For let AE be joined and drawn
through to F.
Then, since EA is equal to EB,
the angle EAB is also equal to the
is
angle EBA ;
[1. 5 ]
therefore the angles EAB,
EBA
are double of the angle

EAB.
But the angle BEE

is equal to the angles EAB,

EBA

;

[>• 3 2 ]

therefore
20

the

angle

BEE

is

also double

of

the

angle

EAB.
For the same reason

the angle EEC is also double of the angle EA C.
Therefore the whole angle BEC is double of the whole
angle BAC.

Again let another straight line be inflected, and let there
be another angle BDC;
let DE be joined and produced
to G.
