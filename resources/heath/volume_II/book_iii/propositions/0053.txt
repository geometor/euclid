Similarly then we can prove that the angle GEC is
double of the angle EDC,

of which the angle GEB is double of the angle EDB ;
therefore the angle BEC
angle BDC.
Therefore etc.

' 15. let a n o t h e r s t r a i g h t line be inflected, KexXdoBa Sri rd\iv (without eideta). The
verb K\&U (to break off) was the regular technical term for drawing from a point a (broken)
straight line which first meets another straight line or curve and is then bent back from it
to another point, or (in other words) for drawing straight lines from two points meeting at a
point on a curve or another straight line. Kcic\&<r6at is one of the geometrical terms the
definition of which must according to Aristotle be assumed {Anal. Post. I, 10, 76 b 9).
T h e early editors, Tartaglia, C o m m a n d i n u s , P e l e t a r i u s , Clavius a n d o t h e r s ,
gave t h e extension of this proposition t o t h e c a s e w h e r e t h e s e g m e n t is less

The
c o n v e n i e n c e of t h e extension is o b v i o u s , a n d t h e proof of it is t h e s a m e a s t h e
first p a r t of E u c l i d ' s proof. B y m e a n s of t h e e x t e n s i o n i n . 2 1 is d e m o n s t r a t e d

B u t all t h e e d i t o r s referred t o were forestalled in this m a t t e r by H e r o n , a s

H e r o n gives t h e e x t e n s i o n of E u c l i d ' s proposition which, h e says, it h a d b e e n

latter case. H e r o n ' s e n u n c i a t i o n is i m p o r t a n t as showing h o w h e d e s c r i b e s
what we should n o w call a n " a n g l e " greater t h a n t w o right angles. ( T h e
language of G h e r a r d ' s translation is, in o t h e r respects, a little o b s c u r e ; b u t
t h e m e a n i n g is m a d e clear by w h a t follows.)
" T h e a n g l e , " H e r o n says, " which is at t h e c e n t r e of a n y circle is d o u b l e
of t h e angle which is a t t h e c i r c u m f e r e n c e of it when one arc is the base of both
angles; a n d the remaining angles which are at the centre, and fill up the four

T h u s t h e " a n g l e greater t h a n t w o right a n g l e s " is for H e r o n t h e s u m of
certain " angles " in t h e E u c l i d e a n sense of angles less t h a n t w o right a n g l e s .
