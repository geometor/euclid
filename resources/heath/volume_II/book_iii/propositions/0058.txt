the three angles CAB, ABC,
are equal to two right angles.

BCA

of the triangle

ABC

But the angle CAB is equal to the
angle BDC, for they are in the same
segment BADC;
[rati]
and the angle A CB is equal to the angle
ADB, for they are in the same segment

ADCB;
therefore the whole angle ADC is equal
to the angles BAC,
ACB.
Let the angle ABC be added to each ;
therefore the angles ABC, BAC, ACB
are equal to the
angles ABC,
ADC.
But the angles ABC,
angles;

BAC,

ACB

are equal to two right

therefore the angles ABC, ADC are also equal to two right
angles.
Similarly we can prove that the angles BAD, DCB are
also equal to two right angles.
Therefore etc.

PROPOSITION

23.

On the same straight line there cannot be constructed two
similar and unequal segments of circles on the same side.
For, if possible, on the same straight line AB let two
similar and unequal segments of circles
ACB, ADB be constructed on the same
side;
^^r°
let A CD be drawn through, and let CB,
DB be joined.

Then, since the segment ACB
similar to the segment
ADB,
