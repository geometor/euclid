the point B will also coincide with the point D, because
is equal to CD ;
and, AB

coinciding with CD,

the segment AEB

will also coincide with

CED.

Q

F

For, if the straight line AB coincide with CD but the
segment AEB
do not coincide with CFD,
it will either fall within it, or outside it;
15 or it will fall awry, as CGD, and a circle cuts a circle at more
points than two : which is impossible.
[in. 10]
Therefore, if the straight line AB be applied to CD, the
segment AEB will not fail to coincide with CFD also ;
therefore it will coincide with it and will be equal to it.

PROPOSITION

25.

Given a segment of a circle, to describe the complete circle
of which it is a segment.
Let ABC

be the given segment of a circle ;

thus it is required to describe the complete circle belonging
to the segment ABC, that is, of which it is a segment.
For let AC be bisected at D, let DB be drawn from the
point D at right angles to AC, and let AB. be joined ;
