the angle ABD
is then greater than, equal to, or less
than the angle
BAD.
First let it be greater ;
and on the straight line BA, and at the point A
the angle BAE
be constructed equal to
the angle ABD;
let DB be drawn through
to E, and let EC be joined.
Then, since the angle ABE
the angle BA E,
the straight line EB

on it, let

is equal to

is also equal to

EA.

[1.6]

And, since AD is equal to DC,
and DE is common,
the two sides AD, DE
respectively ;
and the angle ADE
right;

are equal to the two sides CD,

is equal to the angle CDE,

therefore the base AE
But AE

is equal to the base

was proved equal to

therefore BE

DE

for each is
CE.

BE;

is also equal to

CE;

therefore the three straight lines AE,
one another.

EB,

EC are equal to

Therefore the circle drawn with centre E and distance
one of the straight lines AE, EB, EC will also pass through
the remaining points and will have been completed.
[m. 9 ]
Therefore, given a segment of a circle, the complete circle
has been described.
And it is manifest that the segment ABC is less than a
semicircle, because the centre E happens to be outside it.
Similarly, even if. the angle ABD

be equal to the angle

BAD,
AD

being equal to each of the two BD,

the three straight lines DA,
be equal to one another,

DB,

DC,

DC will

D will be the centre of the completed circle,
and ABC

will clearly be a semicircle.
