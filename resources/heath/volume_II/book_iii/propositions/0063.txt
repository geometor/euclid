Let ABC, DEF be equal circles, and in them let there
be equal angles, namely at the centres the angles
BGC,
EHF, and at the circumferences the angles BAC,
EDF;
I say that the circumference BKC is equal to the circum­
ference
ELF.

Now, since the circles ABC, DEF are equal,
the radii are equal.
Thus the two straight lines BG, GC are equal to the
two straight lines EH,
HF;
and the angle at G is equal to the angle at H;
therefore the base BC is equal to the base EF.
[1. 4 ]
And, since the angle at A is equal to the angle at D,
the segment BAC
is similar to the segment
EDF;
[IIL Def. 1 1 ]
and they are upon equal straight lines.
But similar segments of circles on equal straight lines are
equal to one another;
[in. 2 4 ]
therefore the segment BA C is equal to EDF.
But the whole circle ABC is also equal to the whole circle

DEF;
therefore the circumference BKC
the circumference
ELF.
Therefore etc.

which remains is equal to
