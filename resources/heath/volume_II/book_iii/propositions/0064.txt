PROPOSITION

27.

In equal circles angles standing on equal circumferences
are equal to one another, whether they stand at the centres or
at the circumferences.
For in equal circles ABC, DEF, on equal circumferences
BC, EF, let the angles BGC, EHF
stand at the centres G,
H, and the angles BAC, EDF at the circumferences ;
I say that the angle BGC
and the angle BAC

is equal to the angle

is equal to the angle

EHF,

EDF.

For, if the angle BGC is unequal to the angle EHF,
one of them is greater.
Let the angle BGC be greater : and on the straight line BG,
and at the point G on it, let the angle BGK be constructed
equal to the angle EHF.
[1. 2 3 ]
Now equal angles stand on equal circumferences, when
they are at the centres ;
[in. 2 6 ]
therefore the circumference BK
ference EF.
But EF

is equal to

is equal to the circum­

BC;

therefore BK is also equal to BC,
greater : which is impossible.
Therefore the angle BGC

EHF;
therefore it is equal to it.

the less to the

is not unequal to the angle
