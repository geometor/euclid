And the angle at A is half of the angle

BGC,

and the angle at D half of the angle EHF;

[in. 2 0 ]

therefore the angle at A is also equal to the angle at D.
Therefore etc.

PROPOSITION

28.

In equal circles equal straight lines cut off equal circum­
ferences, the greater equal to the greater and the less to the
less.
Let ABC, DEF be equal circles, and in the circles let
AB, DE be equal straight lines cutting off ACB, DFE as
greater circumferences and A GB, DHE as lesser ;
I say that the greater circumference ACB is equal to the
greater circumference DFE, and the less circumference AGB
to DHE.

For let the centres K, L of the circles be taken, and let
KB, DL, LE be joined.
Now, since the circles are equal,
the radii are also equal;
therefore the two sides AK, KB are equal to the two
sides DL,
LE;
AK,

and the base AB is equal to the base DE;
therefore the angle A KB is equal to the angle

DLE.
[1.8]

But equal angles stand on equal circumferences, when
they are at the centres ;
[m. 2 6 ]
therefore the circumference AGB is equal to DHE.
