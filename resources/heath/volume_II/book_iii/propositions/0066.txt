And the whole circle ABC
is also equal to the whole
circle
DEF;
therefore the circumference A CB which remains is also equal
to the circumference DEE which remains.
Therefore etc.

In equal circles equal circumferences are subtended by equal
straight lines.
Let ABC, DEF be equal circles, and in them let equal
circumferences BGC, EHF
be cut off; and let the straight
lines BC, EF be joined ;
I say that BC is equal to EF.

For let the centres of the circles be taken, and let them
be K, L ; let BK, KC, EL, LE be joined.
Now, since the circumference BGC is equal to the
circumference
EHF,
the angle BKC is also equal to the angle-ELF. [HI. 2 7 ]
And, since the circles ABC, DEF are equal,
the radii are also equal;
therefore the two sides BK, KC are equal to the two sides
EL, LE; and they contain equal angles ;
therefore the base BC is equal to the base EF.
[1. 4 ]
Therefore etc.
