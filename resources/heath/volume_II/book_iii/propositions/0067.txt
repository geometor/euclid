To bisect a given circumference.
Let ADB

be the given circumference ;

thus it is required to bisect the circumference

ADB.

Let AB be joined and bisected at
C; from the point C let CD be drawn
at right angles to the straight line AB,
and let AD, DB be joined.
Then, since A C is equal to CB,
and CD is common,
the two sides A C, CD are equal to the two sides BC,
and the angle A CD is equal to the angle BCD,
right;
therefore the base AD

CD;

for each is

is equal to the base DB.

[1. 4]

But equal straight lines cut off equal circumferences, the
greater equal to the greater, and the less to the less ; [in. 2 8 ]
and each of the circumferences AD,
semicircle ;
therefore the circumference AD
ference DB.

DB is less than a

is equal to the circum­

Therefore the given circumference has been bisected at
the point D.
Q. E . F.

PROPOSITION

31.

In a circle the angle in the semicircle is right, that in a
greater segment less than a right angle, and that in a less
segment greater than a right angle; and further the angle of
the greater segment is greater than a right angle, and the angle
of the less segment less than a right angle.
