Let ABCD be a circle, let BC be its diameter, and £
centre, and let BA, AC, AD,
DC
be joined;

its

I say that the angle BAC
in the
semicircle BAC is right,
the angle ABC in the segment ABC
greater than the semicircle is less
than a right angle,
and the angle ADC in the segment
ADC
less than the semicircle is
greater than a right angle.
Let AE be joined, and let BA
be carried through to F.
Then, since BE is equal to EA,
the angle ABE is also equal to the angle BAE.
Again, since CE is equal to EA,

[1. 5 ]

the angle ACE is also equal to the angle CAE.
[1. 5 ]
Therefore the whole angle BAC is equal to the two angles

ABC, ACB.
But the angle FAC exterior to the triangle ABC is also
equal to the two angles ABC, ACB;
[1. 3 2 ]
therefore the angle BAC is also equal to the angle FAC;
therefore each is right;
[1. Def. 1 0 ]
therefore the angle BA C in the semicircle BA C is right.
Next, since in the triangle ABC the two angles ABC,
BAC are less than two right angles,
[i- 1 7 ]
and the angle BA C is a right angle,
the angle ABC is less than a right angle ;
and it is the angle in the segment ABC greater than the
semicircle.
Next, since ABCD is a quadrilateral in a circle,
and the opposite angles of quadrilaterals in circles are equal
to two right angles,
[in. 2 2 ]
while the angle ABC is less than a right angle,
therefore the angle ADC which remains is greater than a
right angle;
and it is the angle in the segment ADC
circle.
