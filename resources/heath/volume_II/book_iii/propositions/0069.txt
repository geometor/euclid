I say further that the angle of the greater segment, namely
that contained by the circumference ABC and the straight
line AC, is greater than a right angle ;
and the angle of the less segment, namely that contained by
the circumference ADC and the straight line AC, is less than
a right angle.
1 his is at once manifest.
For, since the angle contained by the straight lines BA,
is right,
the angle contained by the circumference ABC
straight line A C is greater than a right angle.

AC

and the

Again, since the angle contained by the straight lines
right,

AC, AFis

the angle contained by the straight line CA and the
circumference ADC is less than a right angle.
Therefore etc.

A s already stated, this proposition is i m m e d i a t e l y d e d u c i b l e from 111. 20 if
t h a t t h e o r e m is e x t e n d e d so a s t o i n c l u d e t h e case w h e r e t h e s e g m e n t is e q u a l
to o r less t h a n a semicircle, a n d w h e r e c o n s e q u e n t l y t h e '•' a n g l e at t h e c e n t r e "
is e q u a l t o t w o right angles o r greater t h a n t w o right angles respectively.
T h e r e a r e i n d i c a t i o n s in Aristotle t h a t t h e proof of t h e first p a r t of t h e

Two
passages of Aristotle refer t o t h e proposition t h a t t h e a n g l e in a semicircle
is a right angle. T h e first passage is Anal. Post. 11. n , 94 a 2 8 : " W h y is
t h e angle in a semicircle a right a n g l e ? O r what m a k e s it a right a n g l e ?
(TIVOS 6VTOS opdr);)
S u p p o s e A t o b e a right angle, B half of t w o right
angles, C t h e angle in a semicircle. T h e n B is t h e c a u s e of A, t h e right
angle, being a n a t t r i b u t e of C, t h e a n g l e in t h e semicircle.
F o r B is e q u a l t o
A, a n d CtoB;
for C is half of t w o right angles. T h e r e f o r e it is in virtue of
B being half of two right angles t h a t A is a n a t t r i b u t e of C; a n d t h e latter
m e a n s t h e fact t h a t t h e a n g l e in a semicircle is right." N o w t h i s p a s s a g e
by itself would b e consistent with a proof like E u c l i d ' s o r t h e a l t e r n a t i v e

B u t t h e s e c o n d passage t h r o w s a

straight lines, two forming the base, and the third set up at right angles at its
