circle, that is, that the angle FBD
is equal to the angle
constructed in the segment BAD,
and the angle EBD
is
equal to the angle constructed in the
segment DCB.
For let BA be drawn from B at
right angles to EF,
let a point C be taken at random on
the circumference
BD,
and let AD, DC, CB be joined.
Then, since a straight line
EF
touches the circle ABCD at B,
and BA has been drawn from the point
of contact at right angles to the tangent,
the centre of the circle ABCD is on BA.
[in. 1 9 ]
Therefore BA is a diameter of the circle ABCD ;
therefore the angle ADB, being an angle in a semicircle,
is right.
[HI. 3 1 ]
Therefore the remaining angles BAD, ABD are equal to
one right angle.
[i. 3 2 ]
But the angle ABE is also right ;
therefore the angle ABE is equal to the angles BAD,
ABD.
Let the angle A BD be subtracted from each;
therefore the angle DBF which remains is equal to the angle
BAD in the alternate segment of the circle.
Next, since ABCD is a quadrilateral in a circle,
its opposite angles are equal to two right angles.

[in. 22]

But the angles DBF, DBE are also equal to two right
angles;
therefore the angles DBF, DBE
are equal to the angles

BAD, BCD,
of which the angle BAD

was proved equal to the angle

DBF;
therefore the angle DBE which remains is equal to the
angle DCB in the alternate segment DCB of the circle.
Therefore etc.

Q. E. D.

T h e c o n v e r s e of t h i s t h e o r e m is t r u e , n a m e l y t h a t , If a straight
lint
drawn through one extremity of a chord of a circle make with that chord
angles equal respectively to the angles in the alternate segments of the circle,
the straight line so drawn touches the circle.
