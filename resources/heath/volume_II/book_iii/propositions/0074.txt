bisected at F, let FG be drawn from the point F at right
angles to AB, and let GB be joined.
Then, since AFis equal to FB,
and FG is common,
the two sides A F, FG are equal to the two sides BF,
and the angle AFG is equal to the angle BFG;

FG;

therefore the base AG is equal to the base BG,
[i. 4]
Therefore the circle described with centre G and distance
GA will pass through B also.
Let it be drawn, and let it be ABE ;
let EB be joined.
Now, since AD is drawn from A, the extremity of the
diameter AE, at right angles to AE,
therefore AD touches the circle ABE.
[HI. 16, Por.]
Since then a straight line AD touches the circle
ABE,
and from the point of contact at A a. straight line AB is
drawn across in the circle
ABE,
the angle DAB is equal to the angle AEB
segment of the circle.
But the angle DAB

in the alternate
[HI. 3 2 ]

is equal to the angle at C;

therefore the angle at C i s also equal to the angle
AEB.
Therefore on the given straight line AB the segment
AEB of a circle has been described admitting the angle A EB
equal to the given angle, the angle at C.
N e x t let the angle at C be right;

and let it be again required to describe on AB a segment
of a circle admitting an angle equal to the right angle at C.
Let the angle BAD
be constructed equal to the right
angle at C, as is the case in the second figure ;
