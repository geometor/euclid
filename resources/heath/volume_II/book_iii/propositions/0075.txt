let AB be bisected at F, and with centre F and distance
either FA or FB let the circle AEB be described.
Therefore the straight line AD touches the circle
ABE,
because the angle at A is right.
[in. 16, P o r . ]
And the angle BAD is equal to the angle in the segment
AEB,
for the latter too is itself a right angle, being an
angle in a semicircle.
[in. 3 1 ]
But the angle BAD is also equal to the angle at C.
Therefore the angle AEB is also equal to the angle at C.
Therefore again the segment AEB
of a circle has been
described on AB admitting an angle equal to the angle at C.
Next, let the angle at C be obtuse;
A

o

and on the straight line AB, and at the point A, let the
angle BAD be constructed equal to it, as is the case in the
third figure;
let AE be drawn at right angles to AD, let AB be again
bisected at F, let FG be drawn at right angles to AB, and
let GB be joined.
Then, since AFis again equal to FB,
and FG is common,
the two sides AF, FG are equal to the two sides BF,
FG;
and the angle AFG is equal to the angle BEG;
therefore the base AG is equal to the base BG.
[1. 4]
Therefore the circle described with centre G and distance
GA will pass through B also ; let it so pass, as
AEB.
Now, since AD is drawn at right angles to the diameter
AE from its extremity,
AD touches the circle AEB.
[in. 16, P o r . ]
And AB has been drawn across from the point of contact
at A ;
therefore the angle BAD is equal to the angle constructed
in the alternate segment AHB of the circle.
