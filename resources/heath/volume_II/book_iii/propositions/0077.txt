and BC has been drawn across from the point of contact
at B,
the angle FBC is equal to the angle constructed in the alternate
segment BAC.
[in. 3 2 ]

But the angle FBC

is equal to the angle at D ;

therefore the angle in the segment BAC
angle at D.

is equal to the

Therefore from the given circle ABC the segment
BAC
has been cut off admitting an angle equal to the given recti­
lineal angle, the angle at D.

If in a circle two straight lines cut one another, the
rectangle contained by the segments of the one is equal to the
rectangle contained by the segments of the other.
For in the circle ABCD let the two straight lines AC,
BD cut one another at the point

E;

I say that the rectangle contained by AE,
EC is equal to the rectangle contained by

DE, EB.
If now A C, BD are through the centre,
so that E is the centre of the circle ABCD,
it is manifest that, AE,
being equal,

EC,

DE,

the rectangle contained by AE,
rectangle contained by DE,
EB.

EC

EB
is also equal to the
