N e x t let AC, DB not be through the centre;
let the centre of ABCD be taken, and
let it be F;
from F let FG, FH be drawn perpen­
dicular to the straight lines AC,
DB,
and let FB, FC, FE be joined.
Then, since a straight line
GF
through the centre cuts a straight line
AC not through the centre at right
angles,
c
it also bisects it;
[m. 3]
therefore AG is equal to GC.
Since, then, the straight line A C has been cut into equal
parts at G and into unequal parts at E,
the rectangle contained by AE, EC together with the square
on EG is equal to the square on GC;
(u. 5]
Let the square on GF be added ;
therefore the rectangle AE, EC together with the squares
on GE, GF is equal to the squares on CG, GF.
But the square on FE is equal to the squares on EG, GF,
and the square on FC is equal to the squares on CG, GF;
['• 471
therefore the rectangle AE, EC together with the square
on FE is equal to the square on FC
And FC is equal to FB ;
therefore the rectangle AE, EC together with the square on
EF is equal to the square on FB.
For the same reason, also,
the rectangle DE, EB together with the square on FE is
equal to the square on FB.
But the rectangle AE, EC together with the square on
FE was also proved equal to the square on FB ;
therefore the rectangle AE, EC together with the square on
FE is equal to the rectangle DE, EB together with the
square on FE.
Let the square on FE be subtracted from each ;
therefore the rectangle contained by AE, EC which remains
is equal to the rectangle contained by DE,
EB.
Therefore etc.
