line intercepted on it outside between the point and the convex
circumference will be equal to the square on the tangent.
For let a point D be taken outside the circle
and from D let the two straight lines DC A,
DB fall on the circle ABC;
let DC A cut
the circle ABC and let BD touch it;
I say that the rectangle contained by AD,
DC is equal to the square on DB.

ABC,

Then DCA is either through the centre
or not through the centre.
First let it be through the centre, and
let F be the centre of the circle
ABC;
let FB be joined ;
therefore the angle FBD is right.
[m. 18]
And, since A C has been bisected at F, and CD is added
to it,
the rectangle AD, DC together with the square on FC is
equal to the square on FD.
[11. 6 ]
But FC is equal to FB ;
therefore the rectangle AD, DC together with the square on
FB is equal to the square on FD.
And the squares on FB, BD are equal to the square on

FD;

[1. 47]

therefore the rectangle AD, DC together with the square on
FB is equal to the squares on FB, BD.
Let the square on FB be subtracted from each ;
therefore the rectangle AD, DC which remains is equal to
the square on the tangent DB.
Again, let DCA not be through the centre of the circle

ABC;
let the centre E be taken, and from E
let EF be drawn perpendicular to AC;
let EB, EC, ED be joined.
Then the angle EBD is right.
[HI. 1 8 ]

And, since a straight line
EF
through the centre cuts a straight line
AC not through the centre at right angles,
it also bisects it;
therefore AF is equal to FC.
