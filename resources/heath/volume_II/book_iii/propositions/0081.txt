Now, since the straight line AC has been bisected at the
point F, and CD is added to it,
the rectangle contained by AD, DC together with the square
on FC is equal to the square on FD.
[it. 6 ]
Let the square on FE be added to each ;
therefore the rectangle AD, DC together with the squares
on CF, FE is equal to the squares on FD,
FE.
But the square on EC is equal to the squares on CF, FE,
for the angle EEC is right;
[1, 4 7 ]
and the square on ED is equal to the squares on DF,
FE;
therefore the rectangle AD, DC together with the square on
EC is equal to the square on ED.
And EC is equal to EB ;
therefore the rectangle AD, DC together with the square on
EB is equal to the square on ED.
But the squares on EB, BD are equal to the square on
ED, for the angle EBD is right;
[1. 47]
therefore the rectangle AD, DC together with the square on
EB is equal to the squares on EB,
BD.
Let the square on EB be subtracted from each ;
therefore the rectangle AD, DC which remains is equal to
the square on DB.
Therefore etc.

there fall on the circle two straight lines, if one of them cut
the circle, and the other fall on it, and if further the rect­
