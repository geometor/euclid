the circle and the straight line intercepted on it outside
between the point and the convex circumference be equal to
the square on the straight line which falls on the circle, the
straight line which falls on it will touch the circle.
For let a point D be taken outside the circle
from D let the two straight lines
DCA, DB fall on the circle
ACB;
let DCA
cut the circle and
DB
fall on it; and let the rectangle AD,
DC be equal to the square on DB.

ABC;

I say that DB touches the circle

ABC.
For let DE be drawn touching
ABC;
let the centre of the circle ABC be taken, and let it
be F; let FE, FB, FD be joined.
Thus the angle FED is right.
[m. 1 8 ]
Now, since DE touches the circle ABC, and DCA cuts it,
the rectangle AD, DC is equal to the square on DE.
[lit 3 6 ]
But the rectangle AD, DC was also equal to the square
on DB;
therefore the square on DE is equal to the square on DB;
therefore DE is equal to DB.
And FE is equal to FB ;
therefore the two sides DE, EF are equal to the two sides

DB, BF;
and FD is the common base of the triangles;
therefore the angle DEF

is equal to the angle

DBF.
[l. 8]

But the angle DEF is right;
therefore the angle DBF is also right.
And FB produced is a diameter ;
and the straight line drawn at right angles to the diameter
of a circle, from its extremity, touches the circle ; [m. 1 6 , Por.]
therefore DB touches the circle.
Similarly this can be proved to be the case even if the
centre be on A C.
Therefore etc.
