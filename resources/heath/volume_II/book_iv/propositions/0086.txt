PROPOSITION

I.

Into a given circle to fit a straight line equal to a given
straight line which is not greater than the diameter of the
circle.
Let ABC be the given circle, and D the given straight
line not greater than the diameter
of the circle;
thus it is required to fit into the
circle ABC a straight line equal
to the straight line D.
Let a diameter BC of the
circle ABC
be drawn.
Then, if BC is equal to D,
that which was enjoined will have
been done ; for BC has been fitted into the circle ABC
to the straight line D.

equal

But, if BC is greater than D,
let CE be made equal to D, and with centre C and distance
CE let the circle EAF be described ;
let CA be joined.
Then, since the point C is the centre of the circle

EAF,

CA is equal to CE.
But CE is equal to D ;
therefore D is also equal to

CA.

Therefore into the given circle ABC
CA equal to the given straight line D.
