on the straight line AH, and at the point A on it, let the
angle HAC be constructed enual to the angle DEF,
and on the straight line A G, and at the point A on it, let
the angle GAB be constructed equal to the angle DFE;
[i. 2 3 ]

let BC be joined.

Then, since a straight line AH touches the circle
and from the point of contact at A the straight line
drawn across in the circle,
therefore the angle HAC is equal to the angle ABC
alternate segment of the circle.

ABC,
AC is
in the
[m. 3 2 ]

But the angle HA C is equal to the angle DEF;
therefore the angle ABC is also equal to the angle DEF.
For the same reason
the angle ACB is also equal to the angle
DFE;
therefore the remaining angle BAC
is also equal to the
remaining angle EDF.
[1. 3 2 ]
Therefore in the given circle there has been inscribed a
triangle equiangular with the given triangle.
