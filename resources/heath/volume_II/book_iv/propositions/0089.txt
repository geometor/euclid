PROPOSITION

3.

About a given circle to circumscribe a triangle equiangular
with a given triangle.
Let ABC
be the given circle, and DEF
the given
triangle ;
; thus it is required to circumscribe about the circle ABC a
triangle equiangular with the triangle DEF.

Let EF

be produced in both directions to the points

G, H,
let the centre K of the circle ABC be taken [ i n . 1 ] , and let
10 the straight line KB be drawn across at random;
on the straight line KB, and at the point K on it, let the
angle BKA be constructed equal to the angle DEG,
and the angle BKC equal to the angle DFH;
[1. 2 3 ]
and through the points A, B, C let LAM, MBN, NCL be
15 drawn touching the circle ABC.
[in. 1 6 , Por.]
Now, since LM, MN, NL touch the circle ABC at the
points A, B, C,
and KA, KB, KC have been joined from the centre K to
the points A, B, C,
