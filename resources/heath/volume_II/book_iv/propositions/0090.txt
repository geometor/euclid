20 therefore the angles at the points A, B, C are right.

[m. 1 8 ]

And, since the four angles of the quadrilateral AMBK
are equal to four right angles, inasmuch as AMBK is in fact
divisible into two triangles,
and the angles KAM,
KBM are right,
25 therefore the remaining angles A KB, A MB are equal to two
right angles.
But the angles DEG, DEF are also equal to two right
angles;
[i. 1 3 ]
therefore the angles A KB, A MB are equal to the angles
30

DEG, DEF,
of which the angle A KB

is equal to the angle

therefore the angle A MB
angle DEF which remains.

DEG;

which remains is equal to the

Similarly it can be proved that the angle LNB
is also
35 equal to the angle
DFE;
therefore the remaining angle MLN
is equal to the
angle EDF.
[1. 3 2 ]
Therefore the triangle LMN
is equiangular with the
triangle DEF;
and it has been circumscribed about the
40 circle
ABC.
Therefore about a given circle there has been circum­
scribed a triangle equiangular with the given triangle.
