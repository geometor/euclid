PROPOSITION

4.

In a given triangle to inscribe a circle.
Let ABC be the given triangle ;
thus it is required to inscribe a circle in the triangle
Let the angles ABC,
ACB
5 be bisected by the straight lines

ABC.
*

BD, CD [1. 9], and let these meet
y / \
one another at the point D ;

\d
from D let DE,
DF, DG be
/ !
\D^A
drawn perpendicular to the straight

" \/ \
10 lines AB, BC, CA.

Now, since the angle ABD
Q
F
C
is equal to the angle CBD,
and the right angle BED is also equal to the right angle

N

BED,
15 EBD, FBD are two triangles having two angles equal to two
angles and one side equal to one side, namely that subtending
one of the equal angles, which is BD common to the
triangles;
therefore they will also have the remaining sides equal to
20 the remaining sides ;
[1. 2 6 ]
therefore DE is equal to DF.
For the same reason
DG is also equal to DF.
Therefore the three straight lines DE, DF, DG are equal
25 to one another ;
therefore the circle described with centre D and distance
one of the straight lines DE, DF, DG will pass also
through the remaining points, and will touch the straight
lines AB, BC, CA, because the angles at the points E, F, G
30 are right.
For, if it cuts them, the straight line drawn at right angles
to the diameter of the circle from its extremity will be found
to fall within the circle : which was proved absurd ;
