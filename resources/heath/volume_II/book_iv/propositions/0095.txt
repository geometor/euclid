First let them meet within at F, and let FB,
joined.
Then, since AD

is equal to

FC, FA

be

DB,

and DF is common and at right angles,
therefore the base AF

is equal to the base FB-

['• 4]

Similarly we can prove that
CF is also equal to

AF;

so that FB is also equal to FC;
therefore the three straight lines FA,
to one another.

FB, FC are equal

Therefore the circle described with centre F and distance
one of the straight lines FA, FB, FC will pass also through
the remaining points, and the circle will have been circum­
scribed about the triangle ABC.
Let it be circumscribed, as ABC.
Next, let DF, EF meet on the straight line BC at F,
as is the case in the second figure ; and let AFbe joined.
Then, similarly, we shall prove that the point F is the
centre of the circle circumscribed about the triangle ABC.
Again, let DF, EF meet outside the triangle ABC at F,
as is the case in the third figure, and let AF, BF, CF be
joined.
Then again, since AD

is equal to

DB,

and DF is common and at right angles,
therefore the base AF

is equal to the base BF.

Similarly we can prove that
CF is also equal to AF;
so that BF is also equal to FC;
therefore the circle described with centre F and distance one
of the straight lines FA, FB, FC will pass also through
the remaining points, and will have been circumscribed about
the triangle ABC.
Therefore about the given triangle a circle has been
circumscribed.
Q. E. F.

And it is manifest that, when the centre of the circle falls
within the triangle, the angle BAC, being in a segment
greater than the semicircle, is less than a right angle;
