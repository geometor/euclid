In a given circle to inscribe a square.
Let ABCD
be the given circle ;
thus it is required to inscribe a square in the circle
ABCD.
Let two diameters AC, BD of the
circle ABCD
be drawn at right angles
to one another, and let AB, BC, CD,
DA be joined.
Then, since BE is equal to ED, for
E is the centre,
and EA is common and at right angles,
therefore the base AB is equal to the
base AD.
[1.4]
For the same reason
each of the straight lines BC, CD is also equal to each of
the straight lines AB, AD ;
therefore the quadrilateral ABCD
is equilateral.
I say next that it is also right-angled.
For, since the straight line BD is a diameter of the circle
ABCD,
therefore BAD is a semicircle ;
therefore the angle BAD i s right.
[m. 3 1 ]
For the same reason
each of the angles A BC, BCD, CD A is also right;
c

therefore the quadrilateral ABCD
is right-angled.
But it was also proved equilateral;
therefore it is a square;
[1. Def. 2 2 ]
and it has been inscribed in the circle
ABCD.
Therefore in the given circle the square ABCD
has been
inscribed.
