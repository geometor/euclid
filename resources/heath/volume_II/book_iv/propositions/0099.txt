For the same reason
A C is also parallel to FK,
so that GH is also parallel to FK.
[i. 30J
Similarly we can prove that
each of the straight lines GF, HK is parallel to BED.
Therefore GK, GC, AK, FB, BK are parallelograms ;
therefore GF is equal to HK, and GH to FK.
[1. 34]
And, since AC is equal to BD,
and AC is also equal to each of the straight lines GH,
while BD

is equal to each of the straight lines GF,

FK,
HK,
['• 34]

therefore the quadrilateral FGHK is equilateral.
I say next that it is also right-angled.
For, since GBEA is a parallelogram,
and the angle AEB
is right,
therefore the angle A GB is also right.
[1. 34]
Similarly we can prove that
the angles at H, K, F are also right.
Therefore FGHK is right-angled.
But it was also proved equilateral;
therefore it is a square ;
and it has been circumscribed about the circle ABCD.
Therefore about the given circle a square has been
circumscribed.
