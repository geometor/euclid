About a given square to circumscribe a circle.
Let ABCD be the given square;
thus it is required to circumscribe a circle about the square

ABCD.
For let AC, BD be joined, and let them
cut one another at E.
Then, since DA is equal to AB,
and AC is common,
therefore the two sides DA, AC are equal
to the two sides BA,
AC;
and the base DC is equal to the base BC;
therefore the angle DA C is equal to
the angle BAC.
[i. 8 ]
Therefore the angle DAB is bisected by AC.
Similarly we can prove that each of the angles
ABC,
BCD, CD A is bisected by the straight lines AC,
DB.
Now, since the angle DAB is equal to the angle ABC,
and the angle EAB is half the angle
DAB,
and the angle EBA half the angle ABC,
therefore the angle EAB is also equal to the angle EBA ;
so that the side EA is also equal to EB.
[i. 6 ]
Similarly we can prove that each of the straight lines
EA, EB is equal to each of the straight lines EC,
ED.
Therefore the four straight lines EA, EB, EC, ED are
equal to one another.
Therefore the circle described with centre E and distance
one of the straight lines EA, EB, EC, ED will pass also
through the remaining points ;
and it will have been circumscribed about the square

ABCD.

Let it be circumscribed, as ABCD.
Therefore about the given square a circle has
circumscribed.
