PROPOSITION

IO.

To construct an isosceles triangle having each of the angles
at the base double of the remaining one.
Let any straight line AB be set out, and let it be cut at
the point C so that the rectangle
contained by AB, BC is equal to
the square on CA;
[n. n ]
with centre A and distance AB
the circle BDE be described,

let

and let there be fitted in the circle
BDE the straight line BD equal to
the straight line AC which is not
greater than the diameter of the
circle BDE.
[iv. i ]
Let AD, DC be joined, and let
the circle ACD be circumscribed about the triangle

ACD.
[iv. 5]

Then, since the rectangle AB,
on AC,
and AC is equal to

BC is equal to the square

BD,

therefore the rectangle AB,

BC is equal to the square on

BD.

And, since a point B has been taken outside the circle

ACD,
and from B the two straight lines BA, BD have fallen on
the circle A CD, and one of them cuts it, while the other falls
on it,
and the rectangle AB,

BC is equal to the square on

BD,

therefore BD touches the circle A CD.

[ i n . 37]

Since, then, BD touches it, and DC
from the point of contact at D,

is drawn across

therefore the angle BDC is equal to the angle DA C in the
alternate segment of the circle.
[in. 32]
Since, then, the angle BDC is equal to the angle
let the angle CD A be added to each ;
therefore the whole angle BDA

CDA, DAC.

DAC,

is equal to the two angles
