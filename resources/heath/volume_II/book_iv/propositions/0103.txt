therefore the angle BDA

is also equal to the angle

BCD.

But the angle BDA is equal to the angle CBD, since the
side AD is also equal to AB ;
[I. 5]
so that the angle DBA is also equal to the angle BCD.
Therefore the three angles BDA, DBA, BCD are equal
to one another.
And, since the angle DBC is equal to the angle BCD,
the side BD is also equal to the side DC.
[1. 6 ]
But BD is by hypothesis equal to CA ;
therefore CA is also equal to CD,
so that the angle CD A is also equal to the angle DAC;
[«• 5]

therefore the angles CD A, DA C are double of the angle DA C.
But the angle BCD

is equal to the angles CD A,

DAC;

therefore the angle BCD is also double of the angle CAD.
But the angle BCD is equal to each of the angles BDA,

DBA ;
therefore each of the angles BDA,
the angle DAB.

DBA

is also double of

Therefore the isosceles triangle ABD has been constructed
having each of the angles at the base DB double of the
remaining one.
