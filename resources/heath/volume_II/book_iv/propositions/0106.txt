PROPOSITION

11.

In a given circle to inscribe an equilateral and equiangular
pentagon.
Let ABCDE be the given circle ;
thus it is required to inscribe in the circle ABCDE an equi­
lateral and equiangular pentagon.
Let the isosceles triangle FGH
be set out having each of the angles
at G, H double of the angle at F;
[iv. 1 0 ]

let there be inscribed in the circle
ABCDE the triangle A CD equi­
angular with the triangle FGH, so
that the angle CAD is equal to the angle at F and the angles
at G, H respectively equal to the angles A CD, CD A ; [iv. 2 ]
therefore each of the angles A CD, CD A is also double of the
angle CAD.
Now let the angles ACD, CD A be bisected respectively
by the straight lines CE, DB [1. 9], and let AB, BC, DE,
EA
be joined.
Then, since each of the angles A CD, CD A is double of
the angle CAD,
and they have been bisected by the straight lines CE,

DB,
