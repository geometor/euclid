But equal angles stand on equal circumferences;
therefore the five circumferences AB,
equal to one another.

But equal circumferences are subtended by equal straight
lines;
[ill. 29]
therefore the five straight lines AB,
equal to one another ;

BC, CD, DE,

therefore the pentagon ABCDE

is equilateral.

I say next that it is also equiangular.
For, since the circumference AB is equal to the circum­
ference DE, let BCD be added to each ;
therefore the whole circumference A BCD

whole circumference
And the angle AED

is equal to the

ABCD,

on the circumference EDCB ;

therefore the angle BAE

is also equal to the angle

AED.
[in. 27]

For the same reason
each of the angles ABC, BCD,
of the angles BAE, AED ;

CDE

therefore the pentagon ABCDE

is also equal to each

is equiangular.

But it was also proved equilateral;
therefore in the given circle an equilateral and equi­
angular pentagon has been inscribed.
Q. E. F.

De Morgan remarks that "the method of iv. 11 is not so natural as
making a direct use of the angle obtained in the last." On the other hand,
if we look at the figure and notice that it shows the whole of the pentagramstar except one line (that connecting B and E), I think we shall conclude
that the method is nearer to that used by the Pythagoreans, and therefore of
much more historical interest.
Another method would of course be to use iv. 10 to describe a decagon in
the circle, and then to join any vertex to the next alternate one, the latter to
the next alternate one, and so on.
