Mr H. M. Taylor gives " a complete geometrical construction for in­
scribing a regular decagon or pentagon in a given circle," as follows.
" Find O the centre.
Draw two diameters AOC, BOD at right
angles to one another.
Bisect OD in E.
Draw AE and cut off EF equal to OE.
Place round the circle ten chords equal
to AF.
These chords will be the sides of a regular
decagon. Draw the chords joining five alternate
vertices of the decagon; they will be the sides
of a regular pentagon."
The construction is of course only a com­
bination of those in n. 11 and iv. i ; and the
proof would have to follow that in iv. 10.

PROPOSITION 

12.


About a given circle to circumscribe an equilateral and
equiangular pentagon.
Let ABCDE be the given circle ;
thus it is required to circumscribe an equilateral and equi­
angular pentagon about the circle

ABCDE.
Let A, B, C, D, E be conceived to
be the angular points of the inscribed
pentagon, so that the circumferences
AB, BC, CD, DE, EA are equal;
[iv. II]
through A, B, C, D, E let GH,
HK,
KL, LM, MG be drawn touching the
*•
c
L
circle ;
[ m . 16, Por.]
let the centre F of the circle ABCDE
be taken [in. i ] , and
let FB, FK, FC, FL, FD be joined.
Then.since the straight line KL touches the circle ABCDE
at C,
and FC has been joined from the centre F to the point of
contact at C,
therefore FC is perpendicular to KL ;
[in. 18]
therefore each of the angles at C is right.
F o r the same reason
the angles at the points B, D are also right.
