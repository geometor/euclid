And, since the angle FCK is right,
therefore the square on FK is equal to the squares on FC, CK.
For the same reason
[i. 47]
the square on FK is also equal to the squares on FB, BK;
so that the squares on FC, CK are equal to the squares
on FB, BK,
of which the square on FC is equal to the square on FB;
therefore the square on CK which remains is equal to the
square on BK.
Therefore BK is equal to CK.
And, since FB is equal to FC,
and FK common,
the two sides BF, FK are equal to the two sides CF, FK;
and the base BK equal to the base CK;
therefore the angle BFK is equal to the angle KFC, [1. 8]
and the angle BKF to the angle FKC.
Therefore the angle BFC is double of the angle KFC,
and the angle BKC of the angle FKC.
For the same reason
the angle CFD is also double of the angle CFL,
and the angle DLC of the angle FLC.
Now, since the circumference BC is equal to CD,
the angle BFC is also equal to the angle CFD.
[m. 27]
And the angle BFC is double of the angle KFC, and the
angle DFC of the angle LFC;
therefore the angle KFC is also equal to the angle LFC.
But the angle FCK is also equal to the angle FCL ;
therefore FKC, FLC are two triangles having two angles
equal to two angles and one side equal to one side, namely
FC which is common to them ;
therefore they will also have the remaining sides equal to the
remaining sides, and the remaining angle to the remaining
angle;
[i- 26]
therefore the straight line KC is equal to CL,
and the angle FKC to the angle FLC,
And, since KC is equal to CL,
therefore KL is double of KC.
