F o r the same reason it can be proved that
HK is also double of BK.

And BK is equal to KC;
therefore HK is also equal to KL.
Similarly each of the straight lines HG, GM, ML can
also be proved equal to each of the straight lines HK, KL ;
therefore the pentagon GHKLM is equilateral.
I say next that it is also equiangular.
For, since the angle FKC is equal to the angle FLC,
and the angle HKL was proved double of the angle FKC,
and the angle KLM double of the angle FLC,
therefore the angle HKL is also equal to the angle KLM.
Similarly each of the angles KHG, HGM, GML can also
be proved equal to each of the angles HKL,
KLM;
therefore the five angles GHK, HKL, KLM, LMG,
MGH
are equal to one another.
Therefore the pentagon GHKLM is equiangular.
And it was also proved equilateral; and it has been
circumscribed about the circle
ABCDE.
Q. E. F.
De Morgan remarks that iv. 12, 13, 14 supply the place of the following :
Having given a regular polygon of any number of sides inscribed in a circle, to
describe the same about the circle; and, having given the polygon, to inscribe and
circumscribe a circle. F o r the method can be applied generally, as indeed
Euclid practically says in the Porism to iv. 15 about the regular hexagon and
in the remark appended to iv. 16 about the regular fifteen-angled figure.
T h e conclusion of this proposition, " therefore about the given circle an
equilateral and equiangular pentagon has been circumscribed," is omitted in
the MSS.

PROPOSITION 

13.


In a given pentagon, which is equilateral and equiangular,
to inscribe a circle.
Let ABCDE
pentagon;

be the given equilateral and equiangular

thus it is required to inscribe a circle in the

pentagon

ABCDE.
F o r let the angles BCD,
CDE
be bisected by the
straight lines CF, DF respectively; and from the point F, at
