which the straight lines CF, DF meet one another, let the
straight lines FB, FA, FE be joined.
Then, since BC is equal to CD,
and
common,
the two sides BC, CF are equal to the
two sides DC, CF;
and the angle BCF is equal to the
angle DCF;
therefore the base BF is equal
to the base DF,
and the triangle BCF is equal to the
triangle DCF,
and the remaining angles will be equal to the remaining angles,
namely those which the equal sides subtend.
[1. 4]
Therefore the angle CBF is equal to the angle CDF.
And, since the angle CDE is double of the angle CDF,
and the angle CDE is equal to the angle ABC,
while the angle CDF is equal to the angle CBF;
therefore the angle CBA is also double of the angle CBF;
therefore the angle ABF is equal to the angle FBC;
therefore the angle ABC has been bisected by the straight
line BF.
Similarly it can be proved that
the angles BAE, AED have also been bisected by the straight
lines FA, FE respectively.
Now let FG, FH, FK, FL, FMbe drawn from the point
F perpendicular to the straight lines AB, BC, CD, DE,
EA.
Then, since the angle HCF is equal to the angle KCF,
and the right angle FHC is also equal to the angle FKC,
FHC, FKC are two triangles having two angles equal to two
angles and one side equal to one side, namely FC which is
common to them and subtends one of the equal angles ;
therefore they will also have the remaining sides equal to the
remaining sides;
[1. 26]
therefore the perpendicular FH is equal to the perpendicular

FK.
Similarly it can be proved that
each of the straight lines FL, FM, FG is also equal to each
of the straight lines FH,
FK;
