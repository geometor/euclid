therefore the five straight lines FG, FH, FK, FL, FM are
equal to one another.
Therefore the circle described with centre F and distance
one of the straight lines FG, FH, FK, FL, FM will pass
also through the remaining points ;
and it will touch the straight lines AB, BC, CD, DE,
EA,
because the angles at the points G, H, K, L, M are right.
For, if it does not touch them, but cuts them,
it will result that the straight line drawn at right angles to
the diameter of the circle from its extremity falls within the
circle : which was proved absurd.
[in. 16]
Therefore the circle described with centre F and distance
one of the straight lines FG, FH, FK, FL, FM will not
cut the straight lines AB, BC, CD, DE, EA ;
therefore it will touch them.

Let it be described, as

GHKLM.

Therefore in the given pentagon, which is equilateral and
equiangular, a circle has been inscribed.

About a given pentagon, which is equilateral and equi­
angular, to circumscribe a circle.
Let ABCDE be the given pentagon, which is equilateral
and equiangular;
thus it is required to circumscribe a circle

about the pentagon

ABCDE.

Let the angles BCD, CDE be bisected
by the straight lines CF, DF respectively,
and from the point F, at which the straight
lines meet, let the straight lines FB, FA,
FE be joined to the points B, A, E.
Then in manner similar to the pre­
ceding it can be proved that the angles
CBA, BAE, AED have also been bisected by the straight
lines FB, FA, FE respectively.
