Now, since the angle BCD is equal to the angle CDE,
and the angle BCD is half of the angle BCD,
and the angle CDF half of the angle CDE,
therefore the angle FCD is also equal to the angle CDF,
so that the side FC is also equal to the side FD.
[1. 6]
Similarly it can be proved that
each of the straight lines FB, FA, FE is also equal to each
of the straight lines FC, FD ;
therefore the five straight lines FA, FB, FC, FD, FE are
equal to one another.
Therefore the circle described with centre F and distance
one of the straight lines FA, FB, FC, FD, FE will pass
also through the remaining points, and will have been
circumscribed.

Let it be circumscribed, and let it be

ABCDE.

Therefore about the given pentagon, which is equilateral
and equiangular, a circle has been circumscribed.

For, since the point G is the centre of the circle
GE is equal to GD.
