Again, since the point D is the centre of the circle

GCH,

DE is equal to DG.
But GE was proved equal to GD ;
therefore GE is also equal to
therefore the triangle EGD

ED;

is equilateral;

and therefore its three angles EGD, GDE, DEG are equal
to one another, inasmuch as, in isosceles triangles, the angles
at the base are equal to one another.
[1. 5]
And the three angles of the triangle are equal to two
right angles ;
[1. 32]
therefore the angle EGD

is one-third of two right angles.

Similarly, the angle DGC can also be proved to be onethird of two right angles.
And, since the straight line CG standing on EB makes
the adjacent angles EGC, CGB equal to two right angles,
therefore the remaining angle CGB
right angles.
Therefore the angles EGD,
another;

DGC,

is also one-third of two
CGB are equal to one

so that the angles vertical to them, the angles BGA,
FGE are equal.

AGF,
[1. 15]

Therefore the six angles EGD, DGC, CGB, BGA,
AGF,
FGE are equal to one another.
But equal angles stand on equal circumferences ;
[m. 26]
therefore the six circumferences AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, FA
are equal to one another.
And equal circumferences are subtended by equal straight
lines;
[HI. 29]
therefore the six straight lines are equal to one another;
therefore the hexagon ABCDEF'is

equilateral.

I say next that it is also equiangular.
For, since the circumference FA
ference ED,
let the circumference A BCD
therefore

EDCB A ;

is equal to the circum­

be added to each ;

the whole FA BCD

is equal to the whole
