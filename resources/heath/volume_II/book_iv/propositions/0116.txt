PROPOSITION 

16.

In a given circle to inscribe a fifteen-angled figure which
shall be both equilateral and equiangular.
Let A BCD be the given circle ;
thus it is required to inscribe in the circle A BCD
angled figure which shall be
both equilateral and equi­
angular.

a fifteen-

In the circle A BCD let
there be inscribed a side A C
of the equilateral triangle
inscribed in it, and a side AB
of an equilateral pentagon ;
therefore, of the equal seg­
ments of which there are
fifteen in the circle A BCD,
there will be five in the cir­
cumference ABC
which is
one-third of the circle, and
there will be three in the cir­
cumference AB which is one-fifth of the circle ;
therefore in the remainder BC there will be two of the
equal segments.
Let BC be bisected at E;
[m. 30]
therefore each of the circumferences BE, EC is a fifteenth

of the circle

ABCD.

If therefore we join BE, EC and fit into the circle ABCD
straight lines equal to them and in contiguity, a fifteen-angled
figure which is both equilateral and equiangular will have been
inscribed in it.
Q. E. F.

And, in like manner as in the case of the pentagon, if
through the points of division on the circle we draw
tangents to the circle, there will be circumscribed about the
circle a fifteen-angled figure which is equilateral and equi­
angular.
And further, by proofs similar to those in the case of the
pentagon, we can both inscribe a circle in the given fifteenangled figure and circumscribe one about it.
