I.

If two similar plane numbers by multiplying one another
make some number, the product will be square.
Let A, B be. two similar plane numbers, and let A by
multiplying B make C;
I say that C is square.
For let A by multiplying itself
make D.
,
Therefore D is square.
Since then A by multiplying itself has made D, and by
multiplying B has made C,
therefore, as A is to B, so is D to C.
[vn. 17]
And, since A, B are similar plane numbers,
therefore one mean proportional number falls between A, B.
[vm. 18]
But, if numbers fall between two numbers in continued
proportion, as many as fall between them, so many also fall
between those which have the same ratio;
[vm. 8]
so that one mean proportional number falls between D, C also.
And D is square ;
therefore C is also square.

Q. E. D.
T h e product of two similar plane numbers is a square.
Let a, b be two similar plane numbers.
Now
a : b = a* : ab.
A n d between a, b there is one mean proportional.
Therefore between « : ab there is one mean proportional.
A n d a* is square;
therefore ab is square.
