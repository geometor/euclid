If two numbers by multiplying one another make a square
number, they are similar plane numbers.
Let A, B be. two numbers, and let A by multiplying B
make the square number C;
I say that A, B are similar plane
numbers.
For let A by multiplying itself
make D;
'
therefore D is square.
Now, since A by multiplying itself has made D, and by
multiplying B has made C,
therefore, as A is to B, so is D to C.
[vn. 17]
And, since D is square, and C is so also,
therefore D, C are similar plane numbers.
Therefore one mean proportional number falls between
D, C.
'
[ v m . 18]
And, as D is to C, so is A to B;
therefore one mean proportional number falls between A, B
also.
[vm. 8]
But, if one mean proportional number fall between two
numbers, they are similar plane numbers ;
[vm. 20]
therefore A, B are similar plane numbers.

Q. E. D.
If ab is a square number, a, b are similar plane numbers. (The converse
of ix. 1.)
For
a : b = a' : at).
[vn. 17]
And a , ab being square numbers, and therefore similar plane numbers,
they have one mean proportional.
[vm. 18]
Therefore a, b also have one mean proportional.
[ v m . 8]
whence a, b are similar plane numbers.

If a cube number by multiplying itself make some number,
the product will be cube.
For let the cube number A by multiplying itself make B;
I say that B is cube.
