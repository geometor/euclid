For let C, the side of A, be taken, and let C by multiplying
itself make D.
It is then manifest that C by multiplying A —
D has made A.
Now, since C by multiplying itself has c D—
made D,
therefore C measures D according to the units in itself.
But further the unit also measures C according to the units
in it ;
therefore, as the unit is to C, so is C to D.
[vu. Def. 20]
Again, since C by multiplying D has made A,
therefore D measures A according to the units in C.
But the unit also measures C according to the units in it;
therefore, as the unit is to C, so is D to A.
But, as the unit is to C, so is C to D ;
therefore also, as the unit is to C, so is C to D, and D to A.
Therefore between the unit and the number A two mean
proportional numbers C, D have fallen in continued proportion.
Again, since A by multiplying itself has made B,
therefore A measures B according to the. units in itself.
But the unit also measures A according to the units in it;
therefore, as the unit is to A, so is A to B.
[vu. Def. 20]
But between the unit and A two mean proportional numbers
have fallen ;
therefore two mean proportional numbers will also fall between
A, B.
[vm. 8]
But, if two mean proportional numbers fall between two
numbers, and the first be cube, the second will also be cube.

And A is cube ;
therefore B is also cube.

T h e product of a into itself, or a . a , is a cube.
For
1 : a = a : a = a' : a'.
Therefore between 1 and a there are two mean proportionals.
Also
1 : a? = a ; a .a*.
Therefore two mean proportionals fall between a and a*. a .
[ v m . 8]
(It is true that v m . 8 is only enunciated of two pairs of numbers, but the
proof is equally valid if one number of one pair is unity.)
A n d a is a cube number ;
therefore a . a is also cube.
