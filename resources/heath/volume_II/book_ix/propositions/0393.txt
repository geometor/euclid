If a cube number by multiplying a cube number make some
number, the product will be cube.
For let the cube number A by multiplying the cube number
B make C;
I say that C is cube.
A
For let A by multiplying
B
itself make D ;
c
therefore D is cube.
[ix. 3]
And, since A by multiply­
ing itself has made D, and by multiplying B has made C
therefore, as A is to B, so is D to C.
[vu. 17]
And, since A, B are cube numbers,
A, B are similar solid numbers.
Therefore two mean proportional numbers fall between
A, B;
[vm. 19]
so that two mean proportional numbers will fall betweer. D,
C also.
[vm. 8]
And D is cube ;
therefore C is also cube

T h e product of two cubes, say a . P, is a cube.
For
a : P = a . a : a . P.'
[vn. 1 7 ]
And two mean proportionals fall between a , b which are similar solid
numbers.
[vm. 1 9 '
Therefore two mean proportionals fall between a . a , a . P
[vm. 8
B J t a . a is a cube :
[ix. 3
therefore a . P is a cube.

If a cube number by multiplying any number make a cube
number, the multiplied number will also be cube.
For let the cube number A by multiplying any number B
make the cube number C;
I say that B is cube.
For let A by multiplying
_
itself make D ;
c
therefore D is cube.
