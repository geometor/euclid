Now, since A by multiplying itself has made D, and by
multiplying B has made C,
therefore, as A is to B, so is D to C.
[vn. 17]
And since D, C are cube,
they are similar solid numbers.
Therefore two mean proportional numbers fall between
D, C.
[vm. 19]
And, as D is to C, so is A to B;
therefore two mean proportional numbers fall between A, B
also.
[vm. 8]
And A is cube ;
therefore B is also cube.

If the product a * is a cube number, b is cube.
By ix. 3, the product a . a is a cube.
And
a*. a : a*b = a : b.
[vn. 17]
T h e first two terms are cubes, and therefore "similar solids"; therefore
there are two mean proportionals between them.
[ v m . 19]
Therefore there are two mean proportionals between a , b.

A n d a is a cube :
therefore b is a cube number.

PROPOSITION

6.

If a number by multiplying itself make a cube number, it
will itself also be cube.
For let the number A by multiplying itself make the cube
number B;
I say that A is also cube.
A
For let A by multiplying B make C.
Since, then, A by multiplying itself
has made B, and by multiplying B has
made C,
therefore C is cube.
And, since A by multiplying itself has made B,
therefore A measures B according to the units in itself.
But the unit also measures A according to the units in it.
Therefore, as the unit is to A, so is A to B.
[vn. Def. 20]
And, since A by multiplying B has made C,
therefore B measures C according to the units in A.
But the unit also measures A according to the units in it.
