Therefore, as the unit is to A, so is B to C.
[vu. Def. 20]
But, as the unit is to A, so is A to B;
therefore also, as A is to B, so is B to C.
And, since B, C are cube,
they are similar solid numbers.
Therefore there are two mean proportional numbers
between B, C.
[vm. 19]
And, as B is to C, so is A to B.
Therefore there are two mean proportional numbers
between A, B also.
[vm. 8]
And B is cube ;
therefore A is also cube.
[cf. v m . 23]
Q. E. D.
If a' is a cube number, a is also a cube.
For
1 : a = a : a = a' : a .
Now a , a are both cubes, and therefore "similar solids"; therefore there
;ire two mean proportionals between them.
[ v m . 19]
Therefore there are two mean proportionals between a, a .
[ v m . 8]
And a is a cube :
therefore a is also a cube number.
[ v m . 23]
It will be noticed that the last step is not an exact quotation of the result
of v m . 23, because it is there the first of four terms which is known to be a
cube, and the last which is proved to be a c u b e ; here the case is reversed.
But there is no difficulty. Without inverting the proportions, we have only
to refer to v m . 21 which proves that a, a , having two mean proportionals
between them, are two similar solid numbers; whence, since a is a cube,
a is also a cube.

If a composite number by multiplying any number make
some number, the product will be solid.
For let the composite number A by multiplying any number
B make C;
I say that C is solid.
For, since^4 is composite,
it will be measured by some
number.
[vn. D e f . 13]
Let it be measured by D;
and, as many times as D measures A, so many units let there
be in E.
