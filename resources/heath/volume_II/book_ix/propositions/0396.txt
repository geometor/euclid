Since then .D measures A according to the units in E,
therefore £ by multiplying D has made A.
[VIL Def. 15]
And, since A by multiplying B has made C,
and A is the product of £>, £ ,
therefore the product of D, £ by multiplying B has made C.
Therefore C is solid, and D, £, B are its sides.
Q. E. D.
Since a composite number is the product of two factors, the result of
multiplying it by another number is to produce a 'number which is the
product of three factors, i.e. a " s o l i d number."

PROPOSITION 

8.

If as many numbers as we please beginning from an unit be
in continued proportion, the third from the unit will be square,
as will also those which successively leave out one; the fourth
will be cube, as will also all those which leave out two; and the
seventh will be at once cube and square, as will also those which
leave out five.
Let there be as many numbers as we please, A, B, C, D,
E, F, beginning from an unit and in con­
tinued proportion ;
A
I say that B, the third from the unit, is
3ZZH_
square, as are also all those which leave
out one ; C, the fourth, is cube, as are
also all those which leave out two ; and
F, the seventh, is at once cube and
square, as are also all those which leave out five.
For since, a s the unit is to A, so is A to B,
therefore the unit measures the number A the same number
of times that A measures. B.
[vu. Def. 20]
But the unit measures the number A according to the
units in i t ;
therefore A also measures B according to the units in A.
Therefore A by multiplying itself has made B;
therefore B is square.
And, since B, C, D are in continued proportion, and B is
square,
therefore D is also square.
