For the same reason
F is also square.
Similarly we can prove that all those which leave out one
are square.
I say next that C, the fourth from the unit, is cube, as are
also all those which leave out two.
For since, as the unit is to A, so is B to C,
therefore the unit measures the number A the same number
of times that B measures C.
But the unit measures the number A according to the units
in A ;
therefore B also measures C according to the units in A.
Therefore A by multiplying B has made C.
Since then A by multiplying itself has made B, and by
multiplying B has made C,
therefore C is cube.
And, since C, D, E, F are in continued proportion, and C
is cube,
therefore F is also cube.
[vm. 23]
But it was also proved square ;
therefore the seventh from the unit is both cube and square.
Similarly we can prove that all the numbers which leave
out five are also both cube and square.
Q. E. D.
If 1, a, a.,, a„ ... be a geometrical progression, then a , a , « „ ... are

And, since a , a , a are in geometrical progression and a, (= a ) is a square,
a is a square.
