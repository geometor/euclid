And A is cube.
But, if a cube number by multiplying itself make some
number, the product is cube.
[ix. 3]
Therefore B is also cube.
And, since the four numbers A, B, C, D are in continued
proportion,
and A is cube,
D also is cube.
[vm. 23]
For the same reason
E is also cube, and similarly all the rest are cube.
Q. E. D.
If 1, a , a „ a,, a , ... are in geometrical progression, a„ a , a ... are all
squares;
and, if 1, a , a,, a ,a„ . . . are in geometrical progression, a.„ a , ... are all cubes.

And, a', a„ a being in geometrical progression, and a being a square,
a is a square.

(2) B y ix. 8, i7 , a , a„ ... are all cubes.
Now
1 : a = a : a.
Therefore
« = a . a , which is a cube, by i x . 3.
And, a , « „ a „ a being in geometrical progression, and a being cube,
a is cube.

Similarly we prove that a, is cube, and so on.
T h e results are of course obvious in our notation, the series being

PROPOSITION 

IO.

If as many numbers as we please beginning from an unit be
in continued proportion, and the number after the unit be not
square, neither will any other be square except the third from
the unit and all those which leave out one. And, if the number
after the unit be not cube, neither will any other be cube except
the fourth from the unit and all those which leave out two.
Let there be as many numbers as we please, A, B, C, D,
E, F, beginning from an unit and in continued proportion,
and let A, the number after the unit, not be square ;
