I say that neither will any other be square except the third
from the unit < a n d those which
leave out one > .
A
For, if possible, let C b e square.
B
But B is also square ;
[ix. 8]
o
[therefore B, C have to one another
the ratio which a square number
has to a square number].
And, as B is to C, so is A to B;
therefore A, B have to one another the ratio which a square
number has to a square number ;
[so that A, B are similar plane numbers].
[ v m . 26, converse]
And B is square ;
therefore A is also square :
which is contrary to the hypothesis.
Therefore C is not square.
Similarly we can prove that neither is any other of the
numbers square except the third from the unit and those which
leave out one.

Next, let A not be cube.
I say that neither will any other be cube except the fourth
from the unit and those which leave out two.
For, if possible, let D be cube.
Now C is also cube ; for it is fourth from the unit. [ix. 8]
And, as C is to D, so is B to C;
therefore B also has to C the ratio which a cube has to a cube.
And C is cube ;
therefore B is also cube.
[vm. 25]
And since, as the unit is to A, so is A to B,
and the unit measures A according to the units in it,
therefore A also measures B according to the units in itself;
therefore A by multiplying itself has made the cube number B.
But, if a number by multiplying itself make a cube number,
it is also itself cube.
[ix. 6]
Therefore A is also cube :
which is contrary to the hypothesis.
Therefore D is not cube.
