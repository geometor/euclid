Similarly we can prove that neither is any other of the
numbers cube except the fourth from the unit and those which
leave out two.
Q. E. D.
If i, a, a , a , a , ... be a geometrical progression, then ( i ) , if a is not a
square, none of the terms will be square except a , a , a, ,
and (2), if a is not a cube, none of the terms will be cube except a , a , a„,
With reference to the first part of the proof, viz. that which proves that, if
a is a square, a must be a square, Heiberg remarks that the words which
I have bracketed are perhaps spurious; for it is easier to use v u i . 24 than
the converse of v m . 26, and a use of v m . 24 would correspond better to the
use of v m . 25 in the second part relating to cubes. I agree in this view and
have bracketed the words accordingly. (See however note, p. 383, on
converses of villi 26, 27 given by Heron.) It this change be made, the
proof runs as follows.

Therefore a is to a in the ratio of a square to a square.

T h e propositions v m . 24, 25 are here not quoted in their exact form in
that the first and second squares, or cubes, change places. But there is no
difficulty, since the method by which the theorems are proved shows that
either inference is equally correct.

PROPOSITION

II.

If as many numbers as we please beginning from an unit be
in continued proportion, the less measures the greater according
to some one of the numbers which have place among the propor­
tional numbers.
