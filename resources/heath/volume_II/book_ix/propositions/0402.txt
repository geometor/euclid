Let there be as many numbers as we please, B, C, D, E,
beginning from the unit A and in con­
tinued proportion ;
I say that B, the least of the numbers B,
B
C, D, E, measures E according to some
c
one of the numbers C, D.
D
For since, as the unit A is to B, so
•
is D to E,
therefore the unit A measures the number B the same number
of times as D measures E ;
therefore, alternately, the unit A measures D the same number
of times as B measures E.
[vn. 15]
But the unit A measures D according to the units in it;
therefore B also measures E according to the units in D ;
so that B the less measures E the greater according to some
number of those which have place among the proportional
numbers.—

PORISM. And it is manifest that, whatever place the
measuring number has, reckoned from the unit, the same
place also has the number according to which it measures,
reckoned from the number measured, in the direction of the
number before it.—
Q. E. D.
T h e proposition and the porism together assert that, if 1, a, a , ... a . be a
geometrical progression, a measures a„ and gives the quotient a „ _ (r < n).
Euclid only proves that a„ = a . a _ , , as follows.
1 : a = a„_
Therefore 1 measures a the same number of times as a„_, measures a„.
Hence 1 measures a „ _ , the same number of times as a measures a , ;
