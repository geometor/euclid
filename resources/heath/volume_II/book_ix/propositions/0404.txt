Therefore the product of A, B is equal to the product of
£, G.
Therefore, as A is to E, so is G to B.
[vn. 19]
But A, E are prime,
primes are also least,
[vn. 21]
and the least numbers measure those which have the same
ratio with them the same number of times, the antecedent the
antecedent and the consequent the consequent:
lvn. 20]
therefore E measures B.
Let it measure it according to H;
therefore E by multiplying H has made B.
But further A has also by multiplying itself made B;
[ix. 8]

therefore the product of E, H is equal to the square on A.
Therefore, as E is to A, so is A to H.
[vn. 19]
But A, E are prime,
primes are also least,
[vn. 21]
and the least measure those which have the same ratio the
same number of times, the antecedent the antecedent and the
consequent the consequent;
[vu. 20]
therefore E measures A, as antecedent antecedent.
But, again, it also does not measure i t :
which is impossible.
Therefore E, A are not prime to one another.
Therefore they are composite to one another.
But numbers composite to one another are measured by
some number.
[vn. Def. 14]
And, since E h by hypothesis prime,
and the prime is not measured by any number other than itself,
therefore £ measures A, E,
sa that E measures A.
[But it also measures D ;
therefore £ measures A, D.~\
Similarly we can prove that, by however many prime
numbers D is measured, A will also be measured by the same.
Q. E. D.
If 1, a, a
a„ be a geometrical progression, and a be measured by any
prime number / , a will also be measured by p.
