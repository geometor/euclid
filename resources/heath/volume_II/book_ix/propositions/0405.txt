For, if possible, suppose that p does not measure a) then, / being prime,
/, a are prime to one another.
[ v n . 29]
Suppose
«„ = m.p.
Now
a = a . «„_,.
[ix. 1 1 ]
Therefore
a . «„_, = / » . / ,
and
a : p = m : <»»_,.
[ v n . 19]
Hence, a, p being prime to one another,
/ measures «„_,.
[ v n . 20, 2 1 ]
By a repetition of the same process, we can prove that / measures a _
and therefore a „ _ , and so on, and finally that / measures a.
But, by hypothesis, / does not measure a: which is impossible.
Hence / , a are not prime to one another:
therefore they have some common factor.
[ v n . Def. 14]
But / is the only number which measures / ;
therefore / measures a.
Heiberg remarks that, as, in the ! K 0 « T « , Euclid sets himself to prove that
E measures A, the words bracketed above are unnecessary and therefore
perhaps interpolated.

PROPOSITION 

1 3 .

If as many numbers as we please beginning from an unit be
in continuedproportion, and the number after the unit be prime,
the greatest will not be measured by any except those which, have
a place among the proportional numbers.
Let there be as many numbers as we please, A, B, C, D,
beginning from an unit and in continued proportion, and let A,
the number after the unit, be prime ;
I say that D, the greatest of them, will not be measured by any
other number except A, B, C.

For, if possible, let it be measured by E, and let E not be
the same with any of the numbers A, B, C.
It is then manifest that E is not prime.
For, if £ is prime and measures D
it will also measure A [ix. 12], which is prime, though it is not
the same with i t :
which is impossible.
