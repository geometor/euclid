Therefore E is not prime.
Therefore it is composite.
But any composite number is measured by some prime
number;
[vn. 31]
therefore E is measured by some prime number.
I say next that it will not be measured by any other prime
except A.
For, if E is measured by another,
and E measures D,
that other will also measure D;
so that it will also measure A [ix. 12], which is prime, though
it is not the same with it:
which is impossible.
Therefore A measures E.
And, since E measures D, let it measure it according to F.
I say that F is not the same with any of the numbers
A, B, C.
For, if F\s the same with one of the numbers A, B, C,
and measures D according to E,
therefore one of the numbers A,B, C also measures D according
to E.
But one of the numbers A, B, C measures D according to
some one of the numbers A, B, C;
[ix. 11]
therefore E is also the same with one of the numbers A, B, C:
which is contrary to the hypothesis.
Therefore F is not the same as any one of the numbers
A. B, C.
Similarly we can prove that F is measured by A, by
proving again that F is not prime.
For, if it is, and measures D,
it will also measure A [ix. 12], which is prime, though it is not
the same with i t :
which is impossible;
therefore F is not prime.
Therefore it is composite.
But any composite number is measured by some prime
number;
[vu. 31]
therefore F is measured by some prime number.
