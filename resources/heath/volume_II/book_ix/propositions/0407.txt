I say next that it will not be measured by any other prime
except A.
For, if any other prime number measures F,
and F measures D,
that other will also measure D;
so that it will also measure A [ix. 12], which is prime, though it
is not the same with i t :
which is impossible.
Therefore A measures F.
And, since E measures D according to F,
therefore E by multiplying F has made D.
But, further, A has also by multiplying C made D; [ix. u ]
therefore the product of A, C is equal to the product of E, F.
Therefore, proportionally, as A is to E, so is F to C.
[vn. 19]

But A measures E;
therefore ./''also measures C.
Let it measure it according to G.
Similarly, then, we can prove that G is not the same with
any of the numbers A, B, and that it is measured by A.
And, since F measures C according to G
therefore F by multiplying G has made C.
But, further, A has also by multiplying B made C; [ix. n ]
therefore the product of A, B is equal to the product of F, G.
Therefore, proportionally, as A is to F, so is G to B.
[vn. 19]

But A measures F;
therefore G also measures B.
Let it measure it according to / / .
Similarly then we can prove that H is not the same
with A.
And, since G measures B according to H,
therefore G by multiplying H has made B.
But further A has also by multiplying itself made B;
[l*.

therefore the product of / / , G is equal to the square on A.
Therefore, as H is to A, so is A to G.
