But A measures G ;
therefore H also measures A, which is prime, though it is not
the same with i t :
which is absurd.
Therefore D the greatest will not be measured by any
other number except A, B, C.
Q. E. D.
If i, a, a ... a „ be a geometrical progression, and if a is prime, fl„ will not
be measured by any numbers except the preceding terms of the series.
If possible, let a „ be measured by b, a number different from all the
preceding terms.
Now b cannot be prime, for, if it were, it would measure a.
[ix. 12]
Therefore b is composite, and hence will be measured by some prime
number [vn. 3 1 ] , say / .
T h u s / must measure a„ and therefore a [ix. 1 2 ] ; so that / cannot be
different from a, and b is not measured by any prime number except a.
Suppose that
a — b.e.
Now c cannot be identical with any of the terms a, a , ... a _ , ; for, if it
were, b would be identical with another of them:
[ix. 1 1 ]
which is contrary to the hypothesis.
We can now prove (just as for b) that c cannot be prime and cannot be
measured by any prime number except a.
Since
b. e = a = a . a .
[ix. 1 1 ]
a :b = c: a „ _ , ,
whence, since a measures b,
c measures a „ _ , .
Let
a„_, = c.d.
W e now prove in the same way that d is not identical with any of the terms
a, a j , ... a „ _ , is not prime, and is not measured by any prime except a, and
also that
d measures a _ .
Proceeding in this way, we get a last factor, say k, which measures a
though different from i t :
which is absurd, since a is prime.
T h u s the original supposition that a„ can be measured by a number b
different from all the terms a, a„, ... a,,., must be incorrect.
Therefore etc.

PROPOSITION 

1 4 .

If a number be the least that is measured by prime numbers,
it will not be measured by any other prime number except those
originally measuring it.
For let the number A be the least that is measured by the
prime numbers B, C, D;
