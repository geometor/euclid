I say that A will not be measured by any other prime number
except B, C, D.
For, if possible, let it be measured by the prime number
E, and let £ not be the same with any one of the numbers
B, C, D.
A
E

B
C
D

F

Now, since E measures A, let it measure it according
to F\
therefore E by multiplying F has made A.
And A is measured by the prime numbers B, C, D.
But, if two numbers by multiplying one another make some
number, and any prime number measure the product, it will
also measure one of the original numbers ;
[vu. 30]
therefore B, C, D will measure one of the numbers E, F.
Now they will not measure £ ;
for £ is prime and not the same with any one of the numbers
B, C, D.
Therefore they will measure F, which is less than A :
which is impossible, for A is by hypothesis the least number
measured by B, C, D.
Therefore no prime number will measure A except
B, C, D.
Q. E. D.
In other words, a number can be resolved into prime factors in only
one way.
Let a be the least number measured by each of the prime numbers
b, c, d, ... k.

If possible, suppose that a has a prime f a c t o r / different from b, c, d, ... i.
Let

a=p

,m.

Now b, c, d, ... k, measuring a, must measure one of the two factorsp, m.
[vn. 30]
They do not, by hypothesis, measure p;
therefore they must measure m, a number less than a :
which is contrary to the hypothesis.
Therefore a has no prime factors except b, c, d, ... k.
