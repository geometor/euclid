Similarly we can prove that B, C added together are
prime to A.
I say next that A, C added together are also prime to B.
For, since DF is prime to each of the numbers DE, EF,
the square on DF is also prime to the product of DE, EF.
[vn. 2 4 , 2 5 ]
But the squares on DE, EF together with twice the pro­
duct of DE, EF are equal to the square on DF;
[11. 4 ]
therefore the squares on DE, EF together with twice the
product of DE, EF are prime to the product of DE, EF.
Separando, the squares on DE, EF together with once
the product of DE, EF are prime to the product of DE, EF.
Therefore, separando again, the squares on DE, EF are
prime to the product of DE, EF.
And the square on DE is A,
the product of DE, EF is B,
and the square on EF is C.
Therefore A, C added together are prime to B.
Q. E. D.
If a, b, c be a geometrical progression in the least terms which have a
given common ratio, (b + c), (c + a), (a + b) are respectively prime to a, b, c.
Let a : /3 be the common ratio in its lowest terms, so that the geometrical
progression is
a",

Now, a, /3 being prime to one another,
a + /3 is prime to both a and p.
[vn. 2 8 ]
Therefore
(a + /3), a are both prime to /3.
Hence
(o + /?) o is prime to p,
[vn. 2 4 ]
and therefore to ft*;
[vu. 2 5 ]
i.e.
o' + aP is prime to p ,
or
a + b is prime to c.
Similarly,
0/8 + /3» is prime to a»,
or
b + c is prime to a.
Lastly,
a + p being prime to both a and P,
(a + P)* is prime to a/},
[vn. 24, 2 5 ]
or
o* + p + 2a/8 is prime to o j 8 :
whence
a ' + P is prime to a/}.
T h e latter inference, made in two steps, may be proved by reductio ad
absurdum as Commandinus proves it.
If a + p is not prime to a/3, let x measure t h e m ;
therefore x measures a' + p + ia.p as well as a / 3 ;
hence a ' + / 3 + 2 a/3 and a/3 are not prime to one another, which is contrary
to the hypothesis.
