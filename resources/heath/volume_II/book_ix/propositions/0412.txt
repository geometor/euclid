If two numbers be prime to one another, the second will not
be to any other number as the first is to the second.
For let the two numbers A, B be prime to one another ;
I say that B is not to any other number as
A is to B.
A
For, if possible, as A is to B, so let B be
B
to C.
c
Now A, B are prime,
primes are also least,
[vn. 21]
and the least numbers measure those which have the same
ratio the same number of times, the antecedent the antecedent
and the consequent the consequent;
[vn. 20]
therefore A measures B as antecedent antecedent.
But it also measures itself;
therefore A measures A, B which are prime to one another:
which is absurd.
Therefore B will not be to C, as A is to B.
Q. E. D.
If a, b are prime to one another, they can have no integral third
proportional.
If possible, let
a : b = b : x.
Therefore [ v n . 20, 21] a measures b; and a. b have the common measure
a, which is contrary to the hypothesis.

If there be as many numbers as we please in continued
proportion, and the extremes of them be prime to one another,
the last will not be to any other number as the first to the
second.
For let there be as many numbers as we please, A,B, C,D,
in continued proportion,
and let the extremes of them, A,
D, be prime to one another;
£
I say that D is not to any other
number as A is to B.
For, if possible, as A is to B, so let D be to E;
therefore, alternately, as A is to D, so is B to E.
