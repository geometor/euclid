But A, D are prime,
primes ar& also least,
[vn. 21]
and the least numbers measure those which have the same
ratio the same number of times, the antecedent the antecedent
and the consequent the consequent.
[vn. 20]
Therefore A measures B.
And, as A is to B, so is B to C.
Therefore B also measures C ;
so that A also measures C.
And since, as B is to C, so is C to D,
D measures C,
r
andA B
therefore C also measures D.
But A measured C;
so that A also measures D.
But it also measures itself;
therefore A measures A, D which are prime to one another:
which is impossible.
Therefore D will not be to any other number as A is to B.
Q. E. D.
If a, a , a ... a be a geometrical progression, and a, a „ are prime to one
another, then a, a , a can have no integral fourth proportional.
For, if possible, let
a : a = a : x.
Therefore
a : a = a, : x,
and hence [vn. 20, 21] a measures a,.
Therefore a measures a ,
[ v n . Def. 20]
and hence a measures « , and therefore also ultimately a .
Thus a, a are both measured by a : which is contrary to the hypothesis.

PROPOSITION

I 8.

Given two numbers, to investigate whether it is possible to
find a third proportional to them.
Let A, B be the given two numbers, and let it be required
to investigate whether it is possible to find a third proportional
to them.
Now A, B are either prime to one another or not.
And, if they are prime to one another, it has been proved
that it is impossible to find a third proportional to them.
