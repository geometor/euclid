Next, let A, B not be prime to one another,
and let B by multiplying itself make C.
Then A either measures C or does not measure it.

First, let it measure it according to D;
therefore A by multiplying D has made C.
But, further, B has also by multiplying itself made C;
therefore the product of A, D is equal to the square on B.
Therefore, as A is to B, so is Z? to Z? ;
[vn. 19]
therefore a third proportional number D has been found to
A, B.
Next, let A not measure C;
I say that it is impossible to find a third proportional number
to A, B.
For, if possible, let D, such third proportional, have been
found.
Therefore the product of A, D is equal to the square on B.
But the square on B is C;
therefore the product of A, D is equal to C.
Hence A by multiplying D has made C;
therefore A measures C according to D.
But, by hypothesis, it also does not measure it:
which is absurd.
Therefore it is not possible to find a third proportional
number to A, B when A does not measure C.
Q. E. D.
Given two numbers a, b, to find the condition that they may have an
integral third proportional.
(1) a, b must not be prime to one another.
[ix. 16]
(2) a must measure P.
For, if a, b, c be in continued proportion,
Therefore a measures P.
Condition ( 1 ) is included in condition (2) since, if b - ma, a and b cannot
be prime to one another.
T h e result is of course easily seen if the three terms in continued
proportion be written
