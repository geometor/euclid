Given three numbers, to investigate when it is possible to
find a fourth proportional to them.
Let A, B, C be the given three numbers, and let it be
required to investigate when it is
possible to find a fourth proportional
to them.
Now either they are not in continued proportion, and the extremes
of them are prime to one another ;
or they are in continued proportion, and the extremes of them
are not prime to one another ;
or they are not in continued proportion, nor are the extremes
of them prime to one another ;
or they are in continued proportion, and the extremes of them
are prime to one another.
If then A, B, C are in continued proportion, and the
extremes of them A, C are prime to one another,
it has been proved that it is impossible to find a fourth pro[ix. 1 7 ]
portional number to them.
tNext, let A, B, C not be in continued proportion, the
extremes being again prime to one another;
I say that in this case also it is impossible to find a fourth
proportional to them.
For, if possible, let D have been found, so that,
as A is to B, so is C to D,
and let it be contrived that, as B is to C, so is D to E.
Now, since, as A is to B, so is C to D,
and, as B is to C, so is D to E,
therefore, ex aequali, as A is to C, so is C to E.
[vu. 14]
But A, C are prime,
primes are also least,
[vn. 21]
and the least numbers measure those which have the same
ratio, the antecedent the antecedent and the consequent the
consequent
[vn. 20]
Therefore A measures C as antecedent antecedent.
