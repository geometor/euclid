But it also measures itself;
therefore A measures A, C which are prime to one another :
which is impossible.
Therefore it is not possible to find a fourth proportional
to A, B, C.t
Next, let A, B, C be again in continued proportion,
but let A, C not be prime to one another.
I say that it is possible to find a fourth proportional to
them.
For let B by multiplying C make D ;
therefore A either measures D or does not measure it.
First, let it measure it according to E;
therefore A by multiplying E has made D.
But, further, B has also by multiplying C made D ;
therefore the product of A, £ is equal to the product of
B, C;
therefore, proportionally, as A is to B, so is C to £ ; [vn. 19]
therefore £ has been found a fourth proportional to A, B, C.
Next, let A not measure D;
I say that it is impossible to find a fourth proportional number
to A, B,C.
For, if possible, let E have been found ;
therefore the product of A, E is equal to the product of B, C.
[vn. 19]
But the product if B, C is D ;
therefore the product of A, E is also equal to D.
Therefore A by multiplying E has made D ;
therefore A measures D according to E,
so that A measures D.
But it also does not measure i t :
which is absurd.
Therefore it is not possible to find a fourth proportional
number to A, B, C when A does not measure D.
Next, let A, B, C not be in continued proportion, nor the
extremes prime to one another.
And let B by multiplying C make D.
Similarly then it can be proved that, if A measures D,
it is possible to find a fourth proportional to them, but, if it
does not measure it, impossible.
