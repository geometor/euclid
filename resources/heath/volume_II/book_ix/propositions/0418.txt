August adopts Theon's form of the proof. Heiberg does not feel able to
do this, in view of the superiority of the authority for the text as given above
( P ) ; he therefore retains the latter without any attempt to emend it.

PROPOSITION

20.

Prime numbers are more than any assigned multitude of
prime numbers.
Let A, B, C be the assigned prime numbers ;
I say that there are more
prime numbers than A, B, C. A—
For let the least number
measured by A, B, C be
c
taken,
E
*F
and let it be DE;
let the unit DF be added to DE.
T h e n EF is either prime or not.
First, let it be prime ;
then the prime numbers A, B, C, EF have been found which
are more than A, B, C.
Next, let EF not be prime ;
therefore it is measured by some prime number.
[vn. 31]
Let it be measured by the prime number G.
I say that G is not the same with any of the numbers
A, B, C.
For, if possible, let it be so.
Now A, B, C measure DE;
therefore G also will measure DE.
But it also measures EF.
Therefore G, being a number, will measure the remainder,
the unit DF:
which is absurd.
Therefore G is not the same with any one of the numbers
A, B, C.
A n d by hypothesis it is prime.
Therefore the prime numbers A, B, C, G have been found
which are more than the assigned multitude of A, B, C.
