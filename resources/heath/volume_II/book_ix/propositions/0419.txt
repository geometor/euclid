We have here the important proposition that the number of prime numbers
is infinite.

T h e proof will be seen to be the same as that given in our algebraical
text-books. Let a, b, e,... k be any prime numbers.
Take the product abc... h and add unity.
Then (abc... k + 1) is either a prime number or not a prime number.
(1) If it is, we have added another prime number to those given.
(2) If it is not, it must be measured by some prime number [vn. 3 1 ] , say / .
N o w / cannot be identical with any of the prime numbers a, b,c,... k.
For, if it is, it will divide abc ...k.
Therefore, since it divides (abc...h+
1) also, it will measure the difference,
or unity:
which is impossible.
Therefore in any case we have obtained one fresh prime number.
And the process can be carried on to any extent.

PROPOSITION 

2 1 .

If as many even numbers as we please be added together,
the whole is even.
For let as many even numbers as we please, AB, BC, CD,
DE, be added together;
I say that the whole AE
?
c
0—E
is even.
For, since each of the numbers AB, BC, CD, DE is even,
it has a half part.;
[vn. Def. 6]
so that the whole AE also has a half part.
But an even number is that which is divisible into two
equal parts;
[id.]
therefore AE is even.

Q. E. D.
In this and the following propositions up to i x . 34 inclusive we have a
number of theorems about odd, even, "even-times e v e n " and "even-times
odd " numbers respectively. T h e y are all simple and require no explanation
in order to enable them to be followed easily.

PROPOSITION 

22.

If as many odd numbers as we please be added together, and
their multitude be even, the whole will be even.
For let as many odd numbers as we please, AB, BC, CD,
DE, even in multitude, be added together;
I say that the whole AE is even.
