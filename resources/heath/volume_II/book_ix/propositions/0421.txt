For the same reason BC also has a half part;
so that the remainder [CA also has a half part, and] AC is
therefore even.

If from an even number an odd number be subtracted, the
remainder will be odd.
For from the even number AB let the odd number BC be
subtracted;
I say that the remainder CA is odd.
For let the unit CD be sub­
tracted from BC;

c D B

therefore DB is even.

[vu. Def. 7]

But AB is also even ;
therefore the remainder AD is also even.

And CD is an unit;
therefore CA is odd.

If from an odd number an odd number be subtracted, the

For from the odd number AB let the odd number BC be

I say that the remainder CA is even.
For, since AB is odd, let the unit
BD be subtracted ;
therefore the remainder AD is even.
