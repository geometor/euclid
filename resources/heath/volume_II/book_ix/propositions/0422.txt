If from an odd number an even number be subtracted, the
remainder will be odd.
For from the odd number AB let the even number BC be
subtracted;
I say that the remainder CA is odd.
Let the unit AD be subtracted ;
—
1
therefore DB is even.
[vu. Def. 7]
But BC is also even ;
therefore the remainder CD is even.

If an odd number by multiplying an even number make
some number, the product will be even.
For let the odd number A by multiplying the even number
B make C;
I say that C is even.
For, since A by multiplying B has
o
made C,
therefore C is made up of as many numbers equal to B as
there are units in A.
[vn. Def. 15]
And B is even ;
therefore C is made up of even numbers.
But, if as many even numbers as we please be added
together, the whole is even.
[ix. 21]
Therefore C is even.
