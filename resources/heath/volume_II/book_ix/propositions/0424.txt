[»x. 3 1 . 3*

Let a number measure them, and let it be D.
Now A is odd;
therefore D is also odd.
And since D which is odd measures C,
and C is even,
therefore [Z>] will measure the half of C also.
[ix. 30]
But B is half of C;
therefore D measures B.
But it also measures A ;
therefore D measures A, B which are prime to one another:
which is impossible.
Therefore A cannot but be prime to C.
Therefore A, C are prime to one another.

Each of the numbers which are continually doubled beginning
from a dyad is even-times even only.
For let as many numbers as we please, B, C, D, have been
continually doubled beginning
from the dyad A ;
I say that B, C, D are eventimes even only.
_ _
Now that each of the
numbers B, C, D is even-times even is manifest; for it is
doubled from a dyad.
I say that it is also even-times even only.
For let an unit be set out.
Since then as many numbers as we please beginning from
an unit are in continued proportion,
and the number A after the unit is prime,
therefore £>, the greatest of the numbers A, B, C, D, will not
be measured by any other number except A, B, C.
[ix. 13]
And each of the numbers A, B, C is even ;
therefore D is even-times even only.
[vn. Def. 8]
Similarly we can prove that each of the numbers B, C is
even-times even only.
