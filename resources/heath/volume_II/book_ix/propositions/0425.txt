See the notes on v u . Deff. 8 to 11 for a discussion of the difficulties
shown by Iamblichus to be involved by the Euclidean definitions of " eventimes even," " even-times odd " and " odd-times even."

If a number have its half odd, it is even-times odd only.
For let the number A have its half odd ;
I say that A is even-times odd only.
Now that it is even-times odd is
*
manifest; for the half of it, being odd,
measures it an even number of times.
[vn. Def. 9]
I say next that it is also even-times odd only.
For, if A is even-times even also,
it will be measured by an even number according to an even
number ;
[vn. Def. 8]
so that the half of it will also be measured by an even number
though it is odd :
which is absurd.
Therefore A is even-times odd only.
Q. E. D.
PROPOSITION

If a number neither be one of those which are continually
doubled from a dyad, nor have its half odd, it is both eventimes even and even-times odd.
For let the number A neither be one of those doubled
from a dyad, nor have its half odd';
I say that A is both even-times even
A
and even-times odd.
Now that A is even-times even is manifest;
for it has not its half odd.
[vn. Def. 8]
I say next that it is also even-times odd.
For, if we bisect A, then bisect its half, and do this con­
tinually, we shall come upon some odd number which will
measure A according to an even number.
For, if not, we shall come upon a dyad,
and A will be among those which are doubled from a dyad:
which is contrary to the hypothesis.
