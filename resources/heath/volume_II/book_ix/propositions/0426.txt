Thus A is even-times odd.
But it was also proved even-times even.
Therefore A is both even-times even and even-times odd.

If as many numbers as we please be in continuedproportion,
and there be subtracted from the second and the last numbers
equal to the first, then, as the excess of the second is to the
first, so will the excess of the last be to all those before it.
Let there be as many numbers as we please in continued
proportion, A, BC, D, EF,
beginning from A as least,
Aand let there be subtracted

from BC and EF the numbers

I say that, as GC is to A, so
is EH to A, BC, D.
For let FK be made equal to BC, and FL equal to D.
Then, since FK is equal to BC,
and of these the part FH is equal to the part BG,
therefore the remainder HK is equal to the remainder GC.
And since, as EF is to D, so is D to BC, and BC to A,
while D is equal to FL, BC to FK, and A to FH,
therefore, as EF is to FL, so is LF to FK, and FK to FH.
Separando, as EL is to LF, so is LK to FK, and KH
B

to FH.

Therefore also, as one of the antecedents is to one of the
consequents, so are all the antecedents to all the consequents;
[vn. 12}
therefore, as KH is to FH, so are EL, LK. KH to LF,
FK, HF.
But KH is equal to CG, FH to A, and LF, FK, HF to
D, BC, A ;
therefore, as CG is to A, so is EH to D, BC, A.
Therefore, as the excess of the second is to the first, so is
the excess of the last to all those before it.
