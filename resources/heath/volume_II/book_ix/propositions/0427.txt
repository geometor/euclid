This proposition is perhaps the most interesting in the arithmetical Books,
since it gives a method, and a very elegant one. of summing any series of
terms in geometrical progression.
Let a , , a „ a ,...a ,
a
be a series of terms in geometrical progression.
Then Euclid's proposition proves that

algebra to represent proportions.
Euclid's method then comes to this.

PROPOSITION

36.

If as many numbers as we please beginning from an unit
be set out continuously in double proportion, until the sum of all
becomes prime, and if the sum multiplied into the last make
some number, the product will be perfect.
For let as many numbers as we please, A, B, C, D,
beginning from an unit be set out in double proportion, until
the sum of all becomes prime,
let E be equal to the sum, and let E by multiplying D
make EG;
I say that EG is perfect.
For, however many A, B, C, D are in multitude, let so
many E, HK, L, M be taken in double proportion beginning
from E;
therefore, ex aequali, as A is to D, so is E to M.
[vn. 14]
