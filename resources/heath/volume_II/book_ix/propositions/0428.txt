Therefore the product of E, D is equal to the product of
A, M.
[vn. 19]
And the product of E, D is EG;
therefore the product of A, Mis also EG.
Therefore A by multiplying M has made EG ;
therefore M measures EG according to the units in A.
And A is a dyad ;
therefore EG is double of M.

But M, L, HK, E are continuously double of each other;
therefore E, HK, L, M, EG are continuously proportional in
double proportion.
Now let there be subtracted from the second HK and the
last EG the numbers HN, FO, each equal to the first E;
therefore, as the excess of the second is to the first, so is the
excess of the last to all those before it.
[ix. 35]
Therefore, as NK is to E, so is OG to M, L, KH, E.
A n d NK is equal to E;
therefore OG is also equal to M, L, HK, E.
But FO is also equal to E,
and E is equal to A, B, C, D and the unit.
Therefore the whole EG is equal to E, HK, L, M and
A, B, C, D and the unit;
and it is measured by them.
I say also that EG will not be measured by any other
number except A, B, C, D, E, HK, L, M and the unit.
For, if possible, let some number P measure EG,
and let P not be the same with any of the numbers A, B, C,
D, E, HK, L, M.
And, as many times as P measures EG, so many units let
there be in Q;
therefore Q by multiplying P has made EG.
