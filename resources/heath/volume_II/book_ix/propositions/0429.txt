But, further, E has also by multiplying D made EG;
therefore, as E is to Q, so is P to D.
[vn. 19]
And, since A, B, C, D are continuously proportional
beginning from an unit,
therefore D will not be measured by any other number except
A, B, C.
[ix. 13]
And, by hypothesis, P is not the same with any of the
numbers A, B, C;
therefore P will not measure D.
But, as P is to D, so is E to Q;
therefore neither does E measure Q.
[vn. Def. 20]
And E is prime;
and any prime number is prime to any number which it does
not measure.
[vn. 29]
Therefore E, Q are prime to one another.
But primes are also least,
[vn. 21]
and the least numbers measure those which have the same
ratio the same number of times, the antecedent the antecedent
and the consequent the consequent;
[vn. 20]
and, as E is to Q, so is P to D;
therefore E measures P the same number of times that Q
measures D.
But D is not measured by any other number except
A, B, Ci
therefore Q is the same with one of the numbers A, B, C.
Let it be the same with B.
And, however many B, C, D are in multitude, let so many
E, HK, L be taken beginning from E.
Now E, HK, L are in the same ratio with B, C, D\
therefore, ex aequali, as B is to D, so is E to L.
[vu. 14]
Therefore the product of B, L is equal to the product of
D, E.
[vu. 19]
But the product of D, E is equal to the product of Q, P;
therefore the product of Q, P is also equal to the product of
B, L.
Therefore, as Q is to B, so is L to P.
[vn. 19]
And Q is the same with B ;
therefore L is also the same with P:
