Theon of Smyrna and Nicomachus both define a " perfect" number and
give the law of its formation. Nicomachus gives four perfect numbers and no
more, namely 6, 28, 496, 8128. H e says they are formed in " o r d e r e d "
fashion, there being one among the units (i.e. less than 10), one among the
tens (less than 100), one among the hundreds (less than 1000) and one among
the thousands (less than r o o o o ) ; he adds that they terminate in 6 or 8
alternately.
T h e y do all terminate in 6 or 8, as can easily be proved by
means of the formula (2*— 1 ) 2 " " ' (cf. Loria, Le scienze esatte nelV antica
Grecia, pp. 840—1), but not alternately, for the fifth and sixth perfect numbers
both end in 6, and the seventh and eighth both end in 8. Iamblichus adds
a tentative suggestion that perhaps there may be, in like manner, one perfect
number among the "first myriads" (less than ioooo ), one among the "second
myriads" (less than ioooo ), and so on. T h i s is, as we shall see, incorrect.
It is natural that the subject of perfect numbers should, ever since Euclid's
time, have had a fascination for mathematicians. Fermat (1601 — 1655), in a
letter to Mersenne (CEuvres de Fermat, ed. Tannery and Henry, V o l . 11.,
1894, pp. 197—9), enunciated three propositions which much facilitate the
investigation whether a given number of the form 2 " - 1 is prime or not. If
we write in one line the exponents 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. of the successive powers of
2 and underneath them respectively the numbers representing the correspond­
ing powers of 2 diminished by 1, thus,

the following relations are found to subsist between the numbers in the first
line and those directly below them in the second line.
1. If the exponent is not a prime number, the corresponding number is
not a prime number either (since a'*' — 1 is always divisible by a" — 1 as well
as by a' - 1).
2. If the exponent is a prime number, the corresponding number dimi­
nished by 1 is divisible by twice the exponent. [(2* — aViW = (2"" — 1 ) / « ; so
that this is a special case of " Fermat's theorem " that, i f / is a prime number
and a is prime to / , then a ~' is divisible by / . ]
3. If the exponent n is a prime number, the corresponding number is
only divisible by numbers of the form ( 2 « i « + i ) . If therefore the corre­
sponding number in the second line has no factors of this form, it has no
integral factor.
T h e first and third of these propositions are those which are specially
useful for the purpose in question. A s usual, Fermat does not give his proofs
but merely a d d s : " Voila trois fort belles propositions que j'ay trouvees et
prouvees non sans peine. Je les puis appeller les fondements de l'invention
des nombres parfaits."
