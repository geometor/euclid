I append a few details of discoveries of further perfect numbers after the
first four. T h e next are as follows :
fifth,
2 " ( 2 - i ) = 33 550 336
sixth,
2 " (2 - 1) = 8 589 869 056
seventh, 2 ( 2 " - 1) = 137 438 691 328
eighth, 2 ' ( 2 — 1 ) = 2 305 843 008 139 952 128
ninth,
2 ( 2 " - 1) = 2 658 455 991 569 831 7 4 4 6 5 4 6 9 2 615 953 842 176
tenth,
2"(2 -i).
It has further been
proved that 2 - i is prime, and so is 2 - i .
Hence
m
iv
2 ( 2 - i ) and
are two more perfect numbers.
T h e fifth perfect number may have been known to Icmblichus, though he
does not give i t ; it was however known, with all its factors, in the fifteenth
century, as appears from a tract written in German which was discovered by
Curtze (Cod. lat. Monac. 14908). T h e first eight perfect numbers were
calculated by Jean Prestet (d. 1670). Fermat had stated, and Euler proved,
that 2 ' - 1 is prime. T h e ninth perfect number was found by P. Seelhoff
(Zeitschrift far Math. u. Physik, x x x i . , 1886, pp. 174—8) and verified by
E . Lucas (Mathisis, vn., 1887, pp. 45—6). T h e tenth was discovered by
R. E . Powers (see Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society, x v n i . , 1912,
p. 162). 2 —1 was proved to be prime by E . Fauquembergue and R. E .
Powers (1914), while Fauquembergue proved that 2 - i is prime.
T h e r e have been attempts, so far unsuccessful, to solve the question
whether there exist other " perfect numbers " than those of Euclid, and, in
particular, perfect numbers which are odd. (Cf. several notes by Sylvester in
Comptes rendus, cvi., 1888 ; Catalan, " Melanges mathematiques " in Mim. de
la Soc. de Liige, 2' Serie, xv., 1888, pp. 205—7 ; C . Servais in Mathisis, vn.,
pp. 228—30 and v m . , pp. 92—93, 1 3 5 ; E. Cesaro in Mathisis, vn.,
pp. 245—6 ; E . Lucas in Mathisis, x., pp. 74—6).
For the detailed history of the whole subject see L. E. Dickson, History
of the Theory of Numbers, V o l . 1., 1919, pp. iii—iv, 3—33.
