3. A ratio is a sort of relation in respect of size between
two magnitudes of the same kind.
4. Magnitudes are said to have a ratio to one another
which are capable, when multiplied, of exceeding one another.
5. Magnitudes are said to be in the same ratio, the
first to the second and the third to the fourth, when, if any
equimultiples whatever be taken of the first and third, and
any equimultiples whatever of the second and fourth, the
former equimultiples alike exceed, are alike equal to, or alike
fall short of, the latter equimultiples respectively taken in
corresponding order.
6. Let magnitudes which have the same ratio be called
proportional.
7. When, of the equimultiples, the multiple of the first
magnitude exceeds the multiple of the second, but the multiple
of the third does not exceed the multiple of the fourth, then
the first is said to have a greater ratio to the second than
the third has to the fourth.
8.

A proportion in three terms is the least possible.

9. When three magnitudes are proportional, the first is
said to have to the third the duplicate ratio of that which
it has to the second.
10. When four magnitudes are < continuously > propor­
tional, the first is said to have to the fourth the triplicate
ratio of that which it has to the second, and so on con­
tinually, whatever be the proportion.
1 1 . T h e term corresponding magnitudes is used of
antecedents in relation to antecedents, and of consequents in
relation to consequents.
1 2 . Alternate ratio means taking the antecedent in
relation to the antecedent and the consequent in relation to
the consequent.
1 3 . Inverse ratio means taking the consequent as
antecedent in relation to the antecedent as consequent.
