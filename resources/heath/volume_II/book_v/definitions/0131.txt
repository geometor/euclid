Dedekind arrives at the following definition of an irrational number.
An irrational number a is defined whenever a law is stated which will
assign every given rational number to one and only one of two classes A and
B such that (1) every number in A precedes every number in B, and (2) there
is no last number in A and no first number in B; the definition of o being
that it is the one number which lies between all numbers in A and all
numbers in B.
Now let xjy and x'jy' be equal ratios in Euclid's sense.
T h e n ^ will divide all rational numbers into two groups A and B;

A' and B".

Let j be any rational number in A, so that

This means that ay < bx.
But Euclid's definition asserts that in that case ay' < bx' also.
Hence also

therefore every member of group A is also a member of group A'.
Similarly every member of group B is a member of group ff.
For, if

But in that case, by Euclid's definition, ay' > bx';

Thus, in

If xjy, x'jy happen to be

rational,

then one of the groups, say A, includes xjy,
