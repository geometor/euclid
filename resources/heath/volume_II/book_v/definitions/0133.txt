Let the first A be the same multiple of B the second that C the third is of

A is to B as C is to D.

Then, because A is the same multiple of B that C is of D,
and E is the same multiple of A that Fis of C,
E is the same multiple of B that F'\s of D.
Therefore E, Fare

therefore, if E be a greater multiple of B than G is, Fis a greater multiple of
D than His of D;
that is, if £ be greater than G, F is greater than H.
In like manner,
if E be equal to G, or less, Fis equal to H, or less than it.
But E, Fare

equimultiples, any whatever, of A, C;

and G, H any equimultiples whatever of B, D.
Therefore A is to B as C is to D.
[v. Def. 5]
Next, let the first A be the same part of the second B that the third C is
of the fourth D:
A is to B as C is to Z?.
A
For Z? is the same multiple of A that D is of C;
B
wherefore, by the preceding case,
B is to A as D is to C ;
D
and, inversely, A is to B as C is to Z>.
[For this last inference Simson refers to his Proposition B .
That
proposition is very simply proved by taking any equimultiples E, F of B, D
and any equimultiples G, Hoi A, C and then arguing as follows:
Since A is to B as C is to D,
G, H are simultaneously greater than, equal to, or less than E, F
respectively; so that
E, F are simultaneously less than, equal to, or greater than G, H
respectively,
and therefore [Def. 5] B is to A as D is to C ]
We have now only to add to Prop. C the case where AB contains the
same parts of CD that EF Aots of GH:
c

in this case likewise AB is to CD as EFto
GH.
Let CK be a part of CD, and G Z the same part of GH; let AB be the
same multiple of C X t h a t £ / M S of GL.
