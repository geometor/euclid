Therefore, by Prop. C,
AB is to CAT as EF
-B

to

GL.

E"
G-

And CD, GH are equimultiples of CK, GL, the second and fourth.
Therefore AB is to CD as EF to GH [Simson's Cor. to v. 4, which
however is the particular case of v. 4 in which the " equimultiples " of one
pair are the pair itself, i.e. the pair multiplied by unity].
T o prove the partial converse we begin with Prop. D.
If the first be to the second as the third to the fourth, and if the first be a
multiple or part of the second, the third is the same multiple or the same part of
the fourth.
Let A be to B as C is to D;
and, first, let A be a multiple of B;
C is the same multiple of D.
Take E equal to A, and whatever multiple A or E is of B, make F the
same multiple of D.
Then, because A is to B as C is to D,
and of B the second and D the fourth equimultiples have been taken E
and F,
A is to E as C is to F.
[v. 4, Cor.]
But A is equal to E;
therefore C is equal to F.
[In support of this inference Simson cites his Prop. A, which however we
can directly deduce from v. Def. 5 by taking any, but the same, equimultiples
of all four magnitudes.]

A

C

B

D

E-

F

Now F is the same multiple of D that A is of B;
therefore C is the same multiple of D that A is of B.
Next, let the first A be a part of the second

B;

C the third is the same part of the fourth D.
Because A is to B as C is to D,
inversely, B is to A as D is to C.
But A is a part of B;

[Prop. B ]

therefore B is a multiple of A;

and, by the preceding case, D is the same multiple of C,
that is, C is the same part of D that A is of B.
W e have, again, only to add to Prop D the case where AB contains any
parts of CD, and AB is to CD as EFxo
GH;
then shall EF contain the same parts of GH that AB does of CD.
