Ta 8c TOP avrov iypvTa. Xdyov fieycOrf dvdkoyov Kaktia6<a.
'AraXoyor, though usually written in one word, is equivalent to dva. Xdyov, in
proportion.
It comes however in Greek mathematics to be used practically as
an indeclinable adjective, as h e r e ; cf. al reWape? tvOtiai dvdkoyov urovrat,
" the four straight lines will be proportional," rpiymva TCW rrXcupa? dvdkoyov
c^oira, "triangles having their sides proportional." Sometimes it is used
adverbially: dvdkoyov apa icrrlv w rj BA irpos rijv AT, OUTIDS 17 HA rrpos rr/v AZ,
"proportionally therefore, as BA is to AC, so is GD to DF"; so too, ap­
parently, in the expression rj p.io-i\ dvdkoyov (tiOtlaj, " the mean proportional."
I do not follow the objection of Max Simon (Euclid, p. 110) to "proportional"
as a translation of dvdkoyov. "We ask," he says, "in vain, what is proportional
to what? We say e.g. that weight is proportional to price because double, treble
etc. weight corresponds to double, treble etc. price. But here the meaning must
be 'standing in a relation of proportion.'" Yet he admits that the Latin word
proportionalis is an adequate expression. H e translates by "in proportion"
in the text of this definition. But I do not see that " in proportion " is better
than "proportional." T h e fact is that both expressions are elliptical when
used of four magnitudes " in proportion "; but there is surely no harm in
using either when the meaning is so well understood.
The use of the word Kakeio-Ow, " let magnitudes having the same ratio be
called proportional," seems to indicate that this definition is Euclid's own.

As De Morgan observes, the practical test of disproportion is simpler than
that of proportion. For, whereas no examination of individual cases, however
