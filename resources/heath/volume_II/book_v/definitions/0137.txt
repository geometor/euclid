Multiply (1) by q and (2) by ».
(We need here to assume that, where rX, rY are any equimultiples of any
magnitudes X, Y,
according as X > = < Y,

rX>

= < rY.

This is contained in Simson's Axioms 1 and 3.)
We have then the pairs of equations
mqA > nqB,

mqC < nqD,

npA < nqB,

npC>

nqD.

From the second equations in each pair it follows that
mqC<

npC.

(We now need to assume that, if rX, sX are any multiples of X, and
rY, sY the same multiples of Y, then,
according as rX > = < sX,

rY>

= < sY.

Simson uses this same assumption in his proof of v. 18.)
Therefore

mqA < npA.

But it follows from the first equations in each pair that
mqA > npA :
which is impossible.
Nor can Euclid's criterion for a greater ratio coexist with that for equal
ratios.

DEFINITION 8 .
'AraAoyi'a Si iv rptoiv opois eXa\a<7T»i IITTIV.
This is the reading of Heiberg and Camerer (who follow Peyrard's MS.)
and is that translated above. T h e other reading has cXaxio-Ton, which can
only be translated "consists in three terms at least." Hankel regards the defi­
nition as a later interpolation, because it is superfluous, and because the word
opos for a term in a proportion is nowhere else used by Euclid, though it is
common in later writers such as Nicomachus and Theon of Smyrna. T h e
genuineness of the definition is however supported by the fact that Aristotle
not only uses Spot in this sense (Eth. Nic. v. 6, 7, 1131 b 5, 9), but has a similar
remark (ibid. 1131 a 31) that a "proportion is in four terms at least." T h e
difference from Euclid is only formal; for Aristotle proceeds : " T h e discrete
(8iripr)fUvjj) (proportion) is clearly in four (terms), but so also is the continuous
(trwtxfc). F o r it uses one as two and mentions it twice, e.g. (in stating) that,
as a is to /?, so also is 0 to y; thus /? is mentioned twice, so that, if /3 be twice
put down, the proportionals are four." The distinction between discrete and
continuous seems to have been Pythagorean (cf. Nicomachus, 11. 21, 5 ; 23,
2, 3 ; where however wyquiuvrj is used instead of vwtxqs); Euclid does not
use the words Sigprj^eVr; and o-wixv *
this connexion.
So far as they go, the first words of the next definition (9), "When three
magnitudes are proportionals," which seemingly refer to Def. 8, also support
the view that the latter is, at least in substance, genuine.
