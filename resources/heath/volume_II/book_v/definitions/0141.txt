on Deff. 9, 10. T h e fact is that awriOrjpj. and what serves for the passive of
it (o-iry«(/iai) are used for adding as well as compounding in the sense of
compounding ratios. In order to distinguish the two senses, I have always
used the word componendo where the sense is that of this definition, though
this requires a slight departure from the literal rendering of some passages.
Thus the enunciation of v. 17 says, literally, "if magnitudes compounded be
in proportion they will also be in proportion separated" (idv o-vyitci/xera
fityiOri dvdkoyov TJ>, KOI oWocdcVra dvdkoyov carat).
This practically means
that, if A + B is to B as C + D is to D, then A is to B as C is to D.
I have accordingly translated as follows: " if magnitudes be proportional
componendo, they will also be proportional separando."
(It will be observed
that separando, a term explained in the next note, is here used, not relatively
to the proportion A is to B as C is to D, but relatively to the proportion
componendo, viz. A + B is to B as C + D is to D.)
The corresponding
term for componendo in the Greek mathematicians is anvMm, literally "to one
who has compounded," i.e. " if we compound." ( F o r this absolute use of the

later than Euclid to denote the composition of a ratio, as compared with
Euclid's more general use of owoWis and other parts of the verb o-vvrlBtnu
or avyKUfuu, may point to a desire to get rid of ambiguity of terms and to
make the terminology of geometry more exact.

As composition of a ratio means the transformation, e.g., of the ratio of
A to B into the ratio of A + B to B, so the separation of a ratio indicates
the transformation of it into the ratio of A — B to B.
Thus, as the new
antecedent is in one case got by adding the original antecedent to the original
consequent, so the antecedent in the other case is obtained by subtracting the
original consequent from the original antecedent (it being assumed that the
latter is greater than the former). Hence the literal translations of mmtftmn
Xoyov, "division of a ratio," and of ZKXOVTI (the corresponding term to
trwBivTi) as dividendo, scarcely give a sufficiently obvious explanation of the
meaning.
Heiberg accordingly translates by "subtractio rationis," which
again may be thought to depart too far from the Greek. Perhaps "separation"
and separando may serve as a compromise.

Conversion of a ratio means taking, e.g., instead of the ratio of A to B,
the ratio of A to A — B (A being again supposed greater than B).
As
