arises when, as antecedent is to consequent, so is antecedent to consequent,
and, as consequent is to something else, so is consequent to something else."
This case needed no description after Def. 17 itself; and the supposed
definition is never used.
After the definitions of Book v. Simson supplies the following axioms.
1. Equimultiples of the same or of equal magnitudes are equal to one
another.
2. Those magnitudes of which the same or equal
equimultiples are equal to one another.

magnitudes are

3. A multiple of a greater magnitude is greater than the same multiple
of a less.
4. That magnitude of which a multiple is greater than the same multiple
of another is greater than that other magnitude.
