PROPOSITION 

I.

If there be any number of magnitudes whatever which are,
respectively, equimultiples of any magnitudes equal in multitude,
then, whatever multiple one of the magnitudes is of one, that
multiple also will all be of all.
Let any number of magnitudes whatever AB, CD be
respectively equimultiples of any magnitudes E, F equal in
multitude;
I say that, whatever multiple AB
AB, CD also be of E, F.
A

O

B

E

is of E, that multiple will

C

H

D

F

For, since AB is the same multiple of E that CD is of F,
as many magnitudes as there are in AB equal to E, so many
also are there in CD equal to F.
Let AB be divided into the magnitudes A G, GB equal
to E,
and CD into CH, HD

equal to F;

then the multitude of the magnitudes AG, GB will be equal
to the multitude of the magnitudes CH, HD.
Now, since AG

is equal to E, and CH to F,

therefore A G is equal to E, and A G, CH to E,

F.

F o r the same reason
GB is equal to E, and GB, HD

to E,

F;

therefore, as many magnitudes as there are in AB equal to E,
so many also are there in AB, CD equal to £, F;
