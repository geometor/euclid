Q. E. D.
De Morgan remarks of v. 1—6 that they are "simple propositions of
concrete arithmetic, covered in language which makes them unintelligible to
modern ears. T h e first, for instance, states no more than that ten acres and
ten roods make ten times as much as one acre and one rood." One aim
therefore of notes on these as well as the other propositions of Book v.
should be to make their purport clearer to the learner by setting them side by
side with the same truths expressed in the much shorter and more familiar
modern (algebraical) notation. In doing so, we shall express magnitudes by
the first letters of the alphabet, a, b, c etc., adopting small instead of capital
letters so as to avoid confusion with Euclid's lettering ; and we shall use the
small letters m, n, p etc. to represent integral numbers. Thus ma will always
mean m times a or the m" multiple of a (counting 1 . a as the first, 2 . a as the
second multiple, and so on).
Prop. 1 then asserts that, if ma, mb, me etc. be any equimultiples of a, b, c
etc., then
ma + mb + me+ ... =m (a + b + e+ ...).

2.

If a first magnitude be the same multiple of a second
that a third is of a fourth, and a fifth also be the same multiple
of the second that a sixth is of the fourth, the sum of the first
and fifth will also be the same multiple of the second that the
sum of the third and sixth is of the fourth.
Let a first magnitude, AB,
second, C, that a third, DE,
is of a fourth, F, and let a
fifth, BG, also be the same
multiple of the second, C, that
a sixth, EH, is of the fourth

I say that the sum of the
first and fifth, A G, will be the same multiple of the second, C,
that the sum of the third and sixth, DH, is of the fourth, F.
For, since AB is the same multiple of C that DE is of F,
therefore, as many magnitudes as there are in AB equal to C,
so many also are there in DE equal to F.
F o r the same reason also,
as many as there are in BG equal to C, so many are there
also in EH equal to F;
