therefore, as many as there are in the whole A G equal to C,
so many also are there in the whole DH equal to F.
Therefore, whatever multiple AG is of C, that multiple
also is DH of F.
Therefore the sum of the first and fifth, AG, is the same
multiple of the second, C, that the sum of the third and sixth,
DH, is of the fourth, F.
Therefore etc.
Q. E. D.
T o find the corresponding formula for the result of this proposition, we
may suppose a to be the " second " magnitude and b the " fourth." If now
the " first" magnitude is ma, the " third " is, by hypothesis, mb; and, if the
" fifth " magnitude is na, the "sixth" is nb. T h e proposition then asserts that
ma + na is the same multiple of a that mb + nb is of b.
More generally, if pa, qa... and pb, qb... be any further equimultiples of
a, b respectively, ma + na+pa + qa+ ... is the same multiple of a that mb +
nb +pb + qb + ... is of b. This extension is stated in Simson's corollary to
v. 2 thus:
" From this it is plain that, if any number of magnitudes AB, BG, GH
be multiples of another C; and as many DE, EK, KL be the same
multiples of F, each of e a c h ; the whole of the first, viz. AH, is the same
multiple of C that the whole of the last, viz. DL, is of F."
T h e course of the proof, which separates m into its units and also n into
its units, practically tells us that the multiple of a arrived at by adding the
two multiples is the (m + »)th multiple; or practically we are shown that
ma + na = (m + n) a,
or, more generally, that
ma + na + pa + ... = (m + «+/+...)
a.

PROPOSITION 

3.

If a first magnitude be the same multiple of a second
that a third is of a fourth, and if equimultiples be taken
of the first and third, then also ex aequali the magnitudes
taken will be equimultiples respectively, the one of the second
and the other of the fourth.
Let a first magnitude A be the same multiple of a second
B that a third C is of a fourth D, and let equimultiples EF,
GH be taken of A, C;
I say that EF is the same multiple of B that GH is of D.
For, since EF is the same multiple of A that GH is of C,
therefore, as many magnitudes as there are in EF equal to
A, so many also are there in GH equal to C.
