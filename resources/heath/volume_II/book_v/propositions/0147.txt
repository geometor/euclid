Let EF be divided into the magnitudes EK, KF equal
to A, and GH into the magnitudes GL, LH equal to C;

then the multitude of the magnitudes EK, A"/ will be equal
to the multitude of the magnitudes GL,
LH.

And, since A is the same multiple of B that C is of D,
while EK is equal to A, and GL to C,
therefore EK is the same multiple of B that GL is of D.
For the same reason
KF is the same multiple of B that LH is of D.
Since, then, a first magnitude EK is the same multiple
of a second B that a third GL is of a fourth D,
and a fifth KF is also the same multiple of the second B that
a sixth Z , / / is of the fourth D,
therefore the sum of the first and fifth, EF, is also the same
multiple of the second B that the sum of the third and sixth,
GH, is of the fourth D.

Therefore etc.
Q. E. D.
Heiberg remarks of the use of ex aequali in the enunciation of this propo­
sition that, strictly speaking, it has no reference to the definition (17) of a
ratio ex aequali. But the uses of the expression here and in the definition
are, I think, sufficiently parallel, as may be seen thus. T h e proposition
asserts that, if
and if

na, nb are equimultiples of a, b,
m . na, m . nb are equimultiples of na, nb,

then m. na is the same multiple of a that m.nb\% of b. Clearly the proposi­
tion can be extended by taking further equimultiples of the last equimultiples
and so on ; and we can prove that
/ . q... m. na is the same multiple of a that p .q...m. nb is of b,
where the series of numbers p.q...m.n
is exactly the same in both
expressions;
and ex aequali (67 laov) expresses the fact that the equimultiples are at the
same distance from a, b in the series na, m .na... and nb, m.nb... respectively.
