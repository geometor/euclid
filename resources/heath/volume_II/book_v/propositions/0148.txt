[v. 3. 4

Here again the proof breaks m into its units, and then breaks n into its
units; and we are practically shown that the multiple of a arrived at, viz.
tn. na, is the multiple denoted by the product of the numbers tn, n, i.e. the
(w«)th multiple, or in other words that
m.na

= mn. a.

PROPOSITION 

4.

If a first magnitude have to a second the same ratio as a
third to a fourth, any equimultiples whatever of the first and
third will also have the same ratio to any equimultiples
whatever of the second and fourth respectively, taken in
corresponding order.
F o r let a first magnitude A have to a second B the same
ratio as a third C to a fourth D ; and let equimultiples E, F
be taken of A, C, and G, H other, chance, equimultiples of

B, D;
I say that, as E is to G, so is F to H.

F o r let equimultiples K, L be taken of E, F, and other,
chance, equimultiples M, N of G, H.
Since £ is the same multiple of A that F is of C,
and equimultiples K, L of E, F have been taken,
therefore K is the same multiple of A that L is of C.
F o r the same reason
M is the same multiple of B that N is of D.
