The proof, of course, follows exactly the method of Euclid's proposition
itself, with the only difference that, instead of one of the two pairs of equi­
multiples, the magnitudes themselves are taken. In other words, the conclu­
sion that
ma is to nb as mc is to nd
is equally true when either m or n is equal to unity.
As De Morgan says, Simson's corollary is only necessary to those who will
not admit Mir&o the list M, iM, $Metc.;
the exclusion is grammatical and
nothing else. T h e same may be said of Simson's Prop. A to the effect that,
" If the first of four magnitudes has to the second the same ratio which the
third has to the fourth : then, if the first be greater than the second, the third
is also greater than the fourth; and if equal, equal; if less, less." This is
needless to those who believe once A to be a proper component of the list of
multiples, in spite of multus signifying many.

PROPOSITION 

5.

If a magnitude be the same multiple of a magnitude that
a part subtracted is of a part subtracted, the remainder will
also be the same multiple of the remainder that the whole is of
the whole.
5

F o r let the magnitude AB be the same multiple of the
magnitude CD that the part AE subtracted is of the part CF
subtracted ;
I say that the remainder EB is also the same multiple of the
remainder FD that the whole AB is of the whole CD.

10

For, whatever multiple AE is of CF, let EB be made
that multiple of CG.
Then, since AE is the same multiple of CF that EB is
of GC,
therefore AE is the same multiple of CF that AB is of GF.
[v. 1]

is

But, by the assumption, AE is the same multiple of CF
that AB is of CD.
Therefore AB is the same multiple of each of the magni­
tudes GF, CD;
therefore GF is equal to CD.

Let CF be subtracted from each ;
therefore the remainder GC is equal to the remainder FD.
