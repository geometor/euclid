Euclid's proof amounts to this.
Suppose a magnitude x taken such that
ma — mb=-mx, say.
Add mb to each side, whence (by v. i)
ma = m (x + b).
Therefore
a = x + b, or x = a - b,
so that
ma -mb = m(a- b).
Simson's proof, on the other hand, argues thus.
Take x = m(a- b), the same multiple of (a — b) that mb is of b.
Then, by addition of mb to both sides, we have [v. i]
x + mb = ma,
or
x = ma — mb.
That is,
ma- mb = m(a — b).

If two magnitudes be equimultiples of two magnitudes, and
any magnitudes subtracted from them be equimultiples of the
same, the remainders also are either equal to the same or equi­
multiples of them.
F o r let two magnitudes AB, CD be equimultiples of two
magnitudes E, F, and let AG,
CH
subtracted from them be equiG B
multiples of the same two E, F;
'
I say that the remainders also, GB,
HD, are either equal to E, F or
—'—i—i—i—
equimultiples of them.
—
For, first, let GB be equal to E;
I say that HD is also equal to F.
F o r let CK be made equal to F.
Since AG is the same multiple of E that CH is of F,
while GB is equal to E and KC to F,
therefore AB is the same multiple of E that KH is of F.
[V. 2]
But, by hypothesis, AB is the same multiple of £ that
CD is of F;
therefore KH is the same multiple of F that CD is of F.
Since then each of the magnitudes KH, CD is the same
multiple of F,
therefore KH is equal to CD.
