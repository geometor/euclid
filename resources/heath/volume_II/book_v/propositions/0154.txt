V

Let CH be subtracted from each ;
therefore the remainder KC is equal to the remainder
But F is equal to KC;
therefore HD is also equal to F.

HD.

Hence, if GB is equal to E, HD is also equal to F.
Similarly we can prove that, even if GB be a multiple
of £, HD is also the same multiple of F.
Therefore etc.
Q. E. D.
This proposition corresponds to v. 2, with subtraction taking the place of
addition. It asserts namely that, if « is less than m, ma — na is the same
multiple of a that mb -nb is of b. T h e enunciation distinguishes the cases in
which m — n is equal to 1 and greater than 1 respectively.
Simson observes that, while only the first case (the simpler one) is proved
in the Greek, both are given in the Latin translation from the Arabic; and
he supplies accordingly the proof of the second case, which Euclid leaves to
the reader. T h e fact is that it is exactly the same as the other except that, in
the construction, CK is made the same multiple of F that GB is of E, and
at the end, when it has been proved that KC is equal to HD, instead of
concluding t h a t ' / / / ? is equal to F, we have to say "Because GB is the same
multiple of E that KC is of F, and KC is equal to HD, therefore HD is
the same multiple of F\\\aX GB is of E."

PROPOSITION

Equal magnitudes have to the same the same ratio, as also
has the same to equal magnitudes.
Let A, B be equal magnitudes and C any other, chance,
magnitude;
I say that each of the magnitudes A, B has the same ratio
to C, and C has the same ratio to each of the magnitudes

A, B.

F o r let equimultiples D, E of A, B be taken, and of C
another, chance, multiple F.
Then, since D is the same multiple of A that E is of B,
while A is equal to B,
therefore D is equal to E.
But F is another, chance, magnitude.
