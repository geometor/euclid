Let AB, C be unequal magnitudes, and let AB
let D be another, chance,
magnitude;

B
I say that AB has to D a
'
greater ratio than C has to
G
D, and Z? has to C a greater
ratio than it has to AB.
For, since AB is greater
than C, let BE be made equal
toC;
then the less of the magnitudes AE, EB, if multiplied,
|

be greater;

H

D

M

will sometime be greater than D.

[v. Def. 4]

{Case 1.]
First, let AE be less than EB ;
let AE be multiplied, and let
be a multiple of it which is
greater than D;
then, whatever multiple EG is of AE, let GH be made the
same multiple of EB and K of C ;
and let Z be taken double of D, M triple of it, and successive
multiples increasing by one, until what is taken is a multiple
of D and the first that is greater than K.
Let it be taken,
and let it be N which is quadruple of D and the first
multiple of it that is greater than K.
Then, since K is less than N first,
therefore K is not less than M.
And, since FG is the same multiple of AE

that GH is of

EB,
therefore FG is the same multiple of AE

that FH

is of

AB.
[V.I]

But FG is the same multiple of AE that K is of C;
therefore FH is the same multiple of AB that K is of C;
therefore FH, K are equimultiples of AB, C.
Again, since GH is the same multiple of EB that K is
of C,
and EB

is equal to C,

therefore GH is equal to K.
