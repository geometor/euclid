PROPOSITION 8

151

But K is not less than M;
therefore neither is GH less than M.
And FG is greater than D;
therefore the whole FH is greater than D, M together.
But D, M together are equal to N, inasmuch as M is
triple of D, and M, D together are quadruple of D, while
JV is also quadruple of D; whence M, D together are equal
to N.
But FH is greater than M, D ;
therefore FH is in excess of N,
while K is not in excess of N.
And FH, K are equimultiples of AB, C, while N is
another, chance, multiple of D;
therefore AB has to D a greater ratio than C has to D.
[v. Def. 7]
I say next, that D also has to C a greater ratio than D
has to AB.
For, with the same construction, we can prove similarly
that N is in excess of K, while N is not in excess of FH.
And A is a multiple of D,
while FH, K are other, chance, equimultiples of AB, C;
therefore D has to C a greater ratio than D has to AB.

[Case 2 . ]
Again, let AE be greater than EB.
Then the less, EB, if multiplied, will sometime be greater
than D.
[v. Def. 4]
Let it be multiplied, and
Alet GH be a multiple of EB
and greater than D;
and, whatever multiple GH is
*
of EB, let 7^7 be made the
same multiple of AE, and K
of C.
L
MThen we can prove simi­
larly that FH, K are equi­
multiples of AB,
C;
and, similarly, let N be taken a multiple of D but the first
that is greater than FG,
so that FG is again not less than M.
