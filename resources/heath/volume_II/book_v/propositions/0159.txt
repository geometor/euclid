Then, because N is the multiple of J) which is the first that becomes
greater than GH,
the next preceding multiple is not greater than

GH;

that is, GH is not less than M.
And, since FG is the same multiple of AE that GH is of

EB,

GH is the same multiple of EB that FH is of AB;
wherefore FH, GH are equimultiples of AB,

[v. i]

EB.

And it was shown that GH was not less than M;
and, by the construction, FG is greater than

D;

therefore the whole FH is greater than M, D together.
But M, D together are equal to

N;

therefore FH is greater than N.
But GH is not greater than N;
and FH, GH axe. equimultiples of AB,

BE,

and A'is a multiple of D;
therefore AB has to D a greater ratio than BE (or C) has to D.

[v. Def. 7]

Also D has to BE a greater ratio than it has to AB.
For, having made the same construction, it may be shown, in like manner,
that N is greater than GH but that it is not greater than FH;
and Nisa
multiple of D,
and GH, FH axe equimultiples of EB,
AB;
Therefore D has to EB a greater ratio than it has to AB."
[v. Def. 7]
The proof may perhaps be more readily grasped in the more symbolical
form thus.
Take the m\\\ equimultiples of C, and of the excess of AB over C (that is,
of AE), such that each is greater than D;
and, of the multiples of D, let pD be the first that is greater than mC, and nD
the next less multiple of D.
Then, since mC is not less than nD,
and, by the construction, m(AE)

is greater than D,

the sum of mC and m(AE) is greater than the sum of nD and D.
That is, m(AB) is greater than pD.
And, by the construction, « C i s less than pD.
Therefore [v. Def. 7] AB has to D a greater ratio than C has to D.
Again, since pD is less than m(AB),
and pD is greater than tn C,
D has to C a greater ratio than D has to

AB.

PROPOSITION 

9.

Magnitudes which have the same ratio to the same are
equal to one another; and magnitudes to which the same has
the same ratio are equal.
