Therefore, as was shown in Prop. 8, there is some multiple F of C, and
some equimultiples E and D of B and A, such that F is greater than E and
not greater than D.
But, because C is to B as C is to A,
and F\\\e. multiple of the first is greater than E the multiple of the second,
/"the multiple of the third is greater than D the multiple of the fourth.
[v. Def. s]
But F'vi not greater than D: which is impossible.
Therefore A is equal to B."

PROPOSITION 

10.

Of magnitudes which have a ratio to the same, that
which has a greater ratio is greater; and that to which the
same has a greater ratio is less.
F o r let A have to C a greater ratio than B has to C;
I say that A is greater than B.

For, if not, A is either equal to B or less.
Now A is not equal to B;
for in that case each of the magnitudes A, B would have
had the same ratio to C;
[v. 7]
but they have not;
therefore A is not equal to B.
Nor again is A less than B;
for in that case A would have had to C a less ratio than B
has to C;
[v. 8]
but it has not;
therefore A is not less than B.
But it was proved not to be equal either;
therefore A is greater than B.
Again, let C have to B a greater ratio than C has to A ;
I say that B is less than A.
For, if not, it is either equal or greater.
Now B is not equal to A ;
for in that case C would have had the same ratio to each of
the magnitudes A, B;
[v. 7]
but it has not;
therefore A is not equal to B.
