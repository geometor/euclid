Ratios which are the same with the same ratio are also
the same with one another.
For, as A is to B, so let C be to D,
and, as C is to D, so let E be to F;
I say that, as A is to B, so is E to F.
A

N

F o r of A, C, E let equimultiples G, H, K be taken, and
of B, D, F other, chance, equimultiples L, M, N.
Then since, as A is to B, so is C to D,
and of A, C equimultiples G, H have been taken,
and of B, D other, chance, equimultiples L, M,
therefore, if G is in excess of L, H is also in excess of M,
if equal, equal,
and if less, less.
Again, since, as C is to D, so is E to F,
and of C, E equimultiples H, K have been taken,
and of D, F other, chance, equimultiples M, N,
therefore, if H is in excess of M, K is also in excess of N,
if equal, equal,
and if less, less.
But we saw that, if H was in excess of M, G was also
in excess of L ; if equal, equal; and if less, less ;
so that, in addition, if G is in excess of L, K is also in excess
of/V,
•r equal,
i

it
equal,
and if less, less.
And G, K are equimultiples of A, E,
while L, N are other, chance, equimultiples of B, F;
therefore, as A is to B, so is E to F.
Therefore etc.
