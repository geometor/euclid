The idiomatic use of the imperfect in quoting a result previously obtained
is noteworthy. Instead of saying " But it was proved that, if ff is in excess
of M, G is also in excess of L," the Greek text has " But if ff was in excess
of M, G was also in excess of L," dXXa. ti iirtptZxt TO © TOV M, vrrtp«x< xal

This proposition is tacitly used in combination with v. 16 and v. 24 in the
geometrical passage in Aristotle, Meteorologica in. 5, 376 a 22—26.

PROPOSITION 

1 2 .

If any number of magnitudes be proportional, as one of
the antecedents is to one of the consequents, so will all the
antecedents be to all the consequents.
Let any number of magnitudes A, B, C, D, E, F be
proportional, so that, as A is to B, so is C to D and E
to F;
I say that, as A is to B, so are A, C, E to B, D, F.

K

N

For of A, C, E let equimultiples G, H, K be taken,
and of/?, D, Toother, chance, equimultiples L, M,

N.

Then since, as A is to B, so is C to D, and E to F,
and of A, C, E equimultiples G, H, K have been taken,
and of B, D, Toother, chance, equimultiples L, M, N,
therefore, if G is in excess of L, H is also in excess of M,
and K of N,
if equal, equal,
and if less, less ;
so that, in addition,
if G is in excess of L, then G, H, K are in excess of L, M, N,
if equal, equal,
and if less, less.
