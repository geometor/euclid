[v. 12, 13

Now G and G, H, K are equimultiples of A and A, C, E,
since, if any number of magnitudes whatever are respec­
tively equimultiples of any magnitudes equal in multitude,
whatever multiple one of the magnitudes is of one, that
multiple also will all be of all.
[v. 1]
F o r the same reason
L and L, M, N are also equimultiples of B and B, D, F;
therefore, as A is to B, so are A, C, E to B, D, F.
[v. Def. 5]

Therefore etc.
Q. E. D.
Algebraically, if a : a' = b : b' = e : c' etc., each ratio is equal 1 0 the ratio
(a + b + c+ . . . ) : (a' + +
...).
This theorem is quoted by Aristotle, Eth. Nic. v. 7, 1 1 3 1 b 14, in the
shortened form " t h e whole is to the whole what each part is to each part
(respectively)."

PROPOSITION 

13.

If a first magnitude have to a second the same ratio as a
third to a fourth, and the third have to the fourth a greater
ratio than a fifth has to a sixth, the first will also have to the
second a greater ratio than the fifth to the sixth.
F o r let a first magnitude A have to a second B the
same ratio as a third C has to a fourth D,
and let the third C have to the fourth D a greater ratio than
a fifth E has to a sixth F;
I say that the first A will also have to the second B a greater
ratio than the fifth E to the sixth F.

For, since there are some equimultiples of C, E,
and of D, F other, chance, equimultiples, such that the
multiple of C is in excess of the multiple of D,
