while the multiple of E is not in excess of the multiple of F,
[v. Def.. 7]

let them be taken,
and let G, H be equimultiples of C, E,
and K, L other, chance, equimultiples of D, F,
so that G is in excess of K, but H is not in excess of L ;
and, whatever multiple G is of C, let M be also that multiple

oiA,
and, whatever multiple K is of D, let N be also that multiple

oiB.
Now, since, as A is to B, so is C to D,
and of A, C equimultiples M, G have been taken,
and of B, D other, chance, equimultiples N, K,
therefore, if M is in excess of N, G is also in excess of K,
if equal, equal,
and if less, less.
[v. Def. 5]
But G is in excess of K;
therefore M is also in excess of N.
But H is not in excess of L ;
and M, H are equimultiples of A,

E,

and N, L other, chance, equimultiples of B, F;
therefore A has to B a greater ratio than E has to F.
[v. Def. 7]
Therefore etc.
Q. E. D.

Algebraically, if
and
then

a : b = c :d,

c : d>e

;/,

a : b > e :/.

After the words " for, since " in the first line of the proof, Theon added
" C has to D a greater ratio than E has to F," so that " there are some
equimultiples" began, with him, the principal sentence.
The Greek text has, after " o f D, Mother, chance, equimultiples," "and
the multiple of C is in excess of the multiple of D..."
T h e meaning being
" such that," I have substituted this for " and," after Simson.
The following will show the method of Euclid's proof.
Since
c : d>
e:f,
there will be some equimultiples mc, me of c, e, and some equimultiples nd, nf
of d, f, such that
mc> nd, while me^nf.
