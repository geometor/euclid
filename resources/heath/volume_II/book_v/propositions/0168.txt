Simson adds as a corollary the following:
" If the first have a greater ratio to the second than the third has to the
fourth, but the third the same ratio to the fourth which the fifth has to the
sixth, it may be demonstrated in like manner that the first has a greater ratio
to the second than the fifth has to the sixth."
This however scarcely seems to be worth separate statement, since it only
amounts to changing the order of the two parts of the hypothesis.

PROPOSITION 

14.

If a first magnitude have to a second the same ratio as a
third has to a fourth, and the first be greater than the third,
the second will also be greater than the fourth; if equal, equal;
and if less, less.
F o r let a first magnitude A have the same ratio to a
second B as a third C has to a fourth D; and let A be
greater than C;
I say that B is also greater than D.
A

c

B

o

For, since A is greater than C,
and B is another, chance, magnitude,
therefore A has to B a greater ratio than C has to B.
[v. 8]
But, as A is to B, so is C to D;
therefore C has also to D a greater ratio than C has to B.
[v. 13]

But that to which the same has a greater ratio is less ;
[v. 10]

therefore D is less than B;
so that B is greater than D.
Similarly we can prove that, if A be equal to C, B will
also be equal to D ;
and, if A be less than C, B will also be less than D.
Therefore etc.
