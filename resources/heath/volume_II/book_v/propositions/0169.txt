Algebraically, if
a :b = c : d,
then, according as a > = < <:, b> = <d.
Simson adds the specific proof of the second and third parts of this
proposition, which Euclid dismisses with "Similarly we can prove...."
" Secondly, if A be equal to C, B is equal to D; for A is to B as C, that
is A, is to D;
therefore B is equal to D.
[v. 9 ]
Thirdly, if A be less than C, B shall be less than D.
For C is greater than A ;
and, because C is to D as A is to B,
D is greater than B, by the first case.
Wherefore B is less than D."
Aristotle, Meteorol. in. 5, 376 a n — 1 4 , quotes the equivalent proposition
that, if a>b,
e>d.

PROPOSITION 

15.

Parts have the same ratio as the same multiples of them
taken in corresponding order.
For let AB be the same multiple of C that DE is of F;
I say that, as C is to F, so is AB to DE.

For, since AB is the same multiple of C that DE is of F,
as many magnitudes as there are in AB equal to C, so many
are there also in DE equal to F.
Let AB be divided into the magnitudes AG, GH,
HB
equal to C,
and DE into the magnitudes Z?/*', KL, LE equal to Z ;
then the multitude of the magnitudes AG, GH, HB will be
equal to the multitude of the magnitudes DK, KL,
LE.
And, since A G. GH, HB are equal to one another,
and DK, KL, LE are also equal to one another,
therefore, as AG is to DK, so is GH to KL, and HB to LE.

[v-7]

Therefore, as one of the antecedents is to one of the
consequents, so will all the antecedents be to all the
consequents ;
[v. 12]
therefore, as AG is to DK, so is AB to DE.
