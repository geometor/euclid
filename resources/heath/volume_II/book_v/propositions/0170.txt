PROPOSITION 

16.

If four magnitudes be proportional, they will also be
proportional alternately.
Let A, B, C, D be four proportional magnitudes,
so that, as A is to B, so is C to D;
I say that they will also be so alternately, that is, as A
to C, so is B to D.

F o r of A, B let equimultiples E, F be taken,
and of C, D other, chance, equimultiples G, H.
Then, since E is the same multiple of A that F is of B,
and parts have the same ratio as the same multiples of
them,
[v. 15]
therefore, as A is to B, so is E to F.
But as A is to B, so is C to D;
therefore also, as C is to D, so is E to F.
[v. 1 1 ]
Again, since G, H are equimultiples of C, D,
therefore, as C is to D, so is G to H.
[v. 15]
But, as C is to D, so is E to F;
therefore also, as E is to F, so is G to H.
[v. n ]
But, if four magnitudes be proportional, and the first be
greater than the third,
the second will also be greater than the fourth ;
if equal, equal;
and if less, less.
[v. 14]
Therefore, if E is in excess of G, F is also in excess of H,
if equal, equal,
and if less, less.
