Now E, F are equimultiples of A,

B,

and G, H other, chance, equimultiples of C, D ;
therefore, as A is to C, so is B to D.

[v. Def. 5]

Therefore etc.
Q. E. D.

3. " Let A, B , C, D be four proportional magnitudes, so that, as A is to B , so is
C to D." In a number of expressions like this it is absolutely necessary, when translating
into English, to interpolate words which are not in the Greek. Thus the Greek here is :
"EOTW rtaffapa ficytOq ivdXoyoy ret A, B, T, A, us to A x/ws to B, oiVwi to V vpat to A,
literally " Let A, B, C, D be four proportional magnitudes, as A to B, so C to Z>." The
same remark applies to the corresponding expressions in the next propositions, v. 17, 18,
and to other forms of expression in v. 10—23 and later propositions : e.g. in V. 20 we have
a phrase meaning literally Let there be magnitudes...which taken two and two are in the
same ratio, as A to B, so D to E," etc.: in v. 21 " (magnitudes)...which taken two and
two are in the same ratio, and let the proportion of them be perturbed, as A to B, so
E to F, etc. In all such cases (where the Greek is so terse as to be almost ungrammatical)
I shall insert the words necessary in English, without further remark.

v

Algebraically, if

a :b = c : d,

then

a : c = b : d.

Taking equimultiples ma, mb of a, b, and equimultiples nc, nd of c, d, we
have, by v. 15,
a : b = ma : mb,
c : d=nc

: nd.

And, since

a : b = c : d,

we have [v. 1 1 ]

ma : mb = nc : nd.

Therefore [v. 14], according as ma> = < nc,
so that

mb> = <nd,-

a : c = b : d.

Aristotle tacitly uses the theorem in Meteorologica in. 5, 376 a 22—24.
The four magnitudes in this proposition must all be of the same kind, and
Simson inserts " of the same kind " in the enunciation.
This is the first of the propositions of Eucl. v. which Smith and Bryant
(Euclid's Elements of Geometry, 1901, pp. 298 sqq.) prove by means of VI. 1
so far as the only geometrical magnitudes in question are straight lines or
rectilineal areas; and certainly the proofs are more easy to follow than
Euclid's. The proof of this proposition is as follows.
T o prove that, If Jour magnitudes of the same kind [straight lines or
rectilineal areas] be proportionals, they will be proportionals
when taken
alternately.
Let P, Q, R, S be the four magnitudes of the same kind such that
P:

Q=

R:S;

then it is required to prove that
P: R = Q : S.
First, let all the magnitudes be areas.
Construct a rectangle abed equal to the area P, and to be apply the
rectangle beef equal to Q.
Also to ab, bf apply rectangles ag, bk equal to R, S respectively.
