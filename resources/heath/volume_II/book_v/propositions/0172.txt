Then, since the rectangles ac, be have the same height, they are to one
another as their bases.
[vi. 1]
Hence
P: Q = ab : bf.
But
P:Q=P:&
Therefore P : S = ab : bf,
[v. 1 1 ]
i.e.
rect. ag : rect. bk = ab : bf.
Hence (by the converse of vi. 1) the rect­
angles ag, bk have the same height, so that k
is on the line hg.
Hence the rectangles ac, ag have the same
height, namely ab; also be, bk have the same
height, namely bf.
Therefore
rect. ac : rect. ag=bc : bg,
and
rect. be : rect. bk = bc : bg.
[vi. 1]
Therefore
rect. ac : rect. ag= rect. be : rect. bk.

That is,
P:P=Q:S.
Secondly, let the magnitudes be straight lines AB, BC, CD, DE.
Construct the rectangles Ab, Be, Cd, De with the same height.

Then

Ab : Be = AB : BC,
Cd: De=CD:
DE.
But
AB : BC= CD : DE.
Therefore
Ab : Be = Cd : De.
Hence, by the first case,
Ab : Cd-^Bc : De,
and, since these rectangles have the same height,
AB : CD = BC : DE.

PROPOSITION

If magnitudes be proportional componendo, they will also
be proportional separando.
Let AB, BE, CD, DF be magnitudes proportional com­
ponendo, so that, as AB is to BE, so is CD to DF;
I say that they will also be proportional separando, that is,
as AE is to EB, so is CF to DF.
For of AE,
EB, CF, FD let equimultiples GH,
HK,
LM, MN be taken,
and of EB, FD other, chance, equimultiples, KO,
NP,
