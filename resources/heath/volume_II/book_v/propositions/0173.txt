Then, since GH is the same multiple of AE

therefore GH is the same multiple of AE

that GK is of

AB.

But GH is the same multiple of AE that LM is of CF;
therefore GK is the same multiple of AB that LM is of CF.

[v. 1]

But LM was the same multiple of CF that GK is of AB;
therefore GK is the same multiple of AB that LN is of CD.
Therefore GK, LN are equimultiples of AB, CD.
Again, since HK is the same multiple of EB that MN is
of FD,
and AT? is also the same multiple of EB that NP is of FD,
therefore the sum HO is also the same multiple of EB that
J f f is of FD.
[v. z]
And, since, as AB is to BE, so is CZ? to DF,
and of ^Z?, CD equimultiples GK, LN have been taken,
and of EB, FD equimultiples HO, MP,
therefore, if GK is in excess of HO, LN

is also in excess of

MP,
if equal, equal,
and if less, less.
Let GK be in excess of

HO;

then, if HK

be subtracted from each,
GH is also in excess of KO.
But we saw that, if GK was in excess of HO, LN
also in excess of MP ;
therefore LN

is also in excess of MP,
