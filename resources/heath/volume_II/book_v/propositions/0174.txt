and, if MN

be subtracted from each,
LM is also in excess of
so that, if GH is in excess of KO, LM

NP;
is also in excess of

NP.
Similarly we can prove that,
if GH be equal to KO, LM will also be equal to
and if less, less.

NP,

And GH, LM are equimultiples of AE, CF,
while KO, NP are other, chance, equimultiples of EB, FD ;
therefore, as AE is to EB, so is CF to FD.
Therefore etc.
Q. E. D.

Algebraically, if

a : b = c : d,

then
(a-b) :b = (c-d)
:d.
I have already noted the somewhat strange use of the participles of
o-vyKiitrOai and 8taipeu7t9at to convey the sense of the technical o-ivdto-is and
Wpco-tf Xoyov, or what we denote by componendo and separando.
iav
o-vyKtifitva ptylOri dvdXoyov fj, ko.1 Siaiptdivra dvdXoyov lerrat is, literally, "if
magnitudes compounded be proportional, they will also be proportional
separated," by which is meant " if one magnitude made up of two parts is to
one of its parts as another magnitude made up of two parts is to one of its
parts, the remainder of the first whole is to the part of it first taken as the
remainder of the second whole is to the part of it first taken." In the
algebraical formula above a, c are the wholes and b, a-b and d, c-dare
the
parts and remainders respectively. T h e formula might also be stated thus :
If

a + b : b = c + d : d,

then

a : b = c : d,

in which case a + b, c + d are the wholes and b, a and d, c the parts and
remainders respectively.
Looking at the last formula, we observe that
"separated," SiaipSivTa, is used with reference not to the magnitudes a, b, c, d
but to the compounded magnitudes a + b, b, c + d, d.
As the proof is somewhat long, it will be useful to give a conspectus of it
in the more symbolical form. T o avoid minuses, we will take for the
hypothesis the form
a + b is to b as c + d is to d.
Take any equimultiples of the four magnitudes a, b, c, d, viz.
ma,

mb,

mc,

md,

and any other equimultiples of the consequents, viz.
nb and nd.
Then, by v. 1, m(a + b), m (c + d) are equimultiples of a + b, c + d,
and, by v. 2, (m + n) b, (m + n)d are equimultiples of b, d.
Therefore, by Def. 5, since a + b is to b as c + d is to d,
according as m (a + b) > = <(«

+ ») b,

m (c + d)> - <(m + n) d.
