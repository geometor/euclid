Subtract from m (a + b), (m + n)b the common part mb, and from
m (c + d), (m + n)d the common part md; and we have,
according as ma> = <nb,
mo = < nd.
But MA, *w are any equimultiples of a, c, and nb, nd any equimultiples of
b, d,
therefore, by v. Def. 5,
a is to b as c is to d.
Smith and Bryant's proof follows, mutatis mutandis, their alternative proof
of the next proposition (see pp. 1 7 3 — 4 below).

If magnitudes be proportional separando, they will also be
proportional componendo.
Let

AE,

EB,

CF,

be

magnitudes

to EB, so is CF to FD;
I say that they will also be

proportional componendo, that

is, as AB is to BE, so is
CD to FD.
For, if CD be not to DF as AB to
then, as AB

BE,

so will CD be either to
or to a greater.

First, let it be in that ratio to a less magnitude
Then, since, as AB

some

DG.

so is CD to DG,

they are magnitudes proportional componendo;
so that they will also be proportional separando. [v. 17]
Therefore, as AE

is to EB,

so is CG to GD.

But also, by hypothesis,
as AE is to

so is C / to /*Z>.

Therefore also, as CG is to GD, so is CF to FD.

[v. n ]

But the first CG is greater than the third CF;
therefore the second GD is also greater than the fourth

FD.
But it is also less : which is impossible.
Therefore, as AB is to BE, so is not CD
magnitude than FD.
