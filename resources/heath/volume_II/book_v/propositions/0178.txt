Clearly, if

nb is greater than mb,
nd is greater thati md;
if equal, equal; and if less, less.
I

Suppose nb not greater than mb, so that nd is also not greater than md.
Now
m (a + b) is greater than mb:
therefore
m (a + b) is greater than nb.
Similarly
m(c + d) is greater than nd.
I I . Suppose nb greater than mb.
Since m (a + b), mb, m(c + d), md are equimultiples of (a + b), b, (c + d), d,
ma is the same multiple of a that m (a + b) is of (a + b),
and
««• is the same multiple of c that m (c + d) is of (c + d),
so that « a , mc are equimultiples of a, c.
[v. 5]
Again
nd are equimultiples of
d,
and so areOTA,md;
therefore (n-m)b,
(n-m)d
are equimultiples of b, d and, whether
n-m
is equal to unity or to any other integer [v. 6], it follows, by Def. 5, that,
since a, b, e, d are proportionals,
if
ma is greater than (n - m) b,
then
mc is greater than
(n-m)d;
if equal, equal; and if less, less.
(1)

If now m (a + b) is greater than nb, subtracting mb from each, we have

ma is greater than
(n-m)b;
therefore
mc is greater than (n - m) d,
and, if we add md to each,
m (c + d) is greater than nd.
(2)

Similarly it may be proved that,

if

m (a +

then

m(c + d) is equal to «a",

is equal to nb,

and (3) that, if

m (a + ^) is less than »A,

then

m(c + d) is less than nd.

But (under I. above) it was proved that, in the case where nb is not
greater than mb,
m(a + b) is always greater than nb,
and

m(c + d) is always greater than nd.
Hence, whatever be the values of m and n, m (c + d) is always greater than,
equal to, or less than nd according as m(a + b) is greater than, equal to, or
less than nb.
Therefore, by Def. 5,
a + b is to b as c + a* is to d.
Todhunter gives the following short demonstration from Austin
nation of the first six books of Euclid's Elements).
" Let AE be to EB as CF is to

FD:

AB shall be to BE as CD is to DF.
