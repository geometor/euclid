For, because AE is to EB as CF is to ED,
therefore, alternately,
AE is to CEas EB is to ED.
[v. 16]
And, as one of the antecedents is to its consequent, so is the sum of the
antecedents to the sum of the consequents:
[v. 12]
therefore, as EB is to ED, so are AE, EB together to CF,
FD together;
that is,
AB is to CD as EB is to FD.
Therefore, alternately,
AB is to BE as CD is to FD."
The objection to this proof is that it is only valid in the case
where the proposition v. 16 used in it is valid, i.e. where all four
magnitudes are of the same kind.
Smith and Bryant's proof avails where all four magnitudes
are straight lines, where all four magnitudes are rectilineal areas,
or where one antecedent and its consequent are straight lines and the other
antecedent and its consequent rectilineal areas.
Suppose that

A : B = C : D.

First, let all the magnitudes be areas.
Construct a rectangle abed equal to A, and to be apply the rectangle beef
equal to B.
Also to ab, bf apply the rectangles ag, bk
d
equal to C, D respectively.
Then, since the rectangles ac, be have equal
heights be, they are to one another as their
bases.
[vi. 1]
Hence ab:bf= rect. ac: rect. be
=
A:B
=
C:D
= rect. ag: rect. bk.
Therefore [vi. 1, converse] the rectangles ag, bk have the same height, so
that k is on the straight line kg.
Hence

A + B :B = r e c t ae: rect. be
= af:bf
= rect. ak : rect. bk
=
C+D-.D.

Secondly, let the magnitudes A, B be straight lines and the magnitudes
C, D areas.
Let ab, bf he equal to the straight lines A, B, and to ab, bf apply the
rectangles ag, bk equal to C, D respectively.
Then, as before, the rectangles ag, bk have the same height.
Now

A + B:B

=

af:bf

= rect. ak: rect. bk
= C +

D:D.

Thirdly, let all the magnitudes be straight lines.
Apply to the straight lines C, D rectangles P, Q having the same height.
