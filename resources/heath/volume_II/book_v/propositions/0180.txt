PROPOSITION 

19

If, as a whole is to a whole, so is a part subtracted to a
part subtracted, the remainder will also be to the remainder
as whole to whole.
For, as the whole AB is to the whole CD, so let the
part AE subtracted be to the part CF
subtracted;
I say that the remainder EB will also be
—-+
to the remainder FD as the whole AB to c r
o
the whole CD.
F o r since, as AB is to CD, so is AE
to CF,
alternately also, as BA is to AE, so is DC to CF.
[v. 16]
And, since the magnitudes are proportional componendo,
they will also be proportional separando,
[v. 17]
that is, as BE is to EA, so is DF to CF,
and, alternately,
as BE is to DF, so is EA to FC.
[v. 16]
But, as AE is to CF, so by hypothesis is the whole AB
to the whole CD.
Therefore also the remainder EB will be to the remainder
FD as the whole AB is to the whole CD.
[v. n ]
Therefore etc.

From this it is manifest that, if magnitudes be
componendo, they will also be proportional

converlendo.]
Q. E. D.

Algebraically, if a : b = c: d (where c < a and d < b), then

(a-c):(b-d)=a:b.
T h e " Porism " at the end of this proposition is led up to by a few lines
which Heiberg brackets because it is not Euclid's habit to explain a
Porism, and indeed a Porism, from its very nature, should not need any
