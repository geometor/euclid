Let there be three magnitudes A, B, C, and others
D, E, F equal to them in multitude, which taken two and
two are in the same ratio, so that,
as A is to B, so is D to E,
and
as B is to C, so is E to F;

and let A be greater than C ex aequali;
I say that D will also be greater than F; if A is equal to C,
equal; and, if less, less.

For, since A is greater than C,
and B is some other magnitude,
and the greater has to the same a greater ratio than the less
has,
[v. 8]
therefore A has to B a greater ratio than C has to B.
But, as A is to B, so is D to E,
and, as C is to B, inversely, so is F to E j
therefore D has also to E a. greater ratio than F has to E. [v. 13]
But, of magnitudes which have a ratio to the same, that
which has a greater ratio is greater;
[v. 10]
therefore D is greater than F
Similarly we can prove that, if A be equal to C, D will
also be equal to F; and if less, less.
Therefore etc.
Q. E. D.


Though, as already remarked, Euclid has not yet given us any definition
of compounded ratios, Props. 20—23 contain an important part of the theory
of such ratios. T h e term "compounded ratio" is not used, but the propositions
connect themselves with the definitions of ex aequali in its two forms, the
ordinary form defined in Def. 17 and that called perturbed proportion in
Def. 18. T h e compounded ratios dealt with in these propositions are those
compounded of successive ratios in which the consequent of one is the
antecedent of the next, or the antecedent of one is the consequent of
the next.
Prop. 22 states the fundamental proposition about the ratio ex aequali in
its ordinary form, to the effect that,
if
a is to b as d is to e,
and
b is to c as e is t o / ,
then
a is to c as d is to /
