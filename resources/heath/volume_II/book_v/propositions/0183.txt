with the extension to any number of such ratios; Prop. 23 gives the
corresponding theorem for the case of perturbed proportion, namely that,
if
a is to b as e is to / ,
and
b is to c as d is to e,
then
a is to c as d is to f.
Each depends on a preliminary proposition, Prop. 22 on Prop. 20 and
Prop. 23 on Prop. 21. T h e course of the proof will be made most clear by
using the algebraic notation.
The preliminary Prop. 20 asserts that,
if
a : b = d : e,
and
b:c = e:f,
then, according as « > = <<:, d> = <./.
For, according as a is greater than, equal to, or less than c,
the ratio a : b is greater than, equal to, or less than the ratio c: b, [v. 8 or v. 7]
or (since
d :e = a:b,
and
e:b=/:e)
the ratio d: e is greater than, equal to, or less than the ratio / : e,
[by aid of v. 13 and v. 1 1 ]
and therefore d is greater than, equal to, or less than /
[v. 10 or v. 9]
It is next proved in Prop. 22 that, by v. 4, the given proportions can be
transformed into
ma : nb = md: tie,
and
nb : pc = ne : pf,
whence, by v. 20,
according as ma is greater than, equal to, or less than pc,
md is greater than, equal to, or less than pf,
so that, by Def. 5,
a:c = d:f.
Prop. 23 depends on Prop. 21 in the same way as Prop. 22 on Prop. 20,
but the transformation of the ratios in Prop. 23 is to the following:
(1)
ma:mb = ne: tip
(by a double application of v. 15 and by v. n ) ,
(2)
mb : nc = md: ne
(by v. 4, or equivalent steps),
and Prop. 21 is then used.
Simson makes the proof of Prop. 20 slightly more explicit, but the main
difference from the text is in the addition of the two other cases which Euclid
dismisses with " Similarly we can prove." These cases are
" Secondly, let A be equal to C; then shall D be equal to F.
Because A and C are equal to one another,
A is to B as C is to B.
[v. 7]
But
A is to B as D is to E,
and
C is to B as F is to E,
wherefore
D is to E as Fto E;
[v. 1 1 ]
and therefore D is equal to F.
[v. 9]
