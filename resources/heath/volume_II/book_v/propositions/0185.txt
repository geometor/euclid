Similarly we can prove that,
if A be equal to C, D will also be equal to F;
and if less, less.
Therefore etc.
Algebraically, if

then, according as a > = <f, d •> = </.
Simson's alterations correspond to those which he makes in Prop. 20. After
the first case he proceeds thus.
"Secondly, let A be equal to C; then shall D be equal to F.
Because A and C are equal,
A is to B as C is to B.
\v. 7]
But
A is to B as E is to F,
and
C is to B as E is to D:
wherefore
E is to Fa& E to D,
[v. n ]
and therefore D is equal to F.
[v. 9]
Next, let A be less than C; then shall D be less than F.
For C is greater than A,
and, as was shown,'
C is to B as E to Z>,
and, in like manner,
B is to A as Fxo E;
therefore i^is greater than Z>, by the first case,
and therefore D is less than F."
The proof may be shown thus.
According as o > = < f , a :b> = <c:b.
But a :b = e :/, and, by inversion, c:b = e:d.
Therefore,according as a > = < f , e:/> = <e:d,
and therefore d > = </.

PROPOSITION 

22.

If there be any number of magnitudes whatever, and others
equal to them in multitude, which taken two and two together
are in the same ratio, they will also be in the same ratio ex
aequali.
Let there be any number of magnitudes A, B, C, and
others D, E, F equal to them in multitude, which taken two
and two together are in the same ratio, so that,
as A is to B, so is D to E,
and,
as B is to C, so is E to F;
I say that they will also be in the same ratio ex aequali,
< that is, as A is to C, so is D to F>.
