Then, since, as A is to B, so is D to E,
and of A, D equimultiples G, H have been taken,
and of B, E other, chance, equimultiples K, L,
therefore, as G is to K, so is H to L.
F o r the same reason also,
as K is to M, so is L to N.

[v. 4]

Since, then, there are three magnitudes G, K, M, and
others H, L, N equal to them in multitude, which taken two
and two together are in the same ratio,
therefore, ex aequali, if G is in excess of M, H is also in excess
of/V;
if equal, equal; and if less, less.
And G, H are equimultiples of A,

[v. 20]
D,

and M, N other, chance, equimultiples of C, F.
Therefore, as A is to C, so is D to F.
Therefore etc.

[v. Def. 5]
Q. E. D.

Euclid enunciates this proposition as true of any number of magnitudes
whatever forming two sets connected in the manner described, but his proof is
confined to the case where each set consists of three magnitudes only. The
extension to any number of magnitudes is, however, easy, as shown by
Simson.
"Next let there be four magnitudes A, B, C, D, and other four E, F, G, H,
which two and two have the same ratio, viz.:
as A is to B, so is E to F,
A B C D
and
as B is t o C, so is Fxo G,
E
F Q
H
and
as C is to D, so is G to If;
A shall be to D as E to H.
Because A, B, C are three magnitudes, and E, F, G other three, which
taken two and two have the same ratio,
by the foregoing case,
A is to C as E to G.
