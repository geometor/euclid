But C is to D as G is to H;
wherefore again, by the first case,

A is to D as E to H.
And so on, whatever be the number of magnitudes."

PROPOSITION 

23.

If there be three magnitudes, and others equal to them in
multitude, which taken two and two together are in the same
ratio, and the proportion of them be perturbed, they will also
be in the same ratio ex aequali.
Let there be three magnitudes A, B, C, and others equal
to them in multitude, which, taken two and two together, are
in the same proportion, namely D, E, F; and let the propor­
tion of them be perturbed, so that,
as A is to B, so is E to F,
and,
as B is to C, so is D to E;
I say that, as A is to C, so is D to F.

Of A, B, D let equimultiples G, H, K be taken,
and of C, E, F other, chance, equimultiples L, M, N.
Then, since G, H are equimultiples of A, B,
and parts have the same ratio as the same multiples of
them,
[v. 15]
therefore, as A is to B, so is G to H.
F o r the same reason also,
as E is to F, so is M to N.
And, as A is to B, so is £ to F;
therefore also, as G is to H, so is M to N.
[v. n ]
Next, since, as B is to C, so is D to E,
alternately, also, as B is to D, so is C to £.
[v. 16]
And, since H, K are equimultiples of B, D,
and parts have the same ratio as their equimultiples,
therefore, as B is to D, so is H to K.
