But, as B is to D, so is C to E;
therefore also, as H is to K, so is C to E.
[v. 11]
Again, since L, M are equimultiples of C, E,
therefore, as C is to E, so is L to M.
[v. 15]
But, as C is to E, so is H to A*;
therefore also, as TV is to K, so is L to J / ,
[v. 11]
and, alternately, as H is to L, so is K to
[v. 16]
But it was also proved that,
as 67 is to H, so is M to N.
Since, then, there are three magnitudes 67, H, L, and
others equal to them in multitude K, M, N, which taken two
and two together are in the same ratio,
and the proportion of them is perturbed,
therefore, ex aequali, if 67 is in excess of Z , K is also in excess

oiN;
if equal, equal; and if less, less.
And 67, K are equimultiples of A, D,
and Z , N of C, F.
Therefore, as A is to C, so is D to F.
Therefore etc.

Q. E. D.

There is an important difference between the version given by Simson of
one part of the proof of this proposition and that found in the Greek text of
Heiberg. Peyrard's MS. has the version given by Heiberg, but Simson's
version has the authority of other MSS. T h e Basel editio princeps gives both
versions (Simson's being the first). After it has been proved by means of
v. 15 and v. 11 that,
as G is to H, so is M to N,
or, with the notation used in the note on Prop. 20,
ma : mb = ne : nf,
it has to be proved further that,
as H is to Z, so is K to M,
or
mb :nc= md: ne,
and it is clear that the latter result may be directly inferred from v. 4. T h e
reading translated by Simson makes this inference :
" And because, as B is to C, so is D to E,
and H, K are equimultiples of B, D,
and Z , M of C, E,
therefore, as Zj*"is to Z , so is AT to M."
[v. 4]
T h e version in Heiberg's text is not only much longer (it adopts the
roundabout method of using each of three Propositions v. 1 1 , 15, 16 twice
