over), but it is open to the objection that it uses v. 16 which is only applicable
if the four magnitudes are of the same kind; whereas v. 23, the proposition
now in question, is not subject to this restriction.
Simson rightly observes that in the last step of the proof it should be
stated that " G, K are any equimultiples whatever of A, D, and Z , JV any
whatever of C, F."
H e also gives the extension of the proposition to any number of magnitudes,
enunciating it thus:
" If there be any number of magnitudes, and as many others, which, taken
two and two, in a cross order, have the same ratio; the first shall have to the
last of the first magnitudes the same ratio which the first of the others has to
the last";
and adding to the proof as follows:
"Next, let there be four magnitudes A, B, C, D, and other four £, F, G, H,
which, taken two and two in a cross order, have the same ratio, viz.:
A to B as G to ZZ,
A
B c
0
B to C as F to G,
E
F Q
H
and
C to D as E to F;
then A is to D as £ to H.
Because A, B, C are three magnitudes, and F, G, H other three which,
taken two and two in a cross order, have the same ratio,
by the first case,
A is to C as Fto ZZ.
But
C is to Z> as £ is to F;
wherefore again, by the first case,
A is to D as £ to ZZ.
And so on, whatever be the number of magnitudes."

PROPOSITION 

24.

If a first magnitude have to a second the same ratio as a
third has to a fourth, and also a fifth have to the second the
same ratio as a sixth to the fourth, the first and fifth added
together will have to the second the same ratio as the third and
sixth have to the fourth.
Let a first magnitude AB have to a second C the same
ratio as a third DE has to a
fourth F;
A
g
G
and let also a fifth BG have to
0
the second C the same ratio as
D
i
H
a sixth EH has to the fourth
F

F;
I say that the first and fifth added together, A G, will have
to the second C the same ratio as the third and sixth, DH,
has to the fourth F.
