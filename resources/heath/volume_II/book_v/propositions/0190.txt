F o r since, as BG is to C, so is EH to F,
inversely, as C is to BG, so is F to EH.
Since, then, as AB is to C, so is DE to F,
and, as C is to BG, so is Z to EH,

therefore, ex aequali, as AB is to Z?(7, so is DE to Z / / . [v. 22]
And, since the magnitudes are proportional separando, they
will also be proportional componendo ;
[v. 18]
therefore, as A G is to GB, so is DH to HE.
But also, as BG is to C, so is Z / / to F;

Q. E. D.

Algebraically, if
a:c = d:f,
and
b:c-e:f,
then
(a +
b):c=(d+e):f.
This proposition is of the same character as those which precede the
propositions relating to compounded ratios; but it could not be placed earlier
than it is because v. 22 is used in the proof of it.
Inverting the second proportion to
c: b =/: e,
it follows, by v. 22, that
a:b = d:e,
whence, by v. 18,
(a + b): b = (d + e) : e,
and from this and the second of the two given proportions we obtain, by a
fresh application of v. 22,
(a +
b):c=(d+e):f.
T h e first use of v. 22 is important as showing that the opposite process to
compounding ratios, or what we should now call division of one ratio by
another, does not require any new and separate propositions.
Aristotle tacitly uses v. 24 in combination with v. 11 and v. 16, Meteorologica
in. 5, 376 a 22—26.
Simson adds two corollaries, one of which (Cor. 2) notes the extension to
any number of magnitudes.
" T h e proposition holds true of two ranks of magnitudes whatever be their
number, of which each of the first rank has to the second magnitude the same
ratio that the corresponding one of the second rank has to a fourth magnitude;
as is manifest."
Simson's Cor. 1 states the corresponding proposition to the above with
separando taking the place of componendo, viz., that corresponding to the
algebraical form
(a-b):c=(d-e):f.
"COR. 1. I f the same hypothesis be made as in the proposition, the
excess of the first and fifth shall be to the second as the excess of the third
and sixth to the fourth. T h e demonstration of this is the same with that of
the proposition if division be used instead of composition." That is, we use
v. 17 instead of v. 18, and conclude that
{a-b) :b =
(d-e):e.
