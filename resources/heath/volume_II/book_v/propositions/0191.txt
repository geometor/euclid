PROPOSITION 

25,

// four magnitudes be proportional, the greatest and the
least are greater than the remaining two.
Let the four magnitudes AB, CD, E, F be
so that, as AB is to CD, so is E to
F, and let AB be the greatest of them
and F the least;
I say that AB, F are greater than

proportional

F o r let AG be made equal to E,
and CH equal to F.
Since, as AB is to CD, so is E
to F,
and E is equal to A G, and F to CH,
therefore, as AB is to CD, so is A G to CH.
And since, as the whole AB is to the whole CD, so is
the part AG subtracted to the part CH subtracted,
the remainder GB will also be to the remainder HD as
the whole AB is to the whole CD.
[v. 19]
But AB is greater than CD ;
therefore GB is also greater than HD.
And, since A G is equal to E, and CH to F,
therefore AG, Fare equal to CH, E.
And if, GB, HD being unequal, and GB greater, AG, F
be added to GB and CH, E be added to HD,
it follows that AB, F are greater than CD, E.
Therefore etc.

Algebraically, if

a

:b-c:d,

and a is the greatest of the four magnitudes and d the least,
a + d > b + c.
Simson is right in inserting a word in the setting-out, "let AB be the
greatest of them and < consequently > F the least." This follows from the
particular case, really included in Def. 5, which Simson makes the subject of
his proposition A, the case namely where the equimultiples taken are once the
several magnitudes.
The proof is as follows.
Since
a-c:b

a :b = c:d,
— d=a:b.
