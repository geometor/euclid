But a > b; therefore (a - c) > (b - d).
[v. 16 and 14]
Add to each (c + d);
therefore
(a + d)> (b + c).
There is an important particular case of this proposition, which is,
however, not mentioned here, viz. the case where b = c. T h e result shows, in
this case, that the arithmetic mean between two magnitudes is greater than
their geometric mean. T h e truth of this is proved for straight lines in vi.- 27
by " geometrical algebra," and the theorem forms the 8iopta/ios for equations
of the second degree.
Simson adds at the end of Book v. four propositions, F , G, H , K, which,
however, do not seem to be of sufficient practical use to justify their inclusion
here. But he adds at the end of his notes to the Book the following
paragraph which deserves quotation word for word.
" T h e 5th book being thus corrected, I most ie.idily agree to what the
learned Dr Barrow says, 'that there is nothing in the whole boiiy of the
elements of a more subtile invention, nothing more solidly established, and
more accurately handled than the doctrine of proportionals.' And there is
some ground to hope that geometers will think that this could not have been
said with as good reason, since Theon's time till the present."
Simson's claim herein will readily be admitted by all readers who are
competent to form a judgment upon his criticisms and elucidations of Book v.
