PROPOSITION 

I.

Triangles and parallelograms which are under the same
height are to one another as their bases.
Let ABC, A CD be triangles and EC, CF parallelograms
under the same height;
5 I say that, as the base BC is to the base CD, so is the
triangle ABC to the triangle A CD, and the parallelogram
EC to the parallelogram CF.

F o r let BD be produced in both directions to the points
H, L and let [any number of straight lines] BG, GH be
io made equal to the base BC, and any number of straight lines
DK, KL equal to the base CD;
let AG,

AH,

AK,

AL

be joined.

Then, since CB, BG, GH are equal to one another,
the triangles ABC,
is another.

AGB,

AHG

are also equal to one
[i. 38]

Therefore, whatever multiple the base HC is of the base
BC, that multiple also is the triangle AHC
of the triangle

ABC.
F o r the same reason,
20 whatever multiple the base LC is of the base CD, that
multiple also is the triangle ALC of the triangle ACD;
and, if the base HC is equal to the base CL, the triangle
AHC is also equal to the triangle ACL,
