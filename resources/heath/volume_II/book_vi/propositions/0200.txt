Then the rectangles ABCD, AIKD are in the ratio of the bases AB, A I,
since the latter are commensurable.
Therefore, inverting the proportion,
rect. AIKD : rect. ABCD = AI: AB
(2).
From this and (1), ex aequali,
rect. AIKD : rect. AEFD

=

AI:AO.

But A O > AI; therefore rect. AEFD > rect. AIKD.
But this is impossible, for the rectangle AEFD
is less than the rectangle
AIKD.
Similarly an impossibility can be proved if AO < AE.
Therefore
rect. ABCD : rect. AEFD * AB : AE.
Some modern American and German text-books adopt the less rigorous
method of appealing to the theory of limits.

PROPOSITION 

2.

If a straight line be drawn parallel to one of the sides of a
triangle, it will cut the sides of the triangle proportionally ;
and, if the sides of the triangle be cut proportionally, the line
joining the points of section will be parallel to the remaining
side of the triangle.
F o r let DE be drawn parallel to BC, one of the sides of
the triangle ABC;
I say that, as BD is to DA, so is CE to

EA.
F o r let BE, CD be joined.
Therefore the triangle BD E is equal to
the triangle CDE;
for they are on the same base DE and in
the same parallels DE, BC.
[1. 38]
And the triangle ADE

is another area.

But equals have the same ratio to the same;

[v. 7]

therefore, as the triangle BDE is to the triangle ADE, so
is the triangle CDE to the triangle
ADE.
But, as the triangle BDE is to ADE, so is BD to DA ;
for, being under the same height, the perpendicular drawn
from E to AB, they are to one another as their bases, [vi. 1]
F o r the same reason also,
as the triangle CDE

is to ADE,

so is CE to

Therefore also, as BD is to DA,

EA.

so is CE to EA.
