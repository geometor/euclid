remaining sides of the triangle, the straight line joined from
the vertex to the point of section will bisect the angle of the
triangle.
Let ABC be a triangle, and let the angle BA C be bisected
by the straight line AD ;
I say that, as BD is to CD, so
is BA to AC.
For let CE be drawn through
C parallel to DA, and let BA
be carried through and meet it
at E.
Then, since the straight line
A C falls upon the parallels AD,

the angle ACE

[1. 29]

But the angle ACE

was also proved equal to the angle

therefore the angle A CE is also equal to the angle
so that the side AE is also equal to the side AC.
