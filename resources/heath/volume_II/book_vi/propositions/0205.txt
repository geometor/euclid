the same form in Aristotle, Meteorologica in. 5, 376 a 3 sqq. T h e
analysis leading up to the construction is, as usual, not given either by
Aristotle or Eutocius. We are told to take three straight lines x, CO (a
length measured along BC produced beyond C, where B, C are the points at
which the greater and smaller of the inflected lines respectively terminate),
and r, such that, if A: k be the given ratio and h > k,

B

C

D

O

(E)

This determines the position of O, and the length of r, the radius of the
required circle. T h e circle is then drawn, any point P is taken on it and
joined to B, C respectively, and it is proved that
PB:

PC=h:k.

We may conjecture that the analysis proceeded somewhat as follows.
It would be seen that B, C are " conjugate points " with reference to the
circle on DE as diameter. (Cf. Apollonius, Conies, I. 36, where it is proved,
in terms, for a circle as well as for an ellipse and a hyperbola, that, if the
polar of B meets the diameter DE in C, then EC: CD = EB : BD.)
If O be the middle point of DE, and therefore the centre of the circle,
D, E may be eliminated, as in the Conies, 1. 37, thus.
Since

EC: CD = EB : BD,

it follows that EC + CD: EC-

CD = EB + BD :

or

20D.20C=20B-.2OD,

that is,

BO.OC=

EB~BD,

2

OD = r*, say.

If therefore P be any point on the circle with centre O and radius r,
BO:OP=OP:

OC,

so that BOP, POC are similar triangles.
In addition, h:k=BD:

DC= BE :.EC
= BD + BE : DE = BO : r.

Hence we require that
BO:r

= r:OC=BP:PC=h:k

(8)

Therefore, alternately,
k:CO

=

h:r,

which is the second relation in (/3) above.
Now assume a length x such that each of the last ratios is equal to x: BC,
as in (/}).
