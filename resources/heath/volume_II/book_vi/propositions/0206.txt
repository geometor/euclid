Then

x:BC

= k: CO = h:r.

Therefore

x + k: BO = h:r,

and, alternately,

x + k: h - BO: r
= h:k,

from (8) above;

and this is the relation (a) which remained to be found.
Apollonius' proof of the construction is given by Eutocius, who begins by
saying that it is manifest that r is a mean proportional between BO and OC.
This is seen as follows .
From (/?) we derive
x:BC=k:

CO = A:r = (k + x):

whence

BO :r=(A

+

= h:k,

by (a),

= r:CO,

by (,8),

and therefore

x):A

r = BO.

CO.

But the triangles BOP, POC have the angle at 0 common, and, since
BO: OP = OP: OC, the triangles are similar and the angles OPC,
OBP
are equal.
[Up to this point Aristotle's proof is exactly the same; from this point it
diverges slightly.]
If now CL be drawn parallel to BP meeting OP in L, the angles BPC
L CP are equal also.
Therefore the triangles BPC, PCL are similar, and
BP:PC=PC:CL,
whence

PC =

Therefore

Since these triangles are similar,

Apollonius proves lastly, by reductio ad absurdunt, that the last equation
cannot be true with reference to any point P which is not on the circle so
described.

PROPOSITION 

4.

In equiangular triangles the sides about the equal angles
are proportional, and those are corresponding sides which
subtend the equal angles.
