Let ABC, DCE be equiangular triangles having the
angle ABC equal to the angle
DCE, the angle BAC
to the
angle CDE, and further the angle
ACS to the angle CED ;
I say that in the triangles ABC,
DCE the sides about the equal
angles are proportional, and those
are corresponding sides which
subtend the equal angles.
F o r let BC be placed in a
straight line with CE.
Then, since the angles ABC, ACB
angles,

are less than two right
[1. 1 7 ]

and the angle A CB is equal to the angle DEC,
therefore the angles ABC, DEC are less than two right
angles;
therefore BA, ED, when produced, will meet.
[1. Post. 5 ]
Let them be produced and meet at E.
Now, since the angle DCE

is equal to the angle

BE is parallel to CD.
Again, since the angle ACB

is equal to the angle

AC is parallel to EE.

ABC,
[1. 2 8 ]
DEC,
[1. 2 8 ]

Therefore FA CD is a parallelogram ;
therefore FA

is equal to DC, and AC to FD.

[1. 3 4 ]

And, since AC has been drawn parallel to EE, one side
of the triangle FBE,
therefore, as BA is to AF, so is BC to CE.
[vi. 2 ]
But AF is equal to CD;
therefore, as BA is to CD, so is BC to CE,
and alternately, as AB is to BC, so is DC to CE.

[v. 1 6 ]

Again, since CD is parallel to BE,
therefore, as BC is to CE, so is FD to DE.

[vi. 2 ]

But FD is equal to AC;
therefore, as BC is to CE, so is A C to DE,
and alternately, as BC is to CA, so is CE to ED.
