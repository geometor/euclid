Since then it was proved that,
as AB is to BC, so is DC to CE,
and,.,
as BC is to CA, so is CE to ED;

therefore, ex aequali, as i L 4 is to AC, so is CD to

Q. E. D.

Todhunter remarks that " the manner in which the two triangles are to be
placed is very imperfectly described; their bases are to be in the same straight
line and contiguous, their vertices are to be on the same side of the base, and
each of the two angles which have a common vertex is to be equal to the
remote angle o f the other triangle." But surely Euclid's description is
sufficient, except for not saying that B and D must be on the same side
of
BCE.
vi. 4 can be immediately deduced from vi. 2 if we superpose one triangle
on the other three times in succession, so that each angle successively
coincides with its equal, the triangles being similarly situated, e.g. if (A, B, C
and D, E, F being the equal angles respectively) we apply the angle DEE to
the angle ABC so that D lies on AB (produced if necessary) and Fori
BC
(produced if necessary). Be Morgan prefers this method. " Abandon," he
says, " the peculiar mode of construction by which Euclid proves two cases at
o n c e ; make an angle coincide with its equal, and suppose this process repeated
three times, one for each angle."

If two triangles have their sides proportional, the triangles

Let ABC, DEE be two triangles having their sides
proportional, so that,
as AB is to BC, so is DE to EE,
as BC is to CA, so is EE to FD,
and further, as BA is to AC, so is ED to DE;
I say that the triangle ABC is equiangular with the triangle
DEE, and they will have those angles equal which the corre­
sponding sides subtend, namely the angle ABC to the angle
DEE, the angle BCA to the angle EED, and further the
angle BAC to the angle EDF.
For on the straight line EE, and at the points E, E on
it, let there be constructed the angle EEG equal to the angle
ABC, and the angle EEG equal to the angle ACB;
