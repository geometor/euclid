therefore the remaining angle at A is equal to the remaining
angle at G.

Therefore the triangle ABC

is equiangular with the

Therefore in the triangles ABC, GEF the sides about
the equal angles are proportional, and those are corresponding
sides which subtend the equal angles ;

therefore, as AB
But, as AB

is to BC, so is GE to EE.

to

EE;

therefore, as DE is to EE, so is GE to EF.

[v. n ]

Therefore each of the straight lines DE,
same ratio to EE;

GE has the

therefore DE is equal to GE.

[v. 9 ]

F o r the same reason
DE is also equal to GE.
Since then DE

is equal to EG,

and EF is common,
the two sides DE, EF are equal to the two sides GE,

EF;

and the base DE is equal to the base EG ;
therefore the angle DEE
and the triangle DEE

is equal to the angle GEF,

is equal to the triangle

GEF,

and the remaining angles are equal to the remaining angles,
namely those which the equal sides subtend.

Therefore the angle DEE

And, since the angle FED
