in this case the sides of the triangles are proportional, but not in the same
order, and the triangles are not necessarily equiangular to one another. For a
numerical illustration we may suppose the sides of one triangle to be 3 , 4 and
5 feet respectively, and those of another to be 1 2 , 1 5 and 2 0 feet respectively.

PROPOSITION

6.

If two triangles have one angle equal to one angle and the
sides about the equal angles proportional, the triangles will be
equiangular and will have those angles equal which the corre­
sponding sides subtend.
Let ABC, DEF be two triangles having one angle BAC
equal to one angle EDF and the sides about the equal angles
proportional, so that,
as BA is to AC, so is ED to DE;
I say that the triangle ABC is equiangular with the triangle
DEF, and will have the angle ABC equal to the angle DEF,
and the angle A CB to the angle DFE.
F o r on the straight line DE, and at the points D, F on it,
let there be constructed the angle FDG equal to either of the
angles BA C, EDF, and the angle DFG equal to the angle
ACB;

[1.23]

therefore the remaining angle at . 5 is equal to the remaining
angle at G.
