[v. n ]

Therefore ED is equal to DG;

[v. 9 ]

and DF is common ;
therefore the two sides ED, DFare equal to the two sides
GD, DF; and the angle EDF is equal to the angle GDF;
therefore the base EF is equal to the base GE,
and the triangle DEF

is equal to the triangle

DGF,

and the remaining angles will be equal to the remaining angles,
namely those which the equal sides subtend.
[1. 4 ]
Therefore the angle DFG

is equal to the angle

to the angle

But the angle DFG

therefore the remaining angle at B is also equal to the

therefore the triangle ABC

Therefore etc.
