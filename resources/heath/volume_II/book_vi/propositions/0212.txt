If two triangles have one angle equal to one angle, the
sides about other angles proportional, and the remaining angles
either both less or both not less than a right angle, the triangles
will be equiangular and will have those angles equal, the sides
about which are proportional.
Let ABC, DEF be. two triangles having one angle equal
to one angle, the angle BAC to
the angle EDF, the sides about
other angles ABC, DEF propor­
tional, so that, as AB is to BC,
so is DE to EF, and, first, each
of the remaining angles at C, F
less than a right angle ;
I say that the triangle ABC
is
equiangular with the triangle
DEF,
the angle ABC
will be
equal to the angle DEF, and the remaining angle, namely
the angle at C, equal to the remaining angle, the angle
at F.
For, if the angle ABC is unequal to the angle DEF,
of them is greater.
Let the angle ABC be greater ;

one

and on the straight line AB, and at the point B on it, let the
angle ABG be constructed equal to the angle DEF.
[1. 2 3 ]
Then, since the angle A is -equal to D,
and the angle ABG

to the angle

DEF,

therefore the remaining angle A GB is equal to the remaining
angle DFE.
[1. 3 2 ]
Therefore the triangle ABG
is equiangular with the
triangle DEF.
Therefore, as AB is to BG, so is DE to EF
[vi. 4 ]
But, as DE is to EF, so by hypothesis is AB to BC;
therefore AB has the same ratio to each of the straight
lines BC, BG;
[v. n ]
therefore BC is equal to BG,
so that the angle at C is also equal to the angle BGC.
