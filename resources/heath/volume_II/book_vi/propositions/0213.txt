But, by hypothesis, the angle at C is less than a right
angle;
therefore the angle BGC is also less than a right angle;
so that the angle AGB adjacent to it is greater than a right
angle.
[1. 1 3 ]
And it was proved equal to the angle at F;
therefore the angle at F is also greater than a right angle.
But it is by hypothesis less than a right angle : which is
absurd.
Therefore the angle ABC is not unequal to the angle

DEF;
therefore it is equal to it.
But the angle at A is also equal to the angle at D ;
therefore the remaining angle at C is equal to the remaining
angle at F.
[1. 3 2 ]
Therefore the triangle ABC

is equiangularwith the triangle

DEF.
But, again, let each of the angles at C, F be supposed not
less than a right angle;
I say again that, in this case too, the
triangle ABC is equiangular with the
triangle DEF.
For, with the same construction,
we can prove similarly that
BC is equal to BG ;
so that the angle at C is also equal to
the angle BGC.
[1. 5 ]
But the angle at C is not less than a right angle;
therefore neither is the angle BGC less than a right angle.
Thus in the triangle BGC the two angles are not less
than two right angles : which is impossible.
[1. 1 7 ]
Therefore, once more, the angle ABC is not unequal to
the angle DEF;
therefore it is equal to it.
But the angle at A is also equal to the angle at D;
therefore the remaining angle at C is equal to the remaining
angle at F.
