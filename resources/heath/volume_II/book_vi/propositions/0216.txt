For, since the angle BAC is equal to the angle
for each is right,
and the angle at B is common to the
two triangles ABC and ABD,
therefore the remaining angle ACB
is equal to the remaining angle
BAD;

ADB,

[..32]

therefore the triangle ABC is equi­
angular with the triangle ABD.
Therefore, as BC which subtends the right angle in the
triangle ABC is to BA which subtends the right angle in
the triangle ABD, so is AB itself which subtends the angle
at C in the triangle ABC to BD which subtends the equal
angle BAD in the triangle ABD, and so also is AC to AD
which subtends the angle at B common to the two triangles.
[vi- 4 ]

Therefore the triangle ABC is both equiangular to the
triangle ABD
and has the sides about the equal angles
proportional.
Therefore the triangle ABC is similar to the triangle

ABD.

[vi. Def. 1]

Similarly we can prove that
the triangle ABC is also similar to the triangle ADC;
therefore each of the triangles ABD, ADC is similar to the
whole ABC.
I say next that the triangles ABD, ADC are also similar
to one another.
For, since the right angle BDA is equal to the right angle

ADC,
and moreover the angle BAD was also proved equal to the
angle at C,
therefore the remaining angle at B is also equal to the
remaining angle DAC;
[r. 3 a ]
therefore the triangle ABD

is equiangular with the triangle

ADC.
Therefore, as BD which subtends the angle BAD in the
triangle ABD is to DA which subtends the angle at C in the
triangle ADC equal to the angle BAD,
so is AD itself
which subtends the angle at B in the triangle ABD to DC
which subtends the angle DAC in the triangle ADC equal
