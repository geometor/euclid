Because ED is parallel to one o f the sides of the triangle ABC,
as CD is to DA,
and,

so is BE

viz. to BC,

to EA,

[vi. 2 ]

eomponendo,
CA

is to AD,

But CA is a multiple of

as BA

to AE.

[v. 1 8 ]

AD;

therefore BA is the same multiple of AE.

[Prop. D ]

Whatever part therefore AD is of AC, AE is the same part o f

AB;

wherefore from the straight line AB the part required is cut off."
T h e use of Simson's Prop. D can be avoided, as noted by Camerer after
Baermann, in the following way.

We first prove, as above, that

CA is to AD

as BA

is to

as AD

to AE.

AE.

Then we infer that, alternately,
CA is to BA

But AD is to AE as n. AD

to n.

[v. 1 6 ]

AE

(where n is the number o f times that AD is contained in AC);

[v. 1 5 ]

whence AC is to AB as n . AD

[v. 1 1 ]

is to n. AE.

In this proportion the first term is equal to the third; therefore [v. 1 4 ]
the second is equal to the fourth,
so that AB is equal to n times

AE.

Prop. 9 is of course only a particular case of Prop. 1 0 .

PROPOSITION 

1 0 .

To cut a given uncut straight line similarly to a given cut
straight line.
Let AB be the given uncut straight line, and AC the
straight line cut at the points D,
E; and let them be so placed as
to contain any angle ;
let CB be joined, and through D,
E let DF, EG be drawn parallel
H
to BC, and through D let DHK
be drawn parallel to AB.

Therefore each of the figures
FH, HB is a parallelogram ;
therefore DH is equal to EG and HK to GB.

Now, since the straight line HE has been drawn parallel
to KC, one of the sides of the triangle DKC,
therefore, proportionally, as CE is to ED, so is KH to HD.
