But KH is equal to BG, and HD to GF;
therefore, as CE is to ED, so is BG to GF.
Again, since FD has been drawn parallel to GE, one ot
the sides of the triangle A GE,
therefore, proportionally, as ED is to DA, so is GF to FA.
[vi. 2 ]

But it was also proved that,
as CE is to ED, so is BG to GF;
therefore, as CE is to ED, so is BG to GF,
and, as iTZ? is to DA, so is GF to /vS?.
Therefore the given uncut straight line AB has been cut
similarly to the given cut straight line AC.
Q. E. D.


PROPOSITION 

1 1 .

To two given straight lines to find a third proportional.
Let BA, AC be the two given straight lines, and let
them be placed so as to contain any
angle;
thus it is required to find a third pro­
portional to BA, AC.
F o r let them be produced to the
points D, £, and let BD be made equal

X.0AC;

[1.3]

let BC be joined, and through D let DE
be drawn parallel to it.
[1. 3 1 ]
Since, then, BC has been drawn
parallel to DE, one of the sides of the triangle ADE,
proportionally, as AB is to BD, so is A C to CE.

[vi. 2 ]

But BD is equal to AC;
therefore, as AB is to AC, so is AC tc CE.
Therefore to two given straight lines AB,
proportional to them, CE, has been found.

AC a. third
Q. E. D.


1. t o find. T h e Greek word, here and in the next two propositions, is rpootvpttv,
literally " t o find in addition."
T h i s proposition is again a particular case o f the succeeding Prop. 1 2 .
Given a ratio between straight lines, vi, 11 enables us to find the ratio
which is its duplicate.
