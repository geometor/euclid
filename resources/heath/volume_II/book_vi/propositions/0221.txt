PROPOSITION 

1 2 .

To three given straight lines to find a fourth proportional.
Let A, B, C be the three given straight lines ;
thus it is required to find a fourth proportional to A, B, C.

Let two straight lines DE, DF be set out containing any
angle EDF;
let DG be made equal to A, GE equal to B, and further DH
equal to C;
let GH be joined, and let EF be drawn through E parallel
to i t
[1. 3 1 ]
Since, then, GH has been drawn parallel to EF, one of
the sides of the triangle DEF,
therefore, as DG is to GE, so is DH to HE.
[vi. 2 ]
But DG is equal to A, GE to B, and DH to C;
therefore, as A is to B, so is C to HE.
Therefore to the three given straight lines A, B, C a fourth
proportional HE has been found.
Q. E. D.

We have here the geometrical equivalent o f the " rule o f three."
It is o f course immaterial whether, as in Euclid's proof, the first and
second straight lines are measured on one of the lines forming the angle and
the third on the other, or the first and third are measured on one and the
second on the other.
I f it should be desired that the first and the required fourth be measured
on one o f the lines, and the second and third on
the other, we can use the following construction.
Measure DE on one straight line equal to A, and
on any other straight line making an angle with
the first at the point D measure DF equal to B,
and DG equal to C. Join EF, and through G
draw GH anti-parallel
to EF, Le. make the angle
DGH
equal to the angle DEF;
let GH meet
DE
(produced if necessary) in H.
