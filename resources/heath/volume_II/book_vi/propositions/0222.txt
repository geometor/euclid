For the triangles EDF, GDH are similar, and the sides about the equal
angles are proportional, so that
DE is to DFzs.

To two given straight lines to find a mean proportional.
Let AB, BC be the two given straight lines;
thus it is required to find a mean
proportional to AB,
BC.
Let them be placed in a straight
line, and let the semicircle ADC
be
described on AC;
let BD be drawn from the point B at
right angles to the straight line AC,
and let AD, DC be joined.
Since the angle ADC is an angle in a semicircle, it is
right.
[in. 3 1 ]
And, since, in the right-angled triangle ADC, DB has
been drawn from the right angle perpendicular to the base,
therefore DB is a mean proportional between the segments of
the base, AB, BC.
[vi. 8, Por.]
Therefore to the two given straight lines AB,
proportional DB has been found.

BC a mean

T h i s proposition, the B o o k vi. version o f 11. 1 4 , is equivalent to the
extraction o f the square root. It further enables us, given a ratio between
straight lines, to find the ratio which is its sub-duplicate,
or the ratio of which
it is duplicate.

In equal and equiangular parallelograms the sides about
the equal angles are reciprocally proportional; and equiangular
parallelograms in which the sides about the equal angles are
reciprocally proportional are equal.
