Let AB, BC be equal and equiangular parallelograms
having the angles at B equal, and
let DB, BE be placed in a straight
line;
therefore FB, BG are also in
a straight line.
[1. 1 4 ]
I say that, in AB, BC, the
sides about the equal angles are
reciprocally proportional, that is to
say, that, as DB is to BE, so is
GB to BE.
For let the parallelogram EE be completed.
Since, then, the parallelogram AB is equal to the parallelo­
gram BC,
and EE is another area,
therefore, as AB is to EE, so is BC to EE.
[v. 7 ]
But, as AB is to EE, so is DB to BE,
[vi. 1 ]
and, as BC is to EE, so is GB to BE.
[id.]
therefore also, as DB is to BE, so is GB to BE.
[v. 1 1 ]
Therefore in the parallelograms AB, BC the sides about
the equal angles are reciprocally proportional.
Next, let GB be to BE as DB to BE;
I say that the parallelogram AB is equal to the parallelogram

BC.
For since, as DB is to BE, so is 6 \ 5 to BE,
while, as DB is to BE, so is the parallelogram AB
parallelogram
and, as GB is to />V , so is the parallelogram BC
parallelogram EE,
therefore also, as
is to EE, so is BC to /^if;
r

therefore the parallelogram AB

to the
[vi. 1 ]
to the
[vi. 1 ]
[v. 1 1 ]

is equal to the parallelogram

BC.

Q. E. D.

De Morgan says upon this proposition : " Owing to the disjointed manner
in which Euclid treats compound ratio, this proposition is strangely out o f
place. It is a particular case o f vi. 2 3 , being that in which the ratio of the
sides, compounded, gives a ratio o f equality. T h e proper definition o f four
magnitudes being reciprocally proportional is that the ratio compounded o f
their ratios is that o f equality."
