triangles, such that the sides about the angles at B are reciprocally propor­
tional, i.e. such that

= GB

: BE.

We shall prove that the angles FBD, EBG are either equal or supple­
mentary.
Place the figures so that DB. BE are in one straight line.
Then FB, BG are either in a straight line, or not in a straight line.
( 1 ) I f FB, BG are in a straight line, the figure of the proposition
(with the diagonals FD, EG drawn) represents the facts, and
the angle FBD is equal to the angle EBG.

Now, since

: BF,

and therefore, by vi. 1 4 or 1 5 ,
the parallelograms AB, BKare

equal, or the triangles FBD,

EBH

are equal.

But the parallelograms AB, BC are equal, and the triangles FBD,
are equal;

EBG

therefore the parallelograms BC,
EBG
are equal.

EBH,

BK

are equal, and the triangles

Therefore these parallelograms or triangles are within the same parallels :
that is, G, C, H, K are in a straight line which is parallel to DE.
[1. 3 9 ]
Now, since BG, BH axe equal,
the angles BGH,

BHG

are equal.

By parallels, it follows that
the angle EBG
whence the angle EBG

is equa' to the angle

DBH,

is supplementary to the angle

FBD.

PROPOSITION

J5.

In eqital triangles which have one angle equal to one angle
the sides about the equal angles are reciprocally proportional;
and those triangles which have one angle equal to one angle,
and in which the sides about the equal angles are reciprocally
proportional, are equal.
Let ABC, ADE be equal triangles having one angle
equal to one angle, namely the angle BAC to the angle

DAE;
I say that in the triangles ABC, ADE the sides about the
equal angles are reciprocally proportional, that is to say, that,
as CA is to AD, so is EA to AB.
