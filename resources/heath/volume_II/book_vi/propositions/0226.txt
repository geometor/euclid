[vi. is

F o r let them be placed so that CA

therefore EA

is also in a straight line with

AB.

[i. 1 4 ]

Let BD be joined.
Since then the triangle ABC
the triangle ADE,

area,

is equal to
is another

therefore, as the triangle CAB is to the
triangle BAD, so is the triangle EAD
to
the triangle BAD.
[v. 7 ]
But, as CAB is to BAD, so is CA to AD,

[vi. 1 ]

and, as EAD is to BAD, so is EA to AB.

[id.]

Therefore also, as CA is to AD, so is EA to AB.
[v. 1 1 ]
Therefore in the triangles ABC, ADE
the sides about
the equal angles are reciprocally proportional.
Next, let the sides of the triangles ABC, ADE
be reci­
procally proportional, that is to say, let EA be to AB as CA
to AD;
I say that the triangle ABC is equal to the triangle
For, if BD be again joined,
to

ADE.

since, as CA is to AD,

so is EA

while, as CA is to AD,

so is the triangle ABC

AB,
to the triangle

so is the triangle EAD

to the triangle

BAD,
and, as EA

is to AB,

BAD,

"

[vi. 1 ]

therefore, as the triangle ABC is to the triangle BAD,
the triangle EAD to the triangle BAD.

so is
[v. n ]

Therefore each of the triangles ABC, EAD has the same
ratio to BAD.
Therefore the triangle ABC is equal to the triangle EAD.

Therefore etc.
Q. E. D.

As indicated in the partial converse given in the last note, this proposition
is equally true if the angle included by the two sides in one triangle if
supplementary, instead o f being equal, to the angle included by the two sides
in the other.
