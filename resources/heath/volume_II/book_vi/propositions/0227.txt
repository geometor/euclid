Let ABC, ADE be two triangles such that the angles BA C, DAE
supplementary, and also
CA

: AD

= EA

:

are

AB.

In this case we can place the triangles so that
CA is in a straight line with AD, and AB lies
along AE (since the angle EAC, being supple­
mentary to the angle EAD, is equal to the angle
I f we join BD, the proof given by Euclid
applies to this case also.
I t is true that vi. 1 5 can be immediately inferred from vi. 1 4 , since a
triangle is half o f a parallelogram with the same base and height.
But,
Euclid's object being to give the student a grasp o f methods rather than
results, there seems to be no advantage in deducing one proposition from the
other instead of using the same method on each.

PROPOSITION

16.

If four straight lines be proportional, the rectangle con­
tained by the extremes is equal to the rectangle contained by
the means; and, if the rectangle contained by the extremes be
equal to the rectangle contained by tfie means, the four straight
lines will be proportional.
Let the four straight lines AB, CD, E, F be proportional,
so that, as AB is to CD, so is E to F;
I say that the rectangle contained by AB, F is equal to the
rectangle contained by CD, E.

Let AG, CH be drawn from the points A, C at right
angles to the straight lines AB, CD, and let AG be made
equal to F, and CH equal to E.
Let the parallelograms BG, DH be completed.
Then since, as AB is to CD, so is E to F,
while E is equal to CH, and & to AG,
therefore, as AB is to CD, so is CH to AG.
Therefore in the parallelograms BG, DH the sides about
the equal angles are reciprocally proportional.
