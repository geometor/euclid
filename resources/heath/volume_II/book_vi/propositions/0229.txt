AD meeting B C {produced
if necessary)
in D and A E meeting the circle again
in E , such that the angles D A B , E A C are equal, then the rectangle A D , A E is
equal to the rectangle B A , AC.

J o i n CE.
T h e angles BAD,

EAC

art equal, by hypothesis;

and the angles ABD,

AEC

are equal.

Therefore the triangles ABD,
Hence

AEC

[m. 2

]

are equiangular.

BA is to AD as EA is to AC,

and therefore the rectangle BA, AC is equal to the rectangle AD,

AE.
[vi. 1 6 ]

There are now two particular cases to b e considered.
(a)
Suppose that AD, AE c o i n c i d e ;
ADE

will then bisect the angle

{b) Suppose that AD,
opposite sides o f A ;
AD

BAC.

AE are in one straight line but that D, E are on

will then bisect the external angle at A.
E

I n the first case {a) we have
the rectangle BA, A C equal to the rectangle EA,
and the rectangle EA, AD is equal to the rectangle ED,
the square on AD,

AD;

DA together with
[11. 3 ]

i.e. to the rectangle BD, DC together with the square on AD.
Therefore the rectangle BA,
together with the square on AD.
ED,

AC

[m. 3 5 ]

is equal to the rectangle BD,
DC
[This is Simson's Prop. B ]

In case {b) the rectangle EA, AD is equal to the excess o f the rectangle
DA over the square on AD;

therefore the rectangle BA, AC is equal to the excess o f the rectangle
DC over the square on AD.

BD,
