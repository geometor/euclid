T h e following converse o f Simson's Prop. B may be given: If a straight
line A D be drawn from the vertex A of a triangle to meet the base, so that the
square on A D together with the rectangle B D , D C is equal to the rectangle B A ,
A C , the line A D will bisect the angle B A C except when the sides A B , A C are
equal, in which case every line drawn
to the base will have the property
men­
tioned.
Let the circumscribed circle be drawn, and let AD produced meet it in
join CE.
T h e rectangle BD, DC is equal to the rectangle ED, DA.
[m. 3 5 ]
Add to each the square on AD;
therefore the rectangle BA, AC is equal to the rectangle EA, AD.
[hyp. and 11. 3 ]
E;

Hence

AB is to AD as AE to AC.

[vi. 1 6 ]

But the angle ABD is equal to the angle AEC.
[ill. 2 1 ]
Therefore the angles BDA, EC A are either equal or supplementary.
[vi. 7 and note]
(a)
I f they are equal, the angles BAD,
EAC
are also equal, and AD bisects the angle BAC.
(b)
I f they are supplementary, the angle ADC
must be equal to the angle A CE.
Therefore the angles BAD, ABD are together
equal to the angles ACB, BCE, i.e. to the angles
ACD,
BAD.
T a k e away the common angle BAD, and
the angles ABD,

ACD

are equal, or

AB is equal to AC.
Euclid himself assumes, in Prop. 6 7 of the Data, the result o f so much of
this proposition as relates to the case where BA = AC.
H e assumes namely,
without proof, that, if BA = AC, and if D be any point on BC, the rectangle
BD, DC together with the square on AD is equal to the square on AB.
*PROPOSITION 

C .
If from any angle of a triangle a straight line be drawn perpendicular
to the
opposite side, the rectangle contained by the other two sides of the triangle is equal
to the rectangle contained by the perpendicular
and the diameter of the circle
circumscribed
about the
triangle.
Let ABC be a triangle and AD the perpendicular on AB.
diameter AE o f the circle circumscribed about the triangle ABC.

T h e n shall the rectangle BA, A C be equal to the rectangle EA,
Join EC.

Draw the

AD.
