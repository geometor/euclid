Therefore,
as BA is to AD, so is EA to AC,
whence the rectangle BA, A C is equal to the rectangle EA, AD.

This is the highly important lemma given by Ptolemy (ed. Heiberg, Vol. 1,
pp. 3 6 — 7 ) which is the basis o f his calculation of the table of chords in the
section of Book 1. of the iityaK-q o-iWa|is entitled " concerning the size o f the
straight lines [i.e. chords] in the circle " (irepi TIJS 7TT;\KCOTT;TO5 r&v iy T<3 KVKAUI
tiBfiuv).
T h e theorem may be enunciated thus.
The rectangle contained by the diagonals of any quadrilateral
inscribed in a
circle is equal to the sum of the rectangles contained by the pairs of opposite sides.
I shall give the proof in Ptolemy's words, with the addition only, in
brackets, of two words applying to a second figure not given by Ptolemy.
" Let there be a circle with any quadrilateral ABCD
inscribed in it, and
let AC, BD be joined.
It is to be proved that the rectangle contained by A C and BD is equal
to the sum o f the rectangles AB, DC and AD, BC.
For let the angle ABE be made equal to the angle contained by DB, BC.

I f then we add [or subtract] the angle EBD,
the angle ABD will also be equal to the angle EBC.
But the angle BDA is also equal to the angle BCE,
for they subtend the same segment;
therefore the triangle ABD

is equiangular with the triangle

[111. 2 1 ]
EBC.

Hence, proportionally,
as BC is to CE, so is BD to DA.
Therefore the rectangle BC, AD is equal to the rectangle BD,
Again, since the angle ABE is equal to the angle DB C,
and the angle BAE is also equal to the angle BDC,
the triangle ABE is equiangular with the triangle DBC.
