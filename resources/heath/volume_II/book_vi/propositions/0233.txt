XY, YZ, so that the rectangle d, XZ is equal to the sum o f the rectangles
d, XY&nd
d, YZ, it follows that
AB,

the rectangle AC, BD is equal to the sum of the rectangles AD, BC and
CD.

Conversely,
if the latter statement is true, while we are supposed to know
nothing about the position o f D, it follows that
XZ must be equal to the sum o f XY,

YZ,

so that X, Y, Z must be in a straight line.
Hence, from the theorem ( 2 ) above, it follows that D must lie on the
circle circumscribed about ABC, i.e. that ABCD
is a quadrilateral about
which a circle can be described.
All the above propositions can be proved on the basis of Book 111. and
without using Book vi., since it is possible by the aid o f u i . , 2 1 and 3 5 alone
to prove that in equiangular
triangles
the rectangles
contained
by the noncorresponding
sides about equal angles are equal to one another (a result arrived
at by combining VI, 4 and vi. 1 6 ) . T h i s is the method adopted by Casey,
H. M. Taylor, and L a c h l a n ; but I fail to see any particular advantage in it.
Lastly, the following proposition may be given which Playfair added as
vi. E . It appears in the Data of Euclid, Prop. 9 3 , and may b e thus
enunciated.
If the angle B A C of a triangle
A B C be bisected by the straight line A D
meeting the circle circumscribed
about the triangle in D, and if BD be joined,
then
the sum of BA, AC is to A D as B C is to B D .
Join CD.
Then, since AD bisects the angle BAC,
BD,
DC, and therefore the chords BD, DC, are
equal.

the subtended arcs

( 1 ) T h e result can now be easily deduced from
Ptolemy's theorem.
For the rectangle AD, BCis
equal to the sum of
the rectangles AB, DC and AC, BD, i.e. (since
BD,
CD are equal) to the rectangle contained by
BA + AC and BD.
Therefore the sum of BA, AC is to AD as BC
is to BD.
[vi. 1 6 ]
( 2 ) Euclid proves it differently in Data, Prop. 9 3 .
Let AD meet BC in E.
Then, since AE bisects the angle BAC,
BA

is to AC as BE to EC,

[vi. 3 ]

AB

is to BE as A C to CE.

[v. 1 6 ]

or, alternately,
Therefore also
BA

+ AC\s

Again, since the angles BAD,
are also equal,
the triangles ABD,
Therefore

to BC as AC to CE.

[v. 1 2 ]

EA C are equal, and the angles ADB, A CE
[m. 2 1 ]

AEC axe equiangular.
A C is to CE as AD to BD.
