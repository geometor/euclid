Hence

BA + A C is to BC as AD to BD,

[v. 1 1 ]

and, alternately,
+ AC is to
as BC is to A O .
[v. 1 6 ]
Euclid concludes that, if the circle ABC is given in magnitude, and the
chord BC cuts off a segment of it containing a given angle (so that, by Data
Prop. 8 7 , BC and also BD are given in magnitude),

the ratio o f BA + AC to AD is given,
and further that (since, by similar triangles, BD is to DE as A C is to CE,
while A * + A C is to - 5 C as A C is to CE),
the rectangle ( A < + AC), DE, being equal to the rectangle BC, BD, is
also given.

//" three straight lines be proportional, the rectangle con­
tained by the extremes is equal to the square on the mean;
and, if the rectangle contained by the extremes be equal to the
square on the mean, the three straight lines will be proportional.
Let the three straight lines A, B, C be proportional, so
that, as A is to B, so is B to C ;
I say that the rectangle contained by A, C is equal to the
square on B.

Let D be made equal to B.
Then, since, as A is to B, so is B to C,
and B is equal to D,
therefore, as A is to B, so is D to C.
But, if four straight lines be proportional, the rectangle
contained by the extremes is equal to the rectangle contained
by the means.
[vi. 16
Therefore the rectangle A, C is equal to the rectangle

B, D.
But the rectangle B, D is the square on B, for B k
equal to D;
therefore the rectangle contained by A, C is equal to the
square on B.
Next, let the rectangle A, C be equal to tne square on B
I say that, as A is to B, so is B to C.
