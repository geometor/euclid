For, with the same construction,
since the rectangle A, C is equal to the square on B,
while the square on B is the rectangle B, D, for B is equal

toD,
therefore the rectangle A, C is equal to the rectangle B, D.
But, if the rectangle contained by the extremes be equal
to that contained by the means, the four straight lines are
proportional.
[vi. 1 6 ]
Therefore, as A is to B, so is D to C.
But B is equal to D;
therefore, as A is to B, so is B to C.
Therefore etc.
Q. E. D.

VI. 17 is, of course, a particular case o f VI. 1 6 .

PROPOSITION

On a given straight line to describe a rectilineal figure
similar and similarly situated to a given rectilineal figure.
Let AB be the given straight line and CE the given
rectilineal figure;
thus it is required to describe on the straight line AB a.
rectilineal figure similar and similarly situated to the recti­
lineal figure CE.

Let DE be joined, and on the straight line AB, and at
the points A, B on it, let the angle GAB be constructed
equal to the angle at C, and the angle ABG equal to the
angle CDF.
[1. 2 3 ]
Therefore the remaining angle CFD is equal to the angle
AGB;

Therefore, proportionally, as FD
