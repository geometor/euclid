D e Morgan would rearrange Props. 1 8 and 2 0 in the following manner.
H e would combine Prop. 1 8 and the first part of Prop. 2 0 into one, with the
enunciation:

Pairs of similar triangles, similarly put together, give similar figures ; and
every pair of similar figures is composed of pairs of similar triangles
similarly
put
together.
H e would then make the problem o f vi. 1 8 an application of the first part.
I n form this would certainly appear to be an improvement; but, provided that
the relation o f the propositions is understood, the matter o f form is perhaps
not o f great importance.

PROPOSITION

I 9.

Similar triangles are to one another in the duplicate ratio
of the corresponding sides.
Let ABC, DEF be similar triangles having the angle at
B equal to the angle at E, and such that, as AB is to BC, so
5 is DE to EF, so that BC corresponds to EF;
[v. Def. 1 1 ]
I say that the triangle ABC has to the triangle DEF
duplicate of that which BC has to EF.

a ratio

F o r let a third proportional BG be taken to BC, EF, so
that, as BC is to EF, so is EF to BG;
[vi. n ]
10 and let AG be joined.
Since then, as AB is to BC, so is DE to EF,
therefore, alternately, as AB

is to DE, so is BC to EF. [v. 1 6 ]
