ABC to the triangle ABG, that is DEF."
Such explanations in Porisms are
not in Euclid's manner, and the words are not in Campanus, though they date
from a time earlier than Theon.

PROPOSITION

Similar polygons are divided into similar triangles, and
into triangles equal in multitude and in the same ratio as
the wholes, and the polygon has to the polygon a ratio duplicate
of that which the corresponding side has to the corresponding
5 side.
Let ABCDE,

FGHKL

be similar polygons, and let AB

correspond to FG;

I say that the polygons ABCDE,

FGHKL

are divided into

similar triangles, and into triangles equal in multitude and in
10 the same ratio as the wholes, and the polygon ABCDE
has
to the polygon FGHKL a ratio duplicate of that which AB
has to FG.

Now, since the polygon ABCDE

,

s

H

K

is similar to the polygon

FGHKL,
the angle BAE

is equal to the angle GEL ;

and, as BA is to AE, so is GF to EL.

[vi. Def. 1 ]

Since then ABE,
FGL are two triangles having one
angle equal to one angle and the sides about the equal angles
20 proportional,
therefore the triangle ABE

is equiangular with the triangle

FGL ;

[vi. 6 ]

so that it is also similar ;
therefore the angle ABE

is equal to the angle

[vi. 4 and Def. 1 ]
FGL.
