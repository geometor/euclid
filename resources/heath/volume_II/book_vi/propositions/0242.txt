But the whole angle ABC is also equal to the whole angle
FGH because of the similarity of the polygons ;
therefore the remaining angle EBC

is equal to the angle

LGH.
.
3°

And, since, because of the similarity of the triangles A BE,

FGL,
as EB is to BA, so is LG to GF,
and moreover also, because of the similarity of the polygons,
as AB is to BC, so is FG to GH,

therefore, ex aequali, as EB is to BC, so is LG to GH; [v. 2 2 ]
35 that is, the sides about the equal angles EBC,
proportional;
therefore the triangle EBC

LGH

is equiangular with the triangle

LGH,

[vi. 6 ]

so that the triangle EBC
40

are

is also similar to the triangle

LGH.

[vi. 4 and Def. 1 ]

F o r the same reason
the triangle ECD

is also similar to the triangle

Therefore the similar polygons ABCDE,

LHK.

FGHKL

have

been divided into similar triangles, and into triangles equal in
45 multitude.
I say that they are also in the same ratio as the wholes,
that is, in such manner that the triangles are proportional,
and ABE, EBC, ECD are antecedents, while FGL,
LGH,
LHK are their consequents, and that the polygon
ABCDE
5 ° has to the polygon FGHKL
a ratio duplicate of that which
the corresponding side has to the corresponding side, that is
AB to FG.
F o r let A C, FH be joined.
Then since, because of the similarity of the polygons,
ss the angle ABC

is equal to the angle

FGH,

and, as AB is to BC, so is FG to GH,
the triangle ABC

is equiangular with the triangle

FGH;
[vi- 6 ]

therefore the angle BA C is equal to the angle GFH,
and the angle BCA to the angle GHF.
60
And, since the angle BAM is equal to the angle GFN,
and the angle ABM is also equal to the angle FGN,
