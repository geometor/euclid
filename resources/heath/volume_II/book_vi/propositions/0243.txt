therefore the remaining angle A MB is also equal to the
remaining angle FNG ;
[1. 3 2 ]
therefore the triangle ABM is equiangular with the triangle
6

S

FGN.
Similarly we can prove that
the triangle BMC is also equiangular with the triangle GNH.
Therefore, proportionally, as AM is to MB, so is FN to

NG,
70 and,

as BM is to MC, so is GN to

NH;

so that, in addition, ex aequali,
as AM is to MC, so is FN to NH.
But, as AM is to MC, so is the triangle ABM Xa MBC,
and A ME to EMC; for they are to one another as their
75 bases.
[vi. 1 ]
Therefore also, as one of the antecedents is to one of the
consequents, so are all the antecedents to all the consequents;
[v. 1 2 ]

therefore, as the triangle A MB

is to BMC,

so is ABE

to

CBE.

But, as A MB is to BMC, so is AM to MC;
therefore also, as AM is to MC, so is the triangle ABE
to
the triangle EBC.
F o r the same reason also,
as FN is to NH, so is the triangle FGL to the triangle

GLH.

And, as AM is to MC, so is FN to NH;
therefore also, as the triangle ABE
is to the triangle BEC,
so is the triangle FGL to the triangle
GLH;
and, alternately, as the triangle ABE is to the triangle FGL,
90 so is the triangle BEC to the triangle GLH.
Similarly we can prove, if BD, GK be joined, that, as the
triangle BEC is to the triangle LGH, so also is the triangle
ECD to the triangle LHK.
And since, as the triangle ABE
is to the triangle FGL,
95 so is EBC to LGH, and further ECD to
LHK,
therefore also, as one of the antecedents is to one of the
consequents, so are all the antecedents to all the consequents ;
[v. 12

therefore, as the triangle ABE

so is the polygon ABCDE

is to the triangle

to the polygon

FGL,

FGHKL.
