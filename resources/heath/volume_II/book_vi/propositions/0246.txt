For, since A is similar to C,
it is equiangular with it and has the sides about the equal
angles proportional.
[vi. Def. i ]

Again, since B is similar to C,
it is equiangular with it and has the sides about the equal
angles proportional.
Therefore each of the figures A, B is equiangular with C
and with C has the sides about the equal angles proportional;
therefore A is similar to B.
Q. E. D.

I t will be observed that the text above omits a step which the editions
generally have before the final inference " Therefore A is similar to B."
The
words omitted are " s o that A is also equiangular with B and [with B] has the
sides about the equal angles proportional."
Heiberg follows P in leaving
them out, conjecturing that they may be an addition of Theon's.

PROPOSITION 

2 2 .

If four straight lines be proportional, the rectilinealfigures
similar and similarly described upon them will also be pro­
portional; and, if the rectilinealfiguressimilar and similarly
described upon them be proportional, the straight lines will
themselves also be proportional.
Let the four straight lines AB,
portional,

CD, EF,

so that, as AB is to CD, so is EFto

GH,

GH be pro­

and let there be described on AB, CD the similar and similarlysituated rectilineal figures KAB,
LCD,
and on EF, GH the similar and similarly situated rectilineal
figures ME,
NH;
I say that, as KAB is to LCD, so is MF to NH.
F o r let there be taken a third proportional 0 to AB, CD,
and a third proportional P to EF, GH.
