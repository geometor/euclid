Then since, as AB is to CD, so is EF to GH,

I say also that, as AB is to CD, so is EF to

For, if EF is not to t 7 # as AB to CD,
let EF be to

and on QR let the rectilineal figure SR be described similar
and similarly situated to either of the two MF, NH.

Since then, as AB

therefore, as KAB is to LCD,

so is MF to

SR.

as KAB is to LCD, so is MF to NH;
therefore also, as MF is to SR, so is MF to NH.

[v. 11]

Therefore MF has the same ratio to each of the figures

NH, SR;
therefore NH

is equal to SR.

But it is also similar and similarly situated to it;
therefore GH is equal to QR.
