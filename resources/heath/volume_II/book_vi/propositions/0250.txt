which makes Euclid's proof o f v. 1 8 illegitimate, since it is nowhere proved
in Book v. H e n c e any proof o f the proposition now in question which
involves this assumption even in the case where B, P, Q are all straight lines
should not properly be given as an addition to Book v . ; it should at least be
postponed until we have learnt, by means of VI. 1 2 , giving the actual
construction o f a fourth proportional, that such a fourth proportional exists.
Two proofs which are given o f the proposition depend upon the following
lemma.
If A, B , C be three magnitudes
of one kind, and D, E , F three
magnitudes
of one kind, then, if
the ratio of A to B is greater
and

the ratio of B to C greater

ex aequali,

the ratio of A to C is greater

than that

ofDtoJL,

than that of E to F ,
than that of D toF.

One proof o f this does not depend upon che assumption referred to, and
therefore, i f this proof is used, the theorem can be added to Book v. T h e
proof is that o f Hauber (Camerer's Euclid, p. - 3 5 8 o f Vol. 11.) and is reproduced
by Mr H. M. Taylor. For brevity we will use symbols.
T a k e equimultiples mA, mD o f A, D and nB, nE of B, E such that
mA>nB,
Also let pB, pE
C,F such that

but

mD^-nE.

be equimultiples of B, E and qC, qF equimultiples of
pB>qC,

hvApElf-qF.

Therefore, multiplying the first line by / and the second by n, we have
pmA >pnB,
pmD
If-pnE,
and

npB>nqC,

whence

pmA > nq C, pmD

Now

npE1t*nqF,
nqF.

pmA, pmD are equimultiples o f mA, mD,

and

nqC, nqF equimultiples o f qC, qF.
Therefore [v. 3 ] they are respectively equimultiples of A, D and o f C, F.
H e n c e [v. Def. 7 ]

A:C>D:F.

Another proof given by Clavius, though depending on the assumption
referred to, is n e a t
T a k e G such that
G: C =
