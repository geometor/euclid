Suppose H taken such that

Therefore

Hence

Now we can prove that
Ratios

of which equal ratios are duplicate

Suppose that

are

equal.

A : B = B : C,

and

D : £ = £ : F,

and further that

A : C = D : F.

it is required ' o prove that
A : B = D : E.
For, if not, one of the ratios must be greater than the other.
Let A : B be the greater.
Then, since

A : B - B : C,

and

D : E = £ : F,

while

A:

£>£>:£,

it follows that

B : C>£

: F.

Hence, by the lemma, ex

aequali,
A : C>D

[v. 1 3 J

: F,

which contradicts the hypothesis.
Thus the ratios A : B and D: £ cannot be unequal; that is, they are equal.
Another proof, given by Dr Lachlan, also assumes the existence o f a
fourth proportional, but depends upon a simpler lemma to the effect that
// is impossible

that two different

ratios can have the same duplicate

ratio.

For, if possible, let the ratio A : B be duplicate both o f A : X and A : Y,
so that
and

A : X=X:

B,

A:

B.

Y= Y:

Let X be greater than Y.
Then

A : X<A

: Y;

[v. 8 ]

that is,

X : B <Y:

B,

[v. n , 1 3 ]

or

X<Y.

[v. 1 0 ]

But X is greater than Y: which is absurd, etc.
Hence

X=

Y.
