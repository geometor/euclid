E:F,

A:C=D:F.

T o prove that

A : B = D:

I f this is not so, suppose that
A : B = D : Z.
Since

A : C =-D : F,

therefore, inversely,

C:B

= F.Z,

or, inversely,

B : C = Z : F.

Therefore

A : B = Z : F.

But
Therefore
Also, by hypothesis,

[v. 1 1 ]

A : B = D : Z, by hypothesis.
D:Z=Z:F.

[v. 1 1 ]

D : E = E : F;

whence, by the lemma,
Therefore

[v. 2 2 ]

E = Z.
A : B --- D : E.

De Morgan remarks that the best way of remedying the defect in Euclid
is to insert the proposition (the lemma to the last proof) that it is impossible
that two different ratios can have the same duplicate ratio, " which," he says,
"immediately proves the second (or defective) case of the theorem." But this
seems to be either too much or too little: too much, if we choose to make
the minimum addition to Euclid (for that addition is a lemma which shall prove
that, if a duplicate ratio is a ratio o f equality, the ratio of which it is duplicate
is also one o f equality), and too little if the proof is to be altered in the more
fundamental manner explained above.
I think that, if Euclid's attention had been drawn to the defect in his
proof of vi. 2 2 and he had been asked to remedy it, he would have done so
by supplying what I have called the minimum lemma and not by making the
more fundamental alteration. T h i s I infer from Prop. 2 4 of the Data, where
he gives a theorem corresponding to the proposition that ratios of which equal
ratios are duplicate are equal.
T h e proposition in the Data is enunciated
thus : If three straight
lines be proportional,
and the first have to the third a
given ratio, it will also have to the second a given
ratio.
A, B, C being the three straight lines, so that
A : B = B : C,
and A : C being a given ratio, it is required to prove that A : B is also a
given ratio.
Euclid takes any straight line D, and first finds another, F, such that
D : F= A : C,
whence D : F must be a given ratio, and, as D is given, F is therefore given.
Then he takes E a mean proportional between D, F, so that
D:E

=

E:F.
