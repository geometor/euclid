It follows [vi. 1 7 ] that
the rectangle D, Fis equal to the square on E.
But D, Fare

both given;

therefore the square on E is given, so that E is also given.
[Observe that De Morgan's lemma is here assumed without proof. I t
may be proved ( 1 ) as it is by De Morgan, whose proof is that given above,
p. 2 4 5 , ( 2 ) in the manner o f the "minimum lemma," pp. 2 4 2 — 3 above, or
( 3 ) as it is by Proclus on 1. 4 6 (see note on that proposition).]
Hence the ratio D : E is given.
Now, since
A : C = D : F,
and
A : C= (square on A): (rect. A, C),
while
D : F= (square on D): (rect. D, F ) ,
[vi. 1 ]
therefore (square on A): (rect. A, C) = (square on D): (rect. D, F ) .

But, since A : B = B : C, (rect. A, C) - (sq. on B);

and (rect. D, F) = (sq. on E), from a b o v e ;
therefore (square on A) : (square on B) = (sq. on D) : (sq. on

squares.

Thus he deduces his proposition from vi. 2 2 , instead of proving vi. 2 2 by
means of it (or the corresponding proposition used by Mr Taylor and
Dr I.achlan).
PROPOSITION

23.

Equiangular parallelograms have to one another the ratio
compounded of tlie ratios of their sides.
Let AC, CF be equiangular parallelograms having the
angle BCD equal to the angle ECG;
5 I say that the parallelogram A C has to the parallelogram
CF the ratio compounded of the ratios of the sides.

For let them be placed so that BC is in a straight line
with CG;
therefore DC is also in a straight line with CE.

Let the parallelogram DG be completed ;
let a straight line K be set out, and let it be contrived that,
as BC is to CG, so is K to L,
and,
as DC is to CE, so is L to M.
