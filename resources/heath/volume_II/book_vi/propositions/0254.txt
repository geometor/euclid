Then the ratios of K to L and of L to M are the same
is as the ratios of the sides, namely of BC to CG and of DC
to CE.
But the ratio of K to M is compounded of the ratio of K
to L and of that of L to M;
so that K has also to M the ratio compounded of the ratios
ao of the sides.
Now since, as BC is to CG, so is the parallelogram AC
to the parallelogram CH,
[vi. 1 ]
while, as BC is to CG, so is K to L,
therefore also, as K is to L, so is AC to CH.

[v. n ]

Again, since, as DC is to CE, so is the parallelogram CH

to CF,

[vi. 1 ]

while, as DC is to CE, so is L to M,
therefore also, as L is to M, so is the parallelogram CH to
the parallelogram CF.
[v. u ]

Since then it was proved that, as K is to L, so is the
parallelogram AC to the parallelogram CH,
and, as L is to M,
parallelogram CF,

so is the parallelogram

CH to the

therefore, ex aequali, as K is to M, so is AC to the parallelo35 gram CF.
But K has to M the ratio compounded of the ratios of
the sides;
therefore A C also has to CF the ratio compounded of the
ratios of the sides.

T h e second definition of the Data says that A ratio is said to de given if
•we can find (iropla-atrdai) [another ratio that is] the same with it. Accordingly
vi. 2 3 not only proves that equiangular parallelograms have to one another a
ratio which is compounded of two others, but shows that that ratio is " g i v e n "
when its component ratios are given, or that it can be represented as a simple
ratio between straight lines.
