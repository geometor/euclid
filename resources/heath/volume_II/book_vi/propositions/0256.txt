But, since

KD = CF,
: CE = CG : CK.

CD

[vi. 1 4 ]

H e n c e CG : CK is a given ratio.
And CB : CK was proved to be a given ratio.
Therefore the ratio o f CB to CG is given.
[Data, Prop. 8 ]
l a s t l y we may refer to Prop. 7 0 of the Data, the first part of which proves
what corresponds exactly to vi. 2 3 , namely that, / / in two equiangular
paral­
lelograms the sides containing the equal angles have a given ratio to one another
[i.e. one side in one to one side in the other], the parallelograms
themselves
will
also have a given ratio to one another.
[ H e r e the ratios of BC to CG and of
CD to CE are given.]
The construction is the same as in the last case, and we have KD equal
to CF, so that
CD:
CE=CG
: CK.
[vi. 1 4 ]
But the ratio of CD to CE is given ;
therefore the ratio of CG to CK is given.
And, by hypothesis, the ratio of CG to CB is given.
Therefore, by dividing the ratios [Data,
Prop. 8 ] , we see that the ratio o f
CB to CK, and therefore [vi. 1 ] the ratio of AC to DK, or o f AC to CF,
is given.
Euclid extends these propositions to the case of two parallelograms which
have gtvm but not equal angles.
Pappus (vn. p. 9 2 8 ) exhibits the result of VI. 2 3 in a different way,
which throws new light on compounded ratios. He proves, namely, that a
parallelogram
is to an equiangular
parallelogram
as the rectangle contained by
the adjacent sides of the first is to the rectangle contained by the adjacent
sides
of the second.

Let AC, DFbe

the angles at B, E be equal.
Draw perpendiculars AG, DH to BC, EF respectively.
Since the angles at B, G are equal to those at E, H,

Thus it is proved that the ratio compounded of the ratios AB : DE and
EF is equal to the ratio of the rectangle AB, BC to the rectangle
EF.
