Since each parallelogram in the figure o f the proposition can be divided
into pairs of equal triangles, and all the triangles which are the halves o f either
parallelogram have two sides respectively equal and the angles included by
them equal or supplementary, it can be at once deduced from vi. 23 (or it
can be independently proved by the same method) that triangles
which
have
one angle of the one equal or supplementary-to
one angle of the other are in the
ratio compounded
of the ratios of the sides about the equal or
supplementary
angles.
Cf. Pappus vn. pp. 8 9 4 — 6 .
vi. 23 also shows that rectangles, and therefore parallelograms
or
triangles,
are to one another in the ratio compounded
of the ratios of their bases and
heights.
T h e converse of VI. 23 is also true, as is easily proved by rcductio ad
absurdum.
More generally, if two parallelograms
or triangles are in the ratio
compounded of the ratios of two adjacent sides, the angles included by those sides
are either equal or
supplementary.
PROPOSITION

24.

In any parallelogram the parallelograms about the diameter
are similar both to the whole and to one another.
Let A BCD be a parallelogram, and AC its diameter,
and let EG, HK be parallelograms
about AC;
A
E
B
I say that each of the parallelograms
EG, HK is similar both to the whole

ABCD

and to the other.

For, since EF has been drawn
parallel to BC, one of the sides of the
triangle ABC,
proportionally, as BE is to EA, so is CF to FA.
[vi. 2]
Again, since FG has been drawn parallel to CD, one of
the sides of the triangle ACD,
proportionally, as CF is to FA, so is DG to GA.
[vi. 2 ] .
But it was proved that,
as CF is to FA, so also is BE to EA ;
therefore also, as BE is to EA, so is DG to GA,

and therefore, componendo,
as BA is to AE, so is DA to AG,
[v. 1 8 ]
and, alternately,
as BA is to AD, so is EA to AG.
[v. 1 6 ]
Therefore in the parallelograms ABCD, EG, the sides
about the common angle BAD are proportional.
And, since GE is parallel to DC,
