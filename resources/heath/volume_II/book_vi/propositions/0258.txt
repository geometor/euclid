the angle AEG is equal to the angle DC A ;
and the angle DAC is common to the two triangles

ADC,

AGF;
therefore the triangle ADC

is equiangular with the triangle

AGF.
F o r the same reason
the triangle ACB is also equiangular with the triangle

AFE,
and the whole parallelogram ABCD
parallelogram EG.
Therefore, proportionally,

is equiangular with the

as AD is to DC, so\?> AG to GF,
as DC is to CA, so is GF to FA,
as AC is to CB, so is AF to EE,
and further, as CB is to BA, so is EE to
And, since it was proved that,
as DC is to CA, so is GF to / v / ,
and, as
is to CB, so is
to EE,
therefore, ex aequali, as DC is to C Z ? , so is GF to i^Z* . [v. 2 2 J
Therefore in the parallelograms ABCD, EG the sides
about the equal angles are proportional ;
therefore the parallelogram ABCD is similar to the parallelo­
gram EG.
[vi. Def. 1 ]
-

F o r the same reason
the parallelogram ABCD

is also similar to the parallelogram

KH;
therefore each of the parallelograms EG,

HK

is similar to

ABCD.
But figures similar to the same rectilineal figure are also
similar to one another ;
[vi. 2 1 ]
therefore the parallelogram EG is also similar to the parallelo­
gram HK.
Therefore etc.
Q. E. D.

Simson was o f opinion that this proof was made up by some unskilful
editor out of two others, the first of which proved by parallels (vi. 2 ) that
the sides about the common angle in the parallelograms are proportional,
while the other used the similarity o f triangles (vi. 4 ) . It is of course true
