doubt due to the accident by which the figure was drawn as a triangle in the
diagram.
T h e other observation is more important.
After Euclid has proved that
(fig. ABC)

: (fig. KGH)

= (BE)

(EE),

:

he might have inferred directly from v. 1 4 that, since ABC is equal to BE,
KGH
is equal to EF.
For v. 1 4 includes the proof o f the fact that, if A is
to B as C is to D, and A is equal to C, then B is equal to D, or that of four
proportional magnitudes, if the first is equal to the third, the second is equal
to the fourth.
Instead of proceeding in this way, E u c l i d first permutes the
proportion by v. 1 6 into
(fig. ABC)

: (BE)

= (fig. KGH)

(EF),

:

and then infers, as if the inference were easier in this form, that, since the
first is equal to the second, the third is equal to the fourth.
Y e t there is no
proposition to this effect in Euclid. T h e same unnecessary step of permutation
is also found in the Greek text of x i . 2 5 and x n . 2, 5 , 1 1 , 12 and 1 8 . In
reproducing the proofs we may simply leave out the steps and refer to v. 1 4 .

PROPOSITION

26.

If from a parallelogram there be taken away a parallelo­
gram similar and similarly situated to the whole and having
a common angle with it, it is about the same diameter with the
whole
For from the parallelogram ABCD
away the parallelogram AF similar and
similarly situated to ABCD, and having
the angle DAB common with it j

let there be taken

I say that ABCD is about the same
diameter with AF.
F o r suppose it is not, but, if possible,

let AHC be the diameter < of ABCD > ,
let GF be produced and carried through
to H, and let HK be drawn through H
parallel to either of the straight lines AD, BC.
[1. 3 1 ]
Since, then, ABCD is about the same diameter with KG,
therefore, as DA is to AB, so is GA to AK.
[vi. 2 4 ]
But also, because of the similarity of ABCD,
EG,
as DA is to AB, so is GA to
therefore also, as GA is to AK,

AE;

so is GA to AE.

[v. n ]

Therefore GA has the same ratio to each of the straight
lines AK,
AE.
