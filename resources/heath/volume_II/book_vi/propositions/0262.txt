Therefore AE is equal to AK [v. 9 ] , the less to the
greater: which is impossible.
Therefore ABCD cannot but be about the same diameter
with AF;
therefore the parallelogram ABCD
with the parallelogram AF.

is about the same diameter

Therefore etc.
Q. E. D.

" F o r suppose it is not, but, if possible, let AHC be the diameter." What
is meant is " For, if AFC is not the diameter o f the parallelogram AC, let
AHC
be its diameter." T h e Greek text has IO-TUI am&v Sia'/xtTpos ij A ® r ;
but clearly airwv is wrong, as we cannot assume that one straight line is the
diameter o f both parallelograms, which is just what we have to prove. F and
V omit the airtHv, and Heiberg prefers this correction to substituting airov
after Peyrard. I have inserted " < o f ABCD
> " to make the meaning clear.
I f the straight line AHC does not pass through F, it must meet either
GF or GF produced in some point H.
T h e reading in the text " and let
GF be produced
and carried through to H " ( r a i UfikriOtia-a. rj HZ &i-q\6a> fcri
TO ©) corresponds to the supposition that H is on GF produced.
T h e words
were left out by T h e o n , evidently because in the figure o f the MSS. the letters
E, Z and K, © were interchanged.
Heiberg therefore, following August, has
preferred to retain the words and to correct the figure, as well as the passage in
the text where AE, AJCwere
interchanged to be in accord with the MS. figure.
It is o f course possible to prove the proposition directly, as is done by
Dr Lachlan. Let AF, AC be the diagonals, and let us make no assumption
as to how they fall.
T h e n , since EF is parallel to AG and therefore to BC,
the angles AEF,

ABC

are equal.

And, since the parallelograms are similar,
AE

H e n c e the triangles AEF,

: EF=

ABC

AB

[vi. Def. 1 ]

: BC.

[vi. 6 ]

are similar,

and therefore the angle FAE is equal to the angle

CAB.

Therefore AF falls on AC.
T h e proposition is equally true if the parallelogram which is similar and
similarly situated to the given parallelogram is not " taken
away" from it, but is so placed that it is entirely outside the
other, while two sides form an angle vertically opposite to
f\~\
an angle o f the other.
I n this case the diameters are not
/ \ i
O
" t h e same," in the words o f the enunciation, but are in
Q Af\
7
a straight line with one another. T h i s extension o f the
/ \
/
proposition is, as will b e seen, necessary for obtaining,
/
\
/
according to the method adopted by Euclid in his soluI
jJ
tion o f the problem in vi. 2 8 , the second solution of that
problem.
