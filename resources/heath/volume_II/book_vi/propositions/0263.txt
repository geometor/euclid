Of all the parallelograms applied to the same straight line
and deficient by parallelogrammicfiguressimilar and similarly
situated to that described on the half of the straight line, that
parallelogram is greatest which is applied to the half of the
straight line and is similar to the defect.
Let AB be a straight line and let it be bisected at C;
let there be applied to the straight
line AB
the parallelogram AD
o
E
deficient by the parallelogrammic
V X 'l
\H
figure DB described on the half of
AB, that is, CB;
I say that, of all the parallelograms
applied to AB
and deficient by
parallelogrammic figures similar and
similarly situated to DB, AD is greatest.

For let there be applied to the straight line AB the
parallelogram AF deficient by the parallelogrammic figure
FB similar and similarly situated to DB;
I say that AD is greater than AF.
For, since the parallelogram DB is similar to the parallelo­
gram FB,
they are about the same diameter.
[vi. 2 6 ]
Let their diameter DB be drawn, and let the figure be
described.
Then, since CF is equal to FE,
[1. 4 3 ]
and FB is common,
therefore the whole CH is equal to the whole KE.
But CH is equal to CG, since AC is also equal to CB.
[1. 3 6 ]

Therefore GC is also equal to EK.
Let CF be added to each ;
therefore the whole AF'is equal to the gnomon
LMN;
so that the parallelogram DB, that is, AD, is greater than
the parallelogram AF.
Therefore etc.
