Dechales in their editions of the Elements, who pretend that they are scarce
of any use."
It is strange that, with this observation before him, even Todhunter should
have written as follows. " We have omitted in the sixth Book Propositions
27, 2 8 , 2 9 and the first solution which Euclid gives o f Proposition 3 0 , as they
appear now to be never required, and have been condemned as useless by
various modern commentators; see Austin, Walker and Lardner."
vi. 2 7 contains the 810010710s, the condition for a real solution, of the
problem contained in the proposition following it. T h e maximum o f all the
parallelograms having the given property which can be applied to a given
straight line is that which is described upon half the line (TO dirb r!js 17/ito-ct'af
ayaypaipofifvoy). T h i s corresponds to the condition that an equation of the
form
ux - px? = A
may have a real root. T h e correctness of the result may be seen by taking
the case in which the parallelograms are
rectangles, which enables us to leave out
£
of account the sine of the angle o f the
parallelograms without any real loss of
generality. Suppose the sides of the rect­
angle to which the defect is to be similar
to be as b to c, b corresponding to the
B

A
side of the defect which lies along AB.
Suppose that AKFG
is any parallelogram
applied to AB having the given property, that AB = a, and that
FK=x.
Then

AK=a--x.

Hence (a — - *\ x = S, where S is the area o f the rectangle

AKFG.

Thus, given the equation
ax - - x? = S,
c
where 5 is undetermined, VI. 2 7 tells us that, if x is to have a real value, 5
cannot be greater than the rectangle CE.
Now CB = - , and therefore CD = 7 . - :

which is just the same result as we obtain by the algebraical method.
In the particular case where the defect o f the parallelogram is to be *
square, the condition becomes the statement o f the fact that, if a straight
line
be divided into two parts, the rectangle contained
by the parts cannot exceed the
square on half the line.
Now suppose that, instead of taking F on BD as in the figure o f the
proposition, we take F on BD produced beyond D but so that DF is less
than BD.
Complete the figure, as shown, after the manner o f the construction in
the proposition.
