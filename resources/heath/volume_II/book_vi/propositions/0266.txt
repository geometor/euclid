This other ** case " o f the proposition is found in all the MSS., but Heiberg
relegates it to the Appendix as being very obviously interpolated. T h e
reasons for this course are that it is not in Euclid's manner to give a separate
demonstration o f such a " case " ; it is rather his habit to give one case only
and to leave the student to satisfy himself about any others (cf. 1. 7 ) . Internal
evidence is also against the genuineness o f the separate proof. It is put after
the conclusion o f the proposition instead of before it, and, if Euclid had intended
to discuss two cases, he would have distinguished them at the beginning of
the proposition, as it was his invariable practice to do. Moreover the second
" c a s e " is the less worth giving because it can be so easily reduced to the
first. F o r suppose F' to be taken on BD so that FD = F D.
Produce BF
to meet AG produced in P.
Complete the parallelogram BAPQ,
and draw
through F' straight lines parallel to and meeting its opposite sides.
T h e n the complement F'Q is equal to the complement AF'.
And it is at once seen that AF, F'Q are equal and similar. Hence the
solution of the problem represented by AF or F'Q gives a parallelogram of
the same size as AF' arrived at as in the first " case."
I t is worth noting that the actual difference between the parallelogram
AF and the maximum area AD that it can possibly have is represented in
the figure. T h e difference is the small parallelogram DF.

PROPOSITION

28.

To a given straight line to apply a parallelogram equal to
a given rectilineal figure and deficient by a parallelogrammic
figure similar to a given one: thus the given rectilineal figure
must not be greater than the parallelogram described on the
half of the straight line and similar to the defect.
Let AB be the given straight line, C the given rectilineal
figure to which the figure to be applied to AB is required to
be equal, not being greater than the parallelogram described
on the half of AB and similar to the defect, and D the
parallelogram to which the defect is required to be similar;
