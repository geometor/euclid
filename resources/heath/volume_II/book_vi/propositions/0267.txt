thus it is required to apply to the given straight line AB a
parallelogram equal to the given rectilineal figure C and
deficient by a parallelogrammic figure which is similar to D.

Let AB be bisected at the point E, and on EB let EBFG
be described similar and similarly situated to D ;

[vi. 18]

let the parallelogram A G be completed.
If then AG is equal to C, that which was enjoined will
have been done;
for there has been applied to the given straight line AB
the parallelogram AG equal to the given rectilineal figure C
and deficient by a parallelogrammic figure GB which is similar
to D.

But, if not, let HE be greater than C.
Now HE is equal to GB;
therefore GB is also greater than C.
Let KLMN be constructed at once equal to the excess
by which GB is greater than C and similar and similarly
situated to D.
[vi. 2 5 ]
But D is similar to GB;
therefore KM is also similar to GB.
[vi. 2 1 ]
Let, then, KL correspond to GE, and LM to GF.
Now, since GB is equal to C, KM,
therefore GB is greater than KM;
therefore also GE is greater than KL, and GF than
Let GO be made equal to KL, and GP equal to

LM.
LM;

and let the parallelogram OGPQ be completed ;
therefore it is equal and similar to KM.
Therefore GQ is also similar to GB;
therefore GQ is about the same diameter with GB.
