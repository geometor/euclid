As already remarked, vi. 2 8 is the geometrical equivalent of the solution
of the quadratic equation
ax — - x* m S,
c
subject to the condition necessary to admit of a real solution, namely that

•f. 4
T h e corresponding proposition in the Data is (Prop. 5 8 ) , If a given
(area)
be applied (i.e. in the form o f a parallelogram) to a given straight line and be
deficient by a figure (i.e. a parallelogram) given in species, the breadths of the
defect are given.
T o exhibit the exact correspondence between Euclid's geometrical and
the ordinary algebraical method o f solving the equation we will, as before
(in order to avoid bringing in a constant dependent on the sine of the angle
of the parallelograms), suppose the parallelograms to be rectangles. T o solve
the equation algebraically we change the signs and write it
-x>-ax

=

-S.

We may now complete the square by adding -y . —

H e first describes GEBF
on EB (half o f AB) similar to the given
parallelogram D.
H e then places in one angle FGE o f GEBF
a similar and similarly
situated parallelogram GQ, equal to the difference between the parallelogram
GB and the area C.
With our notation,

whence

OQ=GO.-.
