I t will be observed that Euclid only gives one solution, that corresponding
to the negative sign before the radical. But the reason must be the same as that
for which he only gives one " c a s e " in vi. 2 7 . He cannot have failed to see how
to add GO to GE would give another solution. As shown under the last
proposition, the other solution can be arrived at
( 1 ) by placing the parallelogram GOQP
in
the angle vertically opposite to FGE so that
GQ lies along BG produced.

( 2 ) A parallelogram similar and equal to AQ' can also be obtained by
producing BG till it meets A T produced and completing the parallelogram
B'ABA',
whence it is seen that the complement QA' is equal to the comple­
ment AQ, besides being equal and similar and similarly situated to AQ'.
A particular case of this proposition, indicated in Prop. 8 5 of the Data, is
that in which the sides of the defect are equal, so that the defect is a rhombus
with a given angle. Prop. 8 5 proves that, If two straight
