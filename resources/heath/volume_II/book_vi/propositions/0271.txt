PROPOSITION

29.

To a given straight line to apply a parallelogram equal to
a given rectilineal figure and exceeding by a parallelogrammic
figure similar to a given one.
Let AB be the given straight line, C the given rectilineal
figure to which the figure to be applied to AB is required to
be equal, and D that to which the excess is required to be
similar;
thus it is required to apply to the straight line AB a parallelo­
gram equal to the rectilineal figure C and exceeding by a
parallelogrammic figure similar to D.

Let AB

be bisected at E ;

let there be described on EB
and similarly situated to D ;

the parallelogram BF

similar

and let GH be constructed at once equal to the sum of BF,
C and similar and similarly situated to D.
[vi. 2 5 ]
Let KH correspond to FL and KG to
Now, since GH is greater than FB,
therefore KH

EE.

is also greater than FL, and KG than

EE.
