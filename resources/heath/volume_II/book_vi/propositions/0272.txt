Let FL, FE be produced,
let ELM be equal to KH, and FEN to KG,
and let MN be completed ;
therefore MN is both equal and similar to GH.
But GH is similar to EL ;
therefore MN is also similar to EL ;
[vi. 2 1 ]
therefore EL is about the same diameter with MN.
[vi. 2 6 ]
Let their diameter FO be drawn, and let the figure be
described.
Since GH is equal to EL, C,
while GH is equal to MN,
therefore MN is also equal to EL, C.
Let EL be subtracted from each ;
therefore the remainder, the gnomon XWV, is equal to C.
Now, since AE is equal to EB,
AN is also equal to NB [1. 3 6 ] , that is, to LP [1. 4 3 ] .
Let EO be added to each ;
therefore the whole AO is equal to the gnomon VWX.
But the gnomon VWX is equal to C;
therefore AO is also equal to C.
Therefore to the given straight line AB there has been
applied the parallelogram A 0 equal to the given rectilineal
figure C and exceeding by a parallelogrammic figure QP
which is similar to D, since PQ is also similar to EL [vi. 2 4 ] .
Q. E. F.
T h e corresponding proposition in the Data is (Prop. 5 9 ) , If a given

be applied (i.e. in the form of a parallelogram) to a given straight line
exceeding
by a figure given in species, the breadths of the excess are given.

In this case Euclid's construction on EB of the parallelogram
