Euclid takes, in this case, the solution corresponding to the positive sign
before the radical because, from his point o f view, that would be the only
solution.
No Siopia-fim is necessary because a real geometrical solution is always
possible whatever be the size of S.
Again the Data has a proposition indicating the particular case in which
the excess is a rhombus with a given angle. Prop. 8 4 proves that, If two
straight lines contain a given area in a given angle, and one of the straight
lines
is greater than the other by a given straight line, each of the two straight lines is
given also.
T h e proof reduces the proposition to a particular case of Data,
Prop. 5 9 , quoted above as corresponding to vi. 2 9 .
Again there is an important particular case which can be solved by means
of Book 11, only, as shown under II. 6 above (Vol. 1. pp. 3 8 6 — 8 ) , the case namely
in which the excess is a square, corresponding to the solution o f the equation

ax + x = 6*.
This is the problem of applying to a given straight
given area and exceeding by a square.

Let AB be the given finite straight line ;
thus it is required to cut AB in extreme and mean ratio.
On AB let the square BC be described ;

[vi. 2 9 ]
Now BC is a square ;
therefore AD is also a square.
And, since BC is equal to CD,
B
let CE be subtracted from each ;
therefore the remainder BF is equal to
the remainder AD.
