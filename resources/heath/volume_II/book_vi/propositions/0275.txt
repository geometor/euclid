been drawn from the right angle at A perpendicular to the
base BC,
the triangles ABD, ADC adjoin­
ing the perpendicular are similar
both to the whole ABC and to
one another.
[vi. 8 ]
And, since ABC is similar to

ABD,
therefore, as CB is to BA, so is
AB to BD.
[vi. Def. 1 ]
And, since three straight lines
are proportional,
as the first is to the third, so is the figure on the first to the
similar and similarly described figure on the second, [vi. i 9 , P o r . ]
Therefore, as CB is to BD, so is the figure on CB to the
similar and similarly described figure on BA.
For the same reason also,
as BC is to CD, so is the figure on BC to that on CA ;
so that, in addition,
as BC is to BD, DC, so is the figure on BC to the similar
and similarly described figures on BA,
AC.
But BC is equal to BD,
DC;
therefore the figure on BC is also equal to the similar and
similarly described figures on BA,
AC.
Therefore etc.
Q. E. D.

As we have seen (note on 1. 4 7 ) , this extension o f 1. 4 7 is credited by
Proclus to Euclid personally.
There is one inference in the proof which requires examination.
Euclid
proves that
CB
and that

: BD = (figure on CB) : (figure on

BC : CD = (figure on BC)

: (figure on

BA),
CA),

and then infers directly that
BC

: (BD + CD) = (fig. on BC)

: (sum of figs, on BA and

Apparently v. 2 4 must be relied on as justifying this inference.

But it is not

directly applicable ; for what it proves is that, if

then

(a + e): b = (e + /):

Thus we should invert

the first two proportions given above (by Simson's
