Prop. B which, as we have seen, is a direct consequence o f the definition of
proportion), and thence infer by v. 2 4 that

But

BD + CD is equal to

BC;

therefore (by Simson's Prop. A, which again is an immediate consequence o f
the definition o f proportion) the sum o f the figures on BA, AC is equal to
the figure on BC.
T h e M S S . again give an alternative proof which Heiberg places in the
Appendix. It first shows that the similar figures on the three sides have the
same ratios to one another as the squares on the sides respectively. Whence,
by using I . 4 7 and the same argument based on v. 2 4 as that explained above,
the result is obtained.
I f it is considered essential to have a proof which does not use Simson's
Props. B and A or any proposition but those actually given by Euclid, no
method occurs to me except the following.
Eucl. v. 2 2 proves that, if a, b, c are three magnitudes, and d, e, f three
others, such that
a : b = d : e,

b:e

=

e:f,

then, ex aequali,
a : c = d :/.
I f now in addition
a : b = b : c,
so that, also,
d : e = e :/,
the ratio a 1 t is duplicate of the ratio a : b, and the ratio d : f duplicate of
the ratio d : e, whence the ratios which are duplicate of equal ratios are equal.
Now (fig. on AC) : (fig. on AB) = the ratio duplicate o f AC : AB
= the ratio duplicate of CD : DA
= CD :

Hence
But

BD.

(sum o f figs, on AC, AB)
(fig. on BC)

: (fig. on AB) = BC : BD.
[v. 1 8 ]
: (fig. on AB) = BC : BD
(as in Euclid's proof).
Therefore the sum o f the figures on AC, AB has to the figure on AB the
same ratio as the figure on BC has to the figure on AB, whence
the figures on A C, AB are together equal to the figure on BC-

PROPOSITION

[v. 9 ]

32.

If two triangles having two sides proportional to two sides
be placed together at one angle so that their corresponding sides
are also parallel, the remaining sides of the triangles will be
in a straight line.
Let ABC, DCE be two triangles having the two sides
BA, AC proportional to the two sides DC, DE, so that, as
AB is to AC, so is DC to DE, and AB parallel to DC, and

AC to DE;'
I say that BC is in a straight line with CE.
