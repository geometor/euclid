For, since AB is parallel to DC,
and the straight line AC has fallen upon them,
the alternate angles BA C, A CD
are equal to one another. [1. 2 0 ]
For the same reason
the angle CDE is also
equal to the angle A CD;
so that the angle BAC is equal
to the angle CDE.
And, since ABC, DCE are
two triangles having one angle, the angle at A, equal to one
angle, the angle at D,
and the sides about the equal angles proportional,
so that, as BA

is to A C, so is CD to

therefore the triangle ABC
triangle DCE ;

DE,

is equiangular with

the
[vi. 6 ]

therefore the angle A BC is equal to the angle DCE.
But the angle ACD was also proved equal to the angle

BAC;
therefore the whole angle A CE is equal to the two angles

ABC, BAC.
Let the angle A CB be added to each ;
therefore the angles A CE, A CB are equal to the angles

ACB,

BAC,

CBA.

But the angles BAC,
angles;

ABC,

ACB

are equal to two right
[1. 3 2 ]

therefore the angles ACE,
right angles.

ACB

are also equal to two

Therefore with a straight line AC, and at the point C on
it, the two straight lines BC, CE not lying on the same side
make the adjacent angles ACE, ACB equal to two right
angles;
therefore BC is in a straight line with CE.
Therefore etc.

Q. E. D.

It has often been pointed out (e.g. by Clavius, Lardner and Todhunter)
that the enunciation of this proposition is not precise enough. Suppose that
