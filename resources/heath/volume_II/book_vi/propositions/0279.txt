through the common angular point are in one straight line. I f ABCF,
CDEG
be similar and similarly situated parallelograms,
so that BCG, DCF are straight lines, and if
A
c
the diagonals AC, CE be drawn, the triangles
ABC,
CDE are similar and are placed
exactly
as described in vi. 3 2 , so that AC, CE are in a
straight line.
H e n c e Simson suggests that
there may have been, in addition to the in­
direct demonstration in vi. 2 6 , a direct proof
covering the case just given which may have
used the result of vi. 3 2 . I think however
that the place given to the latter proposition in B o o k vi. is against this view.

PROPOSITION

33.

In equal circles angles have the same ratio as the circum­
ferences on which they stand, whether they stand at the centres
or at the circumferences.
Let ABC, DEF be equal circles, and let the angles BGC,
EHF be angles at their centres G, H, and the angles BA C,
EDF angles at the circumferences ;
I say that, as the circumference BC is to the circumference
EF, so is the angle BGC to the angle EHF, and the angle
BAC to the angle EDF.

For let any number of consecutive circumferences CK,
KL be made equal to the circumference BC,
and any number of consecutive circumferences EM, MN equal
to the circumference EF;
and let GK, GL, HM, HN be joined.
Then, since the circumferences BC, CK, KL are equal
to one another,
the angles BGC, CGK, KGL are also equal to one another;
