greater than two right angles, Euclid would no doubt have refused to regard
the latter as an angle, and would have represented it otherwise, e.g. as the
sum of two angles or as what is left when an angle in the true sense is sub­
tracted from four right angles. H e r e then, if Euclid had been asked what
course he would take if the multiples of the angles in question should be
greater than two right angles, he would probably have represented them, I
think, as being equal to so many right angles plus an angle less than a right
angle, or so many times two right angles plus an angle, acute or obtuse.
Then
the equality o f the arcs would be the equality of the sums of so many circum­
ferences, semi-circumferences or quadrants plus arcs less than a semicircle or
a quadrant.
H e n c e I agree with Mr Dodgson that VI. 33 affords no evidence
of a recognition by Euclid o f " angles " greater than two right angles
Theon adds to his theorem about sectors the Porism that, As the sector is
to the sector, so also is the angle to the angle.
T h i s corollary was used by
Zenodorus in his tract irepi icrop.(Tpmv tr^-qixajuiv preserved by Theon in his
commentary on Ptolemy's o-VIRA(;is, unless indeed T h e o n himself interpolated
the words (<us 8' 6 TO»fiis jrpos tov Top.ia, 77 viro E©A ytavia irpbi rqv virb M®A).
