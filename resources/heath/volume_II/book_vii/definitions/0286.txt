T h e definition of a number is again only one out ot many that are on
record. Nicomachus (1. 7, 1) combines several into one, saying that it is
" a defined multitude (wkijBm tapio-plvov), or a collection of units (pora'oW
o-io-Tr)p.a), or a flow of quantity made up of units " ( t t o o - o t i / t o s \vpa c k povdoW
o-vyKcip.€vov).
Theon, in words almost identical with those attributed by
Stobaeus (Eclogae,
1. 1, 8 ) to Moderatus, a Pythagorean, says (p. 18, 3 — 5 ) :
" A number is a collection of units, or a progression (7rpo7ro&o-p.o's) of mul­
titude beginning from an unit and a retrogression (a.va-rob'urp.os) ceasing at an
unit." According to Iamblichus (p. 10) the description "collection of units"
(povd&uiv o-u'o-TT/yiia) was applied to the how many, i.e. to number, by Thales,
following the Egyptian view (xara t o Alyvn-TiaKov dpeo-xoi'), while it was
Eudoxus the Pythagorean who said that a number was " a defined multitude"
(ir\rj8o% dpi.o-p.lvov).
Aristotle has a number of definitions which come to the
same thing: "limited multitude" (TrXrjBos to iren-epao-pivov, Metaph. 1020 a
13), " m u l t i t u d e " (or " c o m b i n a t i o n " ) " o f units" or "multitude of indivi­
sibles " (ibid. 1 0 5 3 a 3 0 , 1 0 3 9 a 12, 1085 b 2 2 ) , "several ones" (iva TrAct'cu,
Phys. 111. 7, 207 b 7 ) , "multitude measurable by o n e " (Metaph.
1057 a 3)
and " multitude measured and multitude of measures," the " measure " being
unity, t o iv (ibid. 1088 a 5 ) .

By a part Euclid means a submultiple, as he does in v. Def. 1, with which
definition this one is identical except for the substitution of number (dpiOpds)
for magnitude
(pkyidoi);
cf. note on v. Def. 1. Nicomachus uses the word
"submultiple" (uVo7roAAaTrAdo-ios) also. H e defines it in a way corresponding
to his definition of multiple (see note on Def. 5 below) as follows (1. 18, 2 ) :
" T h e submultiple, which is by nature first in the division of inequality
(called) less, is the number which, when compared with a greater, can
measure it more times than once so as to fill it exactly (irA^pownos)." Simi­
larly sub-double (uVooiirAdo-ios) is found in Nicomachus meaning half, and
so on.

By the expression parts (peprj, the plural of p.tpos) Euclid denotes what we
should call a proper fraction.
T h a t is, a part being a submultiple, the rather
inconvenient term parts means any number of such submultiples making up
a fraction less than unity. I have not, found the word used in this special
sense elsewhere, e.g. in Nicomachus, T h e o n of Smyrna or Iamblichus, except
in one place of Theon (p. 79, 2 6 ) where it is used of a proper fraction, of
which % is an illustration.
