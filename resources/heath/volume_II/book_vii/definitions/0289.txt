in the case of 1 8 , the £ part is called after the even number 2, but its value is
the odd number 9, and the J r d part is called after the odd number 3 , while its
value is the even number 6 , and so on.
T h e third class of even numbers according to the strict subdivision is the
odd-even («pio-o-dpno?). Numbers are of this class when they can be halved
twice or more times successively, but the quotient left when they can no
longer be halved is an odd number and not unity. T h e y are therefore o f
the form 2 " ( 2 » + i ) , where n, m are integers. T h e y are, so to say, inter­
mediate between, or a mixture of, the extreme classes even-times even and evenodd, for the following reasons. ( 1 ) Their subdivision by 2 proceeds for some
way like that o f the even-times even, but ends in the way that the division of
the even-odd by 2 ends. ( 2 ) T h e numbers after which submultiples are
called and their value (owapts) in units may be both of one kind, i.e. both odd
or both even (as in the case of the even-times even), or again may be one odd
and one even as in the case of the even-odd. For example 2 4 is an odd-even
number; the | t h , Vth, J t h or £ parts o f it are even, but the J r d part o f it,
or 8 , is even, and the ^th part o f it, or 3 , is odd. ( 3 ) Nicomachus shows
(1. 1 0 , 6 — 9 ) how to form all the numbers of the odd-even class. Set out two
lines (a) of odd numbers beginning with 3 , (b) o f even-times even numbers
beginning with 4 , thus :

Now multiply each o f the first numbers into each 6 f the second row. L e t
the products of one of the first into all the second set make horizontal rows;
we then get the rows

and so on.
Now, says Nicomachus, you will b e surprised to see (fpavijo-frai croi tfaupao-TIOS) that (a) the vertical rows have the property of the even-odd series, 6 , 1 0 ,
14, 1 8 , 2 2 etc., viz. that, if an odd number of successive numbers be taken,
the middle number is half the sum o f the extremes, and if an even number,
the two middle numbers together are equal to the sum o f the extremes,
(b) the horizontal
rows have the property o f the even-times even series 4 , 8 , 1 6
etc., viz. that the product of the extremes of any number o f successive terms
is equal, if their number be odd, to the square o f the middle term, or, if their
number be even, to the product of the two middle terms.
Let us now return to Euclid. His 9 t h definition states that an even-times
odd number is a number which, when divided by an even number, gives an
odd number as quotient. Following this definition in our text comes a 1 0 t h
definition which defines an odd-times even n u m b e r ; this is stated to be a
number which, when divided by an odd number, gives an even number as
quotient. According to these definitions any even-times
odd number would
also be odd-times even, and, from the fact that Iamblichus notes this, we may
fairly conclude that he found Def. 1 0 as well as Def. 9 in the text o f Euclid
which he used. But, if both definitions are genuine, the enunciations o f ix. 3 3
and ix. 3 4 as we have them present difficulties, i x . 3 3 says that " I f a num­
ber have its half odd, it is even-times odd only "; but, on the assumption that
