4. I f the third dimension is less than the others, the number is equal by
equal by less (JO-OKH ib-os c'Aarroi'dias) and is called a plinth (ttXivOk), e.g.
8 . 8 . 3 .

5. I f the third dimension is greater than the others, the number is equal
by equal by greater
(io-diat «ros ptifrWias) and is called a beam (oWs), e.g.
3.3.7.
Another name for this latter kind of number (according to
Iamblichus) was trtojKk (diminutive of cmfAij).
Lastly, in connexion with pyramidal numbers, Nibomachus (11. 1 4 , 5 ) dis­
tinguishes numbers corresponding to frusta of pyramids. T h e s e are
truncated
(KO'AOVOOI), twice-truncated
(oWAovpoi), thrice-truncated
(rpucokovpoi) pyramids,
and so on, the term being used mostly in theoretic treatises (iv a-vyypdppao-i
poA.t<rra TOIS OtuipripMTiKoU). T h e truncated
pyramid was formed by cutting
off the point forming the vertex. T h e twice-truncated
was that which lacked
the vertex and the next plane, and so on. Theon of Smyrna (p. 4 2 , 4 ) only
mentions the truncated
pyramid as " t h a t with its vertex cut off" (r) rr)v
Kopvtpriv aTroTiTpripivri), saying that some also called it a trapezium, after the
similitude of a plane trapezium formed by cutting the top off a triangle
by a straight line parallel to the base.

A particular kind of square distinguished by Nicomachus and the rest was
the square number which ended (in the decimal notation) with the same
number as its side, e.g. 1, 2 5 , 3 6 , which are the squares of 1, 5 and 6 . T h e s e
square numbers were called cyclic (kvkKikoi) on the analogy of circles in
geometry which return again to the point from which they started.

Similarly cube numbers which ended with the same number as their sides,
and the squares of those sides also, were called spherical (o-tftcupiKot) or
recurrent
(oVoKaTaoraTiKoi). One might have expected that the term spherical would be
applicable also to the cubes of numbers which ended with the same digit as the
side but not necessarily with the same digit as the square of the side also.
E.g. the cube of 4 , i.e. 6 4 , ends with the same digit as 4 , but not with the
same digit as 1 6 . But apparently 6 4 was not called a spherical number, the
only instances given by Nicomachus and the rest being those cubed from
numbers ending with 5 or 6 , which end with the same digit if squared.
A
spherical number is in fact derived from a circular number only, and that by
adding another equal dimension. Obviously, as Nesselmann says, the names
cyclic and spherical applied to numbers appeal to an entirely different principle
from that on which the figured numbers so far dealt with were formed.
