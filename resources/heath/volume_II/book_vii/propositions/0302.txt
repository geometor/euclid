PROPOSITION

I.

Two unequal numbers being set out, and the less being
continually subtracted in turn from the greater, if the number
which is left never measures the one before it until an unit is
left, the original numbers will be prime to one another.
For, the less of two unequal numbers AB,
continually subtracted from the greater, let the
number which is left never measure the one
before it until an unit is left;

CD

being

I say that AB, CD are prime to one another,
that is, that an unit alone measures AB,
CD.
For, if AB, CD are not prime to one another,
some number will measure them.
Let a number measure them, and let it be
E; let CD, measuring BF, leave FA less than
itself,
let AF,

measuring DG, leave GC less than itself,

and let GC, measuring FH,

leave an unit

HA.

Since, then, E measures CD, and CD measures BF,
therefore E also measures

BF.

But it also measures the whole BA ;
7

therefore it will also measure the remainder-/?/ '.
But AF

measures DG ;

therefore E also measures DG.
