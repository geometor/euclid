PROPOSITION 

2 .

Given two numbers not prime to one another, to find their
greatest common measure.
Let AB, CD be the two given numbers not prime to one
another.
Thus it is required to find the greatest
common measure of AB, CD.
If now CD measures AB—and it also
L
measures itself—CD is a common measure of
1
CD, AB.
1
And it is manifest that it is also the greatest;
for no greater number than CD will measure
A

c

E

B

D

CD.
But, if CD does not measure AB, then, the less of the
numbers AB,
CD being continually subtracted from the
greater, some number will be left which will measure the one
before it.
F o r an unit will not be left; otherwise AB, CD will be
prime to one another [vn. 1], which is contrary to the
hypothesis.
Therefore some number will be left which will measure
the one before it.
Now let CD, measuring BE, leave EA less than itself,
let EA, measuring DF, leave EC less than itself,
and let CF measure

AE.

Since then, CF measures AE,
therefore CF will also measure

and AE

measures DF,

DF.

But it also measures itself;
therefore it will also measure the whole CD.
But CD measures BE ;
therefore CF also measures

BE.

But it also measures EA ;
therefore it will also measure the whole

BA.

But it also measures CD ;
therefore CF measures AB,

CD.

Therefore CF is a common measure of AB,

CD.
