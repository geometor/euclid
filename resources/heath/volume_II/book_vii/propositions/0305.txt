I say next that it is also the greatest.
For, if CF is not the greatest common measure of AB,
CD, some number which is greater than CF will measure the
numbers AB,
CD.
Let such a number measure them, and let it be G.
Now, since G measures CD, while CD measures BE,
G also measures BE.
But it also measures the whole BA ;
therefore it will also measure the remainder
But AE

measures

AE.

DF;

therefore G will also measure

DF.

But it also measures the whole DC;
therefore it will also measure the remainder CF, that is, the
greater will measure the less: which is impossible.
Therefore no number which is greater than CFv/iW measure
the numbers AB, CD ;
therefore CF is the greatest common measure of AB,

CD.

PORISM. From this it is manifest that, if a number
measure two numbers, it will also measure their greatest
common measure.
Q. E. D.

Here we have the exact method of finding the greatest common measure
given in the text-books of algebra, including the reductio ad absurdum proof
that the number arrived at is not only a common measure but the greatest
common measure. T h e process of finding the greatest common measure
is simply shown thus :

b)a(p
pb
C)b(q
qc
d)c(r
rd
We shall arrive, says Euclid, at some number, say d, which measures the one
before it, i.e. such that c = rd. Otherwise the process would go on until we
arrived at unity. This is impossible because in that case a, b would be prime
to one another, which is contrary to the hypothesis.
Next, like the text-books of algebra, he goes on to show that d will be some
common measure of a, b. For d measures c;
therefore it measures qc + d, that is, b,
and hence it measures pb + c, that is, a.
Lastly, he proves that d is the greatest common measure of a, b as follows.
Suppose that e is a common measure greater than d.
Then e, measuring a, b, must measure a-pb, or c.
