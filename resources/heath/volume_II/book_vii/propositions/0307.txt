For, if D is not the greatest common measure of A, B, C,
some number which is greater than D will measure the numbers
A, B, C.
Let such a number measure them, and let it be E.
Since then E measures A, B, C,
it will also measure A, B;
therefore it will also measure the greatest common measure
of A, B.
[vn. 2, Por.]
But the greatest common measure of A, B is D;
therefore E measures D, the greater the less: which is
impossible.
Therefore no number which is greater than Z?will measure
the numbers A, B, C;
therefore D is the greatest common measure of A, B, C.
Next, let D not measure C;
I say first that C, D are not prime to one another.
For, since A, B, C are not prime to one another, some
number will measure them.
Now that which measures A, B, C will also measure A,
B, and will measure D, the greatest common measure of A, B.
[vn. 2, Por.]

But it measures C also ;
therefore some number will measure the numbers D, C;
therefore D, C are not prime to one another.
Let then their greatest common measure E be taken.
[vn. 2]

Then, since E measures D,
and D measures A, B,
therefore E also measures A, B.
But it measures C also ;
therefore E measures A, B, C;
therefore E is a common measure of A, B, C.
I say next that it is also the greatest.
For, if E is not the greatest common measure of A, B, C,
some number which is greater than E will measure the
numbers A, B, C.
Let such a number measure them, and let it be F.
