as we please. This is because any number measuring two numbers also
measures their greatest common measure; and hence we can find the G.C.M.
of pairs, then the G.C.M. of pairs of these, and so on, until only two numbers
are left and we find the G.C.M. of these. Euclid tacitly assumes this extension
in v n . 33, where he takes the greatest common measure of as many numbers
as we please.

PROPOSITION 

4.

Any number is either a part or parts of any number, the
less of the greater.
Let A, BC be two numbers, and let BC be. the less ;
I say that BC is either a part, or parts, of A.
For A, BC are either prime to one another
or not.
First, let A, BC be prime to one another.
Then, if BC be divided into the units in it,
each unit of those in BC will be some part of A ;
so that BC is parts of A.
Next let A, BC not be prime to one another;
then BC either measures, or does not measure, A.
If now BC measures A, BC is a part of A.
But, if not, let the greatest common measure D of A, BC
be taken ;
[vn. 2]
and let BC be divided into the numbers equal to D, namely
BE, EE, EC.
Now, since D measures A, D is a part of A.
But D is equal to each of the numbers BE, EE, EC;
therefore each of the numbers BE, EE, EC is also a part of A;
so that BC is parts of A.
Therefore etc.
Q. E. D.

The meaning of the enunciation is of course that, if a, b be two numbers
of which b is the less, then b is either a submultiple or some proper fraction of a.
(1) If a, b are prime to one another, divide each into its units; then b
contains b of the same parts of which a contains a. Therefore b is " parts " or
a proper fraction of a.
(2)
If a, b be not prime to one another, either b measures a, in which
case b is a submultiple or " part" of a, or, if g be the greatest common
measure of a, b, we may put a = mg and b = ng, and b will contain n of the
same parts (g) of which a contains m, so that b is again "parts," or a proper
fraction, of a.
