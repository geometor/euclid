PROPOSITION 

5.

If a number be a part of a number, and another be the
same part of another, the sum will also be the same part of the
sum that the one is of the one.
For let the number A be a. part of BC,
and another, D, the same part of another EF that A is of BC;
I say that the sum of A, D is also the same
part of the sum of BC, EF that A is of BC.
For since, whatever part A is of BC, D
is also the same part of EF,
therefore, as many numbers as there are in
BC equal to A, so many numbers are there
also in EF equal to D.
Let BC be divided into the numbers equal to A, namely
BG, GC,
and EF into the numbers equal to D, namely EH, HF;
then the multitude of BG, GC will be equal to the multitude
of EH, HF.
And, since BG is equal to A, and EH to D,
therefore BG, EH are also equal to A, D.
For the same reason
GC, HF are also equal to A, D.
Therefore, as many numbers as there are in BC equal to
A, so many are there also in BC, EF equal to A, D.
Therefore, whatever multiple BC is of A, the same multiple
also is the sum of BC, EF of the sum of A, D.
Therefore, whatever part A is of BC, the same part also
is the sum of A, D of the sum of BC, EF.
Q. E. D.

If

a=-b,
n

and c = -d,
n

a + c=l(6

then

+ d).

T h e proposition is of course true for any quantity of pairs of numbers
similarly related, as is the next proposition also; and both propositions are
used in the extended form in v n . 9, 10.
