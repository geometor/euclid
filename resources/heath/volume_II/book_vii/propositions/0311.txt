PROPOSITION 

6.

If a number be parts of a number, and another be the same
parts of another, the sum will also be the same parts of the sum
that the one is of the one.
For let the number AB be parts of the number C,
and another, DE, the same parts of another,
F, that AB is of C;
I say that the sum of AB, DE is also the
A
same parts of the sum of C, F that AB is
C
D
G
of C.
H
For since, whatever parts AB is of C,
B
E
DE is also the same parts of F,
therefore, as many parts of C as there are
in AB, so many parts of F are there also in DE.
Let AB be divided into the parts of C, namely AG, GB,
and DE into the parts of F, namely DH, HE;
thus the multitude of AG, GB will be equal to the multitude
oiDH,
HE.
And since, whatever part AG is of C, the same part is
DH of F also,
therefore, whatever part AG is of C, the same part also is the
sum of AG, DH of the sum of C, F.
[vn. 5]
For the same reason,
whatever part GB is of C, the same part also is the sum of
GB, HE of the sum of C, F.
Therefore, whatever parts AB is of C, the same parts also
is the sum of AB, DE of the sum of C, F.
Q. E. D.

If

a = — 0, ana c= — a,
n

then

a + c = — (b + d).

More generally, if

then

(a + c+ e + g + . ,.) = -(b
