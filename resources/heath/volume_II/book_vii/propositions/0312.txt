PROPOSITION

7.

If a number be that part of a number, which a number
subtracted is of a number subtracted, the remainder will also
be the same part of the remainder that the whole is of the
whole.
For let the number AB be that part of the number CD
which AE subtracted is of CF subtracted ;
I say that the remainder EB is also the same part of the
remainder FD that the whole AB is of the whole CD.

For, whatever part AE is of CF, the same part also let
EB be of CG.
Now since, whatever part AE is of CF, the same part
also is EB of CG,
therefore, whatever part AE is of CF, the same part also is
ABoiGF.
[vn. 5]
But, whatever part AE is of CF, the same part also, by
hypothesis, is AB of CD ;
therefore, whatever part AB is of GF, the same part is it of
CD also ;
therefore GF is equal to CD.
Let CF be subtracted from each ;
therefore the remainder GC is equal to the remainder FD.
Now since, whatever part AE is of CF, the same part
also is EB of GC,
while GC is equal to FD,
therefore, whatever part AE is of CF, the same part also is
EBoiFD.
But, whatever part AE is of CF, the same part also is AB
of CD;
