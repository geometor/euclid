therefore also the remainder EB is the same part of the
remainder FD that the whole AB is of the whole CD.
Q. E. D.

If

a = -b and c = -d, we are to prove that

a result differing from that of VII. 5 in that minus is substituted for plus.
Euclid's method is as follows.
Suppose that e is taken such that

Now

a-c = -e.
n
c = -d.

Therefore

a = i (d + e),

[vn. 5]

whence, from the hypothesis,
d+e = b,
so that
e = b-d,
and, substituting this value of e in (1), we have
a-c

=

-(b-d).

PROPOSITION 

8.

If a number be the same parts of a number that a number
subtracted is of a number subtracted, the remainder will also
be the same parts of the remainder that the whole is of the
whole.
For let the number AB be the same parts of the number
CD that AE subtracted is of CF
subtracted ;
c
if

I say that the remainder EB is

is of the whole CD.
For let GH be made equal to AB.
Therefore, whatever parts GH is of CD, the same parts
also is AE of CF.
Let GH be divided into the parts of CD, namely GK, KH,
and AE into the parts of CF, namely AL, LE;
thus the multitude of GK, KH will be equal to the multitude
of AL, LE.
