Now since, whatever part GK is of CD, the same part
also is AL of CF,
while. CD is greater than CF,
therefore GK is also greater than AL.
Let GM be made equal to AL.
Therefore, whatever part GK is of CD, the same part also
is GM of CF;
therefore also the remainder MK is the ;ame part of the
remainder FD that the whole GK is of the whole CD. [vn. 7]
Again, since, whatever part KH is of CD, the same part
also is EL of CF,
while CD is greater than CF,
therefore HK is also greater than EL.
Let KN be made equal to EL.
Therefore, whatever part KH is of CD, the same part
also is KN of CF;
therefore also the remainder NH is the same part of the
remainder FD that the whole KH is of the whole CD.
[vn. 7]
But the remainder MK was also proved to be the same
part of the remainder FD that the whole GK is of the whole
CD;
therefore also the sum of MK, NH is the same parts of DF
that the whole HG is of the whole CD.
But the sum of MK, NH is equal to EB,
and HG is equal to BA ;
therefore the remainder EB is the same parts of the remainder
FD that the whole AB is of the whole CD.
Q. E. D.

If

a = — b and c=—d,

then

a — c = — (b - d).

Euclid's proof amounts to the following.
T a k e e equal to - b, and / e q u a l to - d.
ft
Then since, by hypothesis, b > d,

*>/,
and, by VII. 7,

e-f=~(b-d).
