But BG is equal to A, and EH to D;
therefore, whatever part or parts A is of D, the same part or
the same parts is BC of EE also.
Q. E. D.

If a = - b and c = — d, then, whatever fraction (" part" or " parts") a is of
n

n

c, the same fraction will b be of d.
Dividing b into each of its parts equal to a, and d into each of its parts
equal to c, it is clear that, whatever fraction one of the parts a is of one of the
parts c, the same fraction is any other of the parts a of any other of the parts c.
A n d the number of the parts a is equal to the number of the parts c, viz. «.
Therefore, by v n . 5, 6, na is the same fraction of nc that a is of c, i.e. b is
the same fraction of d that a is of c.

PROPOSITION 

10.

If a number be parts of a number, and another be the
same parts of another, alternately also, whatever parts or part
the first is of the third, the same parts or the same part will
the second also be of the fourth.
For let the number AB be parts of the number C,
and another, DE, the same parts of another,
F;
I say that, alternately also, whatever parts or
part AB is of DE, the same parts or the
same part is C of F also.
For since, whatever parts AB is of C,
the same parts also is DE of F,
therefore, as many parts of C as there are
in AB, so many parts also of F are there in DE.
Let AB be divided into the parts of C, namely AG, GB,
and DE into the parts of F, namely DH, HE;
thus the multitude of AG, GB will be equal to the multitude
oiDH,
HE.
Now since, whatever part AG is of C, the same part also
is DH oiF,
alternately also, whatever part or parts A G is of DH,
the same part or the same parts is C of F also.
[vn. 9]
For the same reason also,
whatever part or parts GB is of HE, the same part or the
same parts is C of F also ;
