If four numbers be proportional, they zuill also be propor­
tional alternately.
Let the four numbers A, B, C, D be proportional, so that,
as A is to B, so is C to D ;
I say that they will also be proportional alternately, so that,
as A is to C, so will B be to D.
For since, as A is to B, so is C to D,
therefore, whatever part or parts A is of B,
the same part or the same parts is C of D also.
[vn. Def. 20]

Therefore, alternately, whatever part or
parts A is of C, the same part or the same
parts is B of D also.
Therefore, as A is to C, so is B to D.

Q. E. D.

If
a : b = c : d,
then, alternately,
a : c = b : d.
T h e proposition corresponds to v. 16 for magnitudes, and the proof
consists in connecting VII, Def. 20 with the result of v n . 10.

If there be as many numbers as we please, and others equal
to them in multitude, which taken two and two are in the same
ratio, they will also be in the same ratio ex aequali.
Let there be as many numbers as we please A, B, C,
and others equal to them in multitude D, E, F, which taken
two and two are in the same ratio, so that,
as A is to B, so is D to E,
and,
as B is to C, so is E to F;
I say that, ex aequali,
as A is to C, so also is D to F.

F

For, since, as A is to B, so is D to E,
therefore, alternately,
as A is to D, so is B to E.
