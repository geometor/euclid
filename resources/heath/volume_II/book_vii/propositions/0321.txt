I say that, alternately also, the

unit A measures the number
D the same number of times that BC measures EF.
For, since the unit A measures the number BC the same
number of times that D measures EF,
therefore, as many units as there are in BC, so many numbers
equal to D are there in EF also.
Let BC be divided into the units in it, BG, GH, HC,
and EF'\x\to the numbers EK, KL, LF equal to D.
Thus the multitude of BG, GH, HC will be equal to the
multitude of EK, KL, LF.
And, since the units BG, GH, HC are. equal to one another,
and the numbers EK, KL, LF are also equal to one another,
while the multitude of the units BG, GH, HC is equal to the
multitude of the numbers EK, KL, LF,
therefore, as the unit BG is to the number EK, so will the
unit GH be to the number KL, and the unit HC to the
number LF.
Therefore also, as one of the antecedents is to one of
the consequents, so will all the antecedents be to all the
consequents;
[vn. 12]
therefore, as the unit BG is to the number EK, so is BC to
EF.
But the unit BG is equal to the unit A,
and the number EK to the number D.
Therefore, as the unit A is to the number D, so is BC to
EF.
Therefore the unit A measures the number D the same
number of times that BC measures EF.

If there be four numbers 1, m, a, ma (such that 1 measures m the same
number of times that a measures ma), 1 measures a the same number of
times that m measures ma.
Except that the first number is unity and the numbers are said to measure
instead of being a part of others, this proposition and its proof do not differ
from v n . 9 j in fact this proposition is a particular case of the other.
