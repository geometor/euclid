PROPOSITION

16.

If two numbers by mtdtiplying one another make certain
numbers, the numbers so produced will be equal to one another.
Let A, B be two numbers, and let A by multiplying B
make C, and B by multiplying
A make D ;
I say that C is equal to D.
B
For, since A by multiplyc
———
ing B has made C,
o
therefore B measures C ac— E
cording to the units in A.
But the unit E also measures the number A according to
the units in it;
therefore the unit E measures A the same number of times
that B measures C.
Therefore, alternately, the unit E measures the number B
the same number of times that A measures C.
[vn. 15]
Again, since B by multiplying A has made D,
therefore A measures D according to the units in B.
But the unit E also measures B according to the units
in it;
therefore the unit E measures the number B the same
number of times that A measures D.
But the unit E measured the number B the same number
of times that A measures C;
therefore A measures each of the numbers C, D the same
number of times.
Therefore C is equal to D.
Q. E. D.

•». The numbers so produced. T h e Greek has oi ycvb/utot ii avTuni, " the (numbers)
produced from them." B y "from t h e m " Euclid means "from the original numbers," though
this is not very clear even in the Greek.
I think ambiguity is best avoided by leaving out
the words.
This proposition proves that, if any numbers be multiplied together, the order
of multiplication is indifferent, or ab = ba.
It is important to get a clear understanding of what Euclid means when
he speaks of one number multiplying another, v u . Def. 15 states that the
effect of "a multiplying b" is taking a times b. W e shall always represent
"a times b" by ab and "b times a" by ba. This being premised, the proof
that ab = ba may be represented as follows in the language of proportions.
