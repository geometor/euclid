By v n . Def. 20,
Therefore, alternately,
Again, by v n . Def. 20,
Therefore

1 : a = b : ab.
1 : b = a : ab.
1 : b = a : ba.
a : ab = a : ba,

[VII. 13]

or
ab = ba.
Euclid does not use the language of proportions but that of fractions or
their equivalent measures, quoting v n . 1 5 , a particular case of v n . 13
differently expressed, instead of v n . 13 itself.
PROPOSITION

17.

If a number by multiplying two numbers make certain
numbers, the numbers so produced will have the same ratio
as the numbers multiplied.
For let the number A by multiplying the two numbers B,
C make D, E;
I say that, as B is to C, so is D to E.
For, since A by multiplying B has made D,
therefore B measures D according to the units in A.

—F

But the unit F also measures the number A according to
the units in it;
therefore the unit F measures the number A the same number
of times that B measures D.
Therefore, as the unit F is to the number A, so is B to D.
[vn. Def. 20]
For the same reason,
as the unit F is to the number A, so also is C to E;
therefore also, as B is to D, so is C to E.
Therefore, alternately, as B is to C, so is D to E. [vn. 13]
Q. E. D.

b : c=ab

: ac.

In this case Euclid translates the language of measures into that of
proportions, and the proof is exactly like that set out in the last note.
By vn. Def. 20,
1 : a = b : ab,
and
1 : a = c : ac.
Therefore
b : ab = c : ac,
and, alternately,
b: c = ab : ac.
