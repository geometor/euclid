If two numbers by multiplying any number make certain
numbers, the numbers so produced will have the same ratio as
the multipliers.
For let two numbers A, B by multiplying any number C
make D, £;
I say that, as A is to B, so is D

to 2?.

D

For, since .<4 by multiplying
C has made D,
therefore also C by multiplying A has made / ? .
[vn. 16]
For the same reason also
C by multiplying B has made E.
Therefore the number C by muk.plying the two numbers
A, B has made D, E.
Therefore, as A is to B, sa is D to E.
[vn. 17]
It is here proved that
a :b = ac :bc.
T h e argument is as follows.

[vn. 16]

ac = ca.

Similarly
And
therefore

be = cb.

[vn. 17]

a : b = ca : cb;

a : b -- ac : be.

PROPOSITION

19.

If four numbers be proportional, the number produced from
the first and fourth will be equal to the number produced from
the second and third; and, if the number produced from the
first and fourth be equal to that produced from the second and
third, the four numbers will be proportional.
Let A, B, C, D be four numbers in proportion, so that,
as A is to B, so is C to D;
and let A by multiplying D make E, and let B by multiply­
ing C make F;
I say that E is equal to F.
For let A by multiplying C make G.
