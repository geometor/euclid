Since, then, A by multiplying C has made G, and by
multiplying D has made E,
the number A by multiplying the two
numbers C, D has made G, E.
Therefore, as C is to D, so is G to E.
[vn. 17]

But, as C is to D, so is A to B;
therefore also, as ^4 is to B, so is 6"
to E.
Again, since A by multiplying C
has made G,
but, further, 2? has also by multiplying
C made E,
the two numbers ^4, B by multiplying a certain number C
have made C7, F.
Therefore, as A is to B, so is £ to E.
[vn. 18]
But further, as A is to B, so is C to E also;
therefore also, as G is to Zf, so is G to
Therefore G has to each of the numbers E, F the same
ratio;
therefore E is equal to F.
[cf. v. 9]
Again, let E be equal to F;
I say that, as A is to B, so is C to Z>.
For, with the same construction,
since E is equal to F,
[cf. v. 7]
therefore, as G is to E, so is G to F.
[vn. 17]
But, as £ is to E, so is C to Z>,
[vn. 18]
and, as (7 is to F, so is A to Z?.
Therefore also, as A is to i?, so is C to Z>.
Q. E. D.

If

a : b = c : d,
then

ad= be; and conversely.

T h e proof is equivalent to the following.
(1)

ac:ad=c:d

[vn. 17]

= a : b.
But
Therefore
or

a:b

= ac:bc.

ac : ad=ac
ad = be.

: be,
