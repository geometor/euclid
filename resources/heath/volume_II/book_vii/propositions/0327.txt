Now, since the numbers CG, GD are equal to one another,
and the numbers EH, HF are also equal to one another,
while the multitude of CG, GD is equal to the multitude of
EH, HF,
therefore, as CG is to EH, so is GD to HF.
Therefore also, as one of the antecedents is to one of
the consequents, so will all the antecedents be to all the
consequents.
[vn. 12]
Therefore, as CG is to EH, so is CD to EF.
Therefore CG, EH are in the same ratio with CD, EF,
being less than they :
which is impossible, for by hypothesis CD, EF are the least
numbers of those which have the same ratio with them.
Therefore CD is not parts of A ;
therefore it is a part of it.
[vn. 4]
And EF is the same part of B that CD is of A ;
[vn. 13 and Def. 20]

therefore CD measures A the same number of times that EF
measures B.
Q. E. D.

If a, b are the least numbers among those which have the same ratio
(i.e. if a/b is a fraction in its lowest terms), and c, d are any others in the same
ratio,.i.e. if
a : b = c : d,

then a = - c and b = - d, where « is some integer.

T h e proof is by reductio ad absurdum, thus.
[Since a <c, a is some proper fraction ( " p a r t " or " p a r t s " ) of c, by v n . 4.]
Now a cannot be equal to — c, where m is an integer less than n but
n

greater than 1.
For, if a = -c,

b=-dalso.

But — a and ^ b are respectively less than a, b and they are in the same
ratio: which contradicts the hypothesis.
