Hence a can only be " a part" of c, or
a is of the form - c,
n

and therefore

b is of the form - d.
n

Here also Heiberg omits a proposition which was no doubt interpolated
by T h e o n ( B , V , p, <f> have it as v n . 22, but P only has it in the margin
and in a later h a n d ; Campanus also omits it) proving for numbers the ex
aequali proposition when " the proportion is perturbed," i.e. (cf. enunciation
of v. 22) if
a:b = e:f,
(1)
and
b : c = d : e,
(2)
then
a : c = d :/.
T h e proof (see Heiberg's Appendix) depends on VII. 19.
From ( 1 ) we have
a / = be,
and from (2)
be = cd.
[vn. 19]
Therefore
o / = cd,
and accordingly
a : c-d :f.
[ v n . 19]

PROPOSITION 

2 1 .

Numbers prime to one another are the least of those which
have the same ratio with them.
Let A, B be numbers prime to one another;
I say that A, B are the least of
those which have the same ratio
with them.

For, if not, there will be some

numbers less than A, B which are
in the same ratio with A, B.
Let them be C, D.
Since, then, the least numbers of those which have the
same ratio measure those which have the same ratio the
same number of times, the greater the greater and the less
the less, that is, the antecedent the antecedent and the
consequent the consequent,
[vn. 20]
therefore C measures A the same number of times that D
measures B.
Now, as many times as C measures A, so many units let
there be in E.
Therefore D also measures B according to the units in E.
