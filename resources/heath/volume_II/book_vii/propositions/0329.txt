And, since C measures A according to the units in E,
therefore E also measures A according to the units in C.
[vn. 16]

For the same reason
E also measures B according to the units in D.
[vn. 16]
Therefore E measures A, B which are prime to one
another : which is impossible.
[vn. Def. 12]
Therefore there will be no numbers less than A, B which
are in the same ratio with A, B.
Therefore A, B are the least of those which have the same
ratio with them.
Q. E. D.

In other words, if a, b are prime to one another, the ratio a : b is " in its
lowest terms."
T h e proof is equivalent to the following.
If not, suppose that c, d are the least numbers for which
a : b = c : d.
[Euclid only supposes some numbers c, d in the ratio of a to b such that
c <a, and (consequently) d < b. It j s however necessary to suppose that
c, d are the least numbers in that ratio in order to enable v n . 20 to be
used in the proof.]
Then [vn. 20] a = me, and b = md, where m is some integer.
Therefore
a = em, b = dm,
[vu. 16]
and m is a common measure of a, b, though these are prime to one another
which is impossible.
[vn. Def. 12
Thus the least numbers in the ratio of a to b cannot be less than a,
thetnselves.
Where I have quoted v n . 16 Heiberg regards the reference as being to
v n . s 5. I think the phraseology of the text combined with that of Def. 15
suggests the former rather than the latter.

PROPOSITION

22.

The least numbers of those which have the same ratio with
them are prime to one another.
Let A, B be the least numbers of those which have the
same ratio with them;
I say that A, B are prime to one
another.
B

Q

For, if they are not prime to one
another, some number will measure
them.
Let some number measure them, and let it be C.
