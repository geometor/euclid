And, as many times as C measures A, so many units
let there be in D,
and, as many times as C measures B, so many units let there
be in E
Since C measures A according to the units in D,
therefore C by multiplying D has made A.
[vn. Def. 15]
For the same reason also
C by multiplying E has made B.
T h u s the number C by multiplying the two numbers D,
E has made A, B ;
therefore, as D is to E, so is A to B;
[vn. 17]
therefore D, E are in the same ratio with A, B, being less
than they : which is impossible.
Therefore no number will measure the numbers A, B.
Therefore A, B are prime to one another.

If a j 44* "
its lowest terms," a, b are prime to one another.
Again the proof is indirect.
If a, b are not prime to one another, they have some common measure c,
and
a = mc, b = nc.
Therefore
m : n = a : b.
[ v n . 17 or 18]
But m, n are less than a, b respectively, so that a : b is not in its lowest
terms: which is contrary to the hypothesis.
Therefore etc.

PROPOSITION

23.

If two numbers be prime to one another, the number which
measures the one of them will be prime to the remaining
number.
Let A, B be two numbers prime to one another, and let
any number C measure A ;
I say that C, B are also prime to one another.
For, if C, B are not prime to one another,
some number will measure C, B.
Let a number measure them, and let it be D.
Since D measures C, and C measures .4,
therefore D also measures A.
But it also measures B;
A
