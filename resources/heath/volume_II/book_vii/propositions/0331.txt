therefore D measures A, B which are prime to one another:
which is impossible.
[vn. Def. 12]
Therefore no number will measure the numbers C, B.
Therefore C, B are prime to one another.
Q. E. D.

If a, mb are prime to one another, b is prime to a. For, if not, some
number d will measure both a and b, and therefore both a and mb: which is
contrary to the hypothesis.
Therefore etc.
PROPOSITION

24.

If two numbers be prime to any number, their product also
will be prime to the same.
For let the two numbers A, B be prime to any number C,
and let A by multiplying B make D ;
I say that C, D are prime to one another.
For, if C, D are not prime to one another,
some number will measure C, D.
Let a number measure them, and let it
be E.
Now, since C, A are prime to one
another,
and a certain number E measures C,
therefore A, E are prime to one another.
[vn. 23]
A s many times, then, as E measures D, so many units let
there be in F;
therefore F also measures D according to the units in E.
[vn. 16]

Therefore E by multiplying F has made D.
[vn. Def. 15]
But, further, A by multiplying B has also made D ;
therefore the product of E, F is equal to the product of A, B.
But, if the product of the extremes be equal to that of the
means, the four numbers are proportional;
[vn. 19]
therefore, as E is to A, so is B to F,
But A, E are prime to one another,
numbers which are prime to one another are also the least of
those which have the same ratio,
[vn. 21]
and the least numbers of those which have the same ratio
with them measure those which have the same ratio the same
