number of times, the greater the greater and the less the less,
that is, the antecedent the antecedent and the consequent the
consequent;
[vn. 20]
therefore E measures B.
But it also measures C;
therefore E measures B, C which are prime to one another:
which is impossible.
[vn. Def. 12]
Therefore no number will measure the numbers C, D.
Therefore C, D are prime to one another.
Q. E. D.

1. their product. 6 $ airQy yct>6nevot, literally " the (number) produced from them,"
will henceforth be translated as " their product."
If a, b are both prime to c, then ab, c are prime to one another.
T h e proof is again by reductio ad absurdum.
If ab, c are not prime to one another, let them be measured by a and be
equal to md, nd, say, respectively.
Now, since a, c are prime to one another and d measures c,
a, d are prime to one another.
[vn. 23]
But, since
ab = md,
d : a = b : m.
[vn. 19]
Therefore [vn. 20]
d measures b,
or
b = pd, say.
But
c = nd.
Therefore d measures both b and c, which are therefore not prime to one
another: which is impossible.
Therefore etc.
PROPOSITION

25.

If two numbers be prime to one another, the product of one
of them into itself will be prime to the remaining one.
Let A, B be two numbers prime to one another,
and let A by multiplying itself make C:
I say that B, C are prime to one another.
For let D be made equal to A.
Since A, B are prime to one another,
and A is equal to D,
therefore D, B are also prime to one another.
Therefore each of the two numbers D, A is
prime to B;
therefore the product of D, A will also be prime to B. [vn. 24]
