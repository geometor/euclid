literally " t h e number produced from the one of them," leaves "multiplied into itself" to be
understood.

i f a, b are prime to one another,
a is prime to b.
Euclid takes d equal to a, so that d, a are both prime to b.
Hence, by v n . 24, da, i.e. a , is prime to b.
T h e proposition is a particular case of the preceding proposition; and the
method of proof is by substitution of different numbers in the result of that

PROPOSITION

26.

If two numbers be prime to two numbers, both to each, their
products also will be prime to one another.
For let the two numbers A, B be prime to the two
numbers C, D; both to each,
and let A by multiplying B
make E, and let C by multiplying D make F;
I say that E, F are prime to
one another.
For, since each of the numbers A, B is prime to C,
therefore the product of A, B will also be prime to C. [vn. 24]
But the product of A, B is E ;
therefore E, C are prime to one another.
For the same reason
E, D are also prime to one another.
Therefore each of the numbers C, D is prime to E.
Therefore the product of C, D will also be prime to E.
[vn. 24]
But the product of C, D is F.
Therefore E, F are prime to one another.

If both a and b are prime to each of two numhers c, d, then ab, cd will be
prime to one another.
Since a, b are both prime to c,
ab, c are prime to one another.
[vn. 24]
Similarly
ab, d are prime to one another.
Therefore
c. d are both prime to ab,
and so therefore is cd.
