PROPOSITION

27.

If two numbers be prime to one another, and each by
multiplying itself make a certain number, the products will be
prime to one another; and, if the original numbers by multi­
plying the products make certain numbers, the latter will also
be prime to one another [and this is always the case with the
extremes].
Let A, B be. two numbers prime to one another,
let A by multiplying itself make C, and by
multiplying C make D,
and let B by multiplying itself make E, and
by multiplying E make F;
I say that both C, E and D, F are prime
to one another.
For, since A, B are prime to one another,
and A by multiplying itself has made C,
therefore C, B are prime to one another.
[vn. 25]
Since then C, B are prime to one another,
and B by multiplying itself has made E,
therefore C, E are prime to one another.
[id.]
Again, since A, B are prime to one another,
and B by multiplying itself has made E,
therefore A, E are prime to one another.
[id.]
Since then the two numbers A, C are prime to the two
numbers B, E, both to each,
therefore also the product of A, C is prime to the product of
B, E.
[vn. 26]
A n d the product of A, C is D, and the product of B, E
isF.
Therefore D, F are prime to one another.
Q. E. D.

If a, b are prime to one another, so are a\ b and so are d*, b ; and,
generally, a", b are prime to one another.
T h e words in the enunciation which assert the truth of the proposition for
any powers are suspected and bracketed by Heiberg because (i) in wipi T O W
aKpovs the use of axpoi is peculiar, for it can only mean " the last products,"
and (2) the words have nothing corresponding to them in the proof, much
less is the generalisation proved. Campanus omits the words in the enuncian
