tion, though he adds to the proof a remark that the proposition is true of any,
the same or different, powers of a, b. Heiberg concludes that the words are
an interpolation of date earlier than Theon.
Euclid's proof amounts to this.
Since a, b are prime to one another, so are a , b [ v n . 25I, and therefore
also a", b>.
[vn. 25]
Similarly [vn. 25] a, b* are prime to one another.
Therefore a, a' and b, V satisfy the description in the enunciation of
v n . 26.
Hence a , b are prime to one another.

PROPOSITION

28.

If two numbers be prime to one another, the sum will also
be prime to each of them ; and, if the sum of two numbers be
prime to any one of them, the original numbers will also be
prime to one another.
For let two numbers AB, BC prime to one another be
added;
I say that the sum AC is also prime
A
B
O
to each of the numbers AB, BC.
0

For, if CA, AB are not prime to
one another,
some number will measure CA, AB.
Let a number measure them, and let it be D.
Since then D measures CA, AB,
therefore it will also measure the remainder BC.
But it also measures BA ;
therefore D measures AB, BC which are prime to one another:
which is impossible.
[vn. Def. 12]
Therefore no number will measure the numbers CA, AB;
therefore CA, AB are prime to one another.
For the same reason
AC, CB are also prime to one another.
Therefore CA is prime to each of the numbers AB, BC.
Again, let CA, AB be prime to one another;
I say that AB, BC are also prime to one another.
For, if AB, BC are not prime to one another,
some number will measure AB, BC.
