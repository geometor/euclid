Let a number measure them, and let it be D.
Now, since D measures each of the numbers AB, BC, it
will also measure the whole CA.
But it also measures AB ;
therefore D measures CA, AB which are prime to one another:
which is impossible.
[vu. Def. 12]
Therefore no number will measure the numbers AB, BC.
Therefore AB, BC are prime to one another.
Q. E. D.
If a, b are prime to one another, a + b will be prime to both a and b; and
conversely.
For suppose (a + b), a are not prime to one another. T h e y must then
have some common measure d.
Therefore d also divides the difference (a + b) - a, or b, as well as a; and
therefore a, b are not prime to one another: which is contrary to the
hypothesis.
Therefore
a + b is prime to a.
Similarly
a + b is prime to b.
T h e converse is proved in the same way.
Heiberg remarks on Euclid's assumption that, if c measures both a and b,
it also measures a ± b. But it has already ( v n . I, 2) been assumed, more
generally, as an axiom that, in the case supposed, c measures a ±pb.

not measure.

PROPOSITION

29.

Let A be a prime number, and let it not measure B;
I say that B, A are prime to one another.
A
For, if B, A are not prime to one
another,
B
some number will measure them.
c
Let C measure them.
Since C measures B,
and A does not measure B,
therefore C is not the same with A.
Now, since C measures B, A,
therefore it also measures A which is prime, though it is not
the same with i t :
which is impossible.
