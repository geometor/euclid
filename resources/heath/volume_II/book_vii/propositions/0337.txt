Therefore no number will measure B, A.
Therefore A, B are prime to one another.
Q. E. D.
If a is prime and does not measure b, then a, b are prime to one another.
T h e proof is self-evident.

PROPOSITION

30.

If tivo numbers by multiplying one another make some
number, and any prime number measure the product, tt ivill
also measure one of the original numbers.
For let the two numbers A, B by multiplying one another
make C, and let any prime number
D measure C ;
I say that D measures one of the
numbers A, B.
c
For let it not measure A.
Now D is prime ;
E
therefore A, D are prime to one
another.
[vn. 29]
And, as many times as D measures C, so many units let
there be in E.
Since then D measures C according to the units in E,
therefore D by multiplying E has made C.
[vn. Def. 15]
Further, A by multiplying B has also made C;
therefore the product of D, E is equal to the product of
A, B.
Therefore, as D is to A, so is B to E.
[VM. 19]
But D, A are prime to one another,
primes are also least,
[vn. 21]
and the least measure the numbers which have the same
ratio the same number of times, the greater the greater and
the less the less, that is, the antecedent the antecedent and
the consequent the consequent;
[vn. 20]
therefore D measures B.
Similarly we can also show that, if D do not measure B,
it will measure A.
Therefore D measures one of the numbers A, B.
