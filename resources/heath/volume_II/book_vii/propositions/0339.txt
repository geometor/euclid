A.

18. some prime number will be found which will measure. I n the G r e e k the
sentence stops here, but it is necessary to add the words " the number before it, which will
also measure A" which are found a few lines further down. It is possible that the words
may have fallen out of P here b y a simple mistake due to SfjLoioriXevrov (Heiberg).

Heiberg relegates to the Appendix an alternative proof of this proposition,
to the following effect. Since A is composite, some number will measure it.
Let B be the least such number. I say that B is prime. For, if not, B is
composite, and some number will measure it, say C; so that C is less than B.
But, since C measures B, and B measures A, C must measure A. A n d C is
less than B: which is contrary to the hypothesis.

PROPOSITION

32.

Any number either is prime or is measured by some prime
number.
Let A be & number;
I say that A either is prime or is measured by some prime
number.
If now A is prime, that which was
A
enjoined will have been done.
But if it is composite, some prime number will measure it.
[vn- 3 1 ]

Therefore any number either is prime or is measured by
some prime number.

PROPOSITION

33.

Given as many numbers as we please, to find the least of
those which have the same ratio with them.
Let A, B, C be the given numbers, as many as we please;
thus it is required to find the least of
5 those which have the same ratio with
A, B, C.
A, B, C are either prime to one
another or not.
Now, if A, B, C are prime to one I
10 another, they are the least of those
H.
which have the same ratio with them.

But, if not, let D the greatest common measure of A, B, C
be taken,
