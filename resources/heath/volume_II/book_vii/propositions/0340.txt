and, as many times as D measures the numbers A, B, C
is respectively, so many units let there be in the numbers
E, F, G respectively.
Therefore the numbers E, E, G measure the numbers A,
B, C respectively according to the units in D.
[vn. 16]
Therefore E, E, G measure A, B, C the same number of
20 times;
therefore E, E, G are in the same ratio with A, B, C.
[vn. Def. 20]
I say next that they are the least that are in that ratio.
For, if E, F, G are not the least of those which have the
same ratio with A, B, C,
25 there will be numbers less than E, F, G which are in the
same ratio with A, B, C.
Let them be H, K, L ;
therefore H measures A the same number of times that the
numbers K, L measure the numbers B, C respectively.

Now, as many times as H measures A, so many units let
there be in M;
therefore the numbers K, L also measure the numbers B, C
respectively according to the units in M.
And, since H measures A according to the units in M,
35 therefore M also measures A according to the units in H.
[vn. 16]
F o r the same reason
M also measures the numbers B, C according to the units in
the numbers K, L respectively ;
Therefore M measures A, B, C.
40
Now, since H measures A according to the units in M,
therefore H by multiplying M has made A.
[vn. Def. 15]
For the same reason also
E by multiplying D has made A.
Therefore the product of E, D is equal to the product of
M.
Therefore, as E is to H, so is M to D.
[vn. 19]
But E is greater than H;
therefore M is also greater than D.
And it measures A, B, C:
