5° which is impossible, for by hypothesis D is the greatest
common measure of A, B, C.
Therefore there cannot be any numbers less than E, E, G
which are in the same ratio with A, B, C.
Therefore E, F, G are the least of those which have the
55 same ratio with A, B, C.

Q. E. D.

the n u m b e r s A , B , C respectively,
F, G measures each of the numbers A,

Given any numbers a, b, c,
to find the least numbers that are in the
same ratio.
Euclid's method is the obvious one, and the result is verified by reductio
ad

absurdum.

We will, like Euclid, take three numbers only, a, b, c.
Let g, their greatest common measure, be found [vn. 3], and suppose that
a = mg, i.e. gm,
[ v u . 16]
b = ng, i.e. gn,
It follows, by v n . Def. 20, that
m : n \ p = a : b : c.

m, ft, p shall be the numbers required.
For, if not, let x, y, z be the least numbers in the same ratio as a, b, c,
being less than m, tt, p.
Therefore
a = kx (or xk, VII. 16),
b = ky (or yk),
c = kz (or zk),
where k is some integer.
[ v n . 20]
Thus
mg = a = xk.
Therefore

m:x = k:g.

[ v n . 19]

And m > x; therefore k > g.
Since then k measures a, b, e, it follows that g is not the greatest common
measure: which contradicts the hypothesis.
Therefore etc.
It is to be observed that Euclid merely supposes that x, y, z are smaller
numbers than m, n, p in the ratio of a, b, c; but, in order to justify the next
inference, which apparently can only depend on v n . 20, x, y, z must also be
assumed to be the least numbers in the ratio of a, b, c.
T h e inference from the last proportion that, since m > x, k>gis
supposed
by Heiberg to depend upon v n . 13 and v. 14 together. I prefer to regard
Euclid as making the inference quite independently of Book v. E.g., the
proportion could just as well be written
x : m=g

: k,

when the definition of proportion in Book VII. (Def. 20) gives all that we want,
since, whatever proper fraction x is of m, the same proper fraction is g of k.
