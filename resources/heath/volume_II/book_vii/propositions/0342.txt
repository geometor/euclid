PROPOSITION

34.

Given two numbers, to find the least number which they
measure.
Let A, B be the two given numbers ;
thus it is required to find the least number which they
measure.
Now A, B are either prime to one
another or not.
First, let A, B be prime to one
another, and let A by multiplying B
make C;
therefore also B by multiplying A has
made C.
^
[vn. 16]
Therefore A, B measure C
I say next that it is also the least number they measure.
For, if not, A, B will measure some number which is less
than C.
Let them measure D.
Then, as many times as si measures D, so many units let
there be in E,
and, as many times as B measures D, so many units let there
be in F\
therefore A by multiplying E has made D,
and B by multiplying F has made D ;
[vn. Def. 15]
therefore the product of A, E is equal to the product of B, F.
Therefore, as A is to B, so is F x.o E.
[vu. 19]
But A, B are prime,
primes are also least,
[vn. 21]
and the least measure the numbers which have the same ratio
the same number of times, the greater the greater and the less
the less ;
[vn. 20]
therefore B measures E, as consequent consequent.
And, since A by multiplying B, E has made C, D,
therefore, as B is to E, so is C to D.
[vu. 17]
But B measures E;
therefore C also measures D, the greater the less :
which is impossible.
