Therefore A, B do not measure any number less than C;
therefore C is the least that is measured by A, B.
Next, let A, B no* be prime to one another,
and let F, E, the least numbers of those which have the same
ratio with A, B, be taken ;
[vu. 33]
therefore the product of A, E is equal to the product of B, F.
[vu. 19]
And let A by multiplying E
make C;
§
therefore also B by multiplying F
g
has made C,
,
therefore A, B measure C.
o
I say next that it is also the least
Q
H
number that they measure.
For, if not, A, B will measure some number which is less
than C.
Let them measure D.
And, as many times as A measures D, so many units let
there be in G,
and, as many times as B measures D, so many units let there
be in H.
Therefore A by multiplying G has made D,
and B by multiplying H has made D.
Therefore the product of A, G is equal to the product of
B,H\
therefore, as A is to B, so is H to G.
[vn. 19]
But, as A is to B, so is F to E.
Therefore also, as F is to E, so is H to G.
But F, E are least,
and the least measure the numbers which have the same ratio
the same number of times, the greater the greater and the
less the less ;
[vn. 20]
therefore E measures G.
And, since A by multiplying E, G has made C, D,
therefore, as E is to G, so is C to D.
[vn. 17]
But E measures G ;
therefore C also measures D, the greater the less :
which is impossible.
