Therefore A, B will not measure any number which is less
than C.
Therefore C is the least that is measured by A, B.
Q.

D.

This is the problem of finding the least common multiple of two numbers,
as a, b.
I.

If a, b be prime to one another, the L . C . M . is ab.

For, if not, let it be d, some number less than ab.
Then

d=ma

Therefore

= nb, where m, n are integers.
a : b = n : m,

[vu. 19]

and hence, a, b being prime to one another,

But

b measures m.

[ v n . 20, 21]

b : m = ab : am

[vn. 17]

=

ab:d.

Therefore ab measures d: which is impossible.
I I . If a, b be not prime to one another, find the numbers which are the
least of those having the ratio of a to b, say m, n;
[vn. 33]
then

a : b = m : n,
and

an = bm (=<r,say);

[vn. 19]

c is then the L.CM.
For, if not, let it be d

c), so that

ap = bq = d, where / , q are integers.
Then

a : b = q : p,

whence

m : n = q : p,

so that

n measures / .

And

n : p = an : ap = c : d,

so that

c measures d:

which is impossible.
Therefore etc.
B y v u . 33,

m= b
n = g-

Hence the L.C.M. is — .
g

, where g is the G.C.M. of a, b.
