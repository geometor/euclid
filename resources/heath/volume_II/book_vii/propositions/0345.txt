If two numbers measure any number, the least number
measured by them will also measure the same.
For let the two numbers A, B measure any number CD,
and let E be the least that they
measure;
I say that E also measures CD.
For, if E does not measure
CD, let E, measuring DE, leave CF less than itself.
Now, since A, B measure E,
and E measures DF,
therefore A, B will also measure DF.
But they also measure the whole CD ;
therefore they will also measure the remainder CF which is
less than E:
which is impossible.
Therefore E cannot fail to measure CD ;
therefore it measures it.

Q. E. D.
T h e least common multiple of any two numbers must measure any other
common multiple.
T h e proof is obvious, depending on the fact that, if any number divides a
and b, it also divides a -pb.

Given three numbers, to find the least number which they
measure.
Let A, B, C be the three given numbers ;
thus it is required to find the least
number which they measure.

Let D, the least number meaB

be taken.

Then C either measures, or
E
does not measure, D.
