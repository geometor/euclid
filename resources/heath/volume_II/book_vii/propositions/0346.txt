But A, B also measure D ;
therefore A, B, C measure D.
I say next that it is also the least that they measure.
For, if not, A, B, C will measure some number which is
less than D.
Let them measure E.
Since A, B, C measure E,
therefore also A, B measure E.
Therefore the least number measured by A, B will also
measure E.
[vn. 35]
But D is the least number measured by A, B;
therefore D will measure E, the greater the less :
which is impossible.
Therefore A, B, C will not measure any number which is
less than D;
therefore D is the least that A, B, C measure.
Again, let C not measure D,
and let E, the least number measured by
.
C, D, be taken.
[vn. 34]
Since A, B measure D,
and D measures E,
0
therefore also A, B measure E.
E
But C also measures E;
therefore also A, B, C measure E.
I say next that it is also the least that they measure.
For, if not, A, B, C will measure some number which
is less than E.
Let them measure F.
Since A, B, C measure F,
therefore also A, B measure F;
therefore the least number measured by A, B will also
measure F.
[vn. 35]
But D is the least number measured by A*B;
therefore D measures F.
But C also measures F;
therefore D, C measure F,
so that the least number measured by D, C will also measure F.
