But E is the least number measured by C, D;
therefore E measures F, the greater the less :
which is impossible.
Therefore A, B, C will not measure any number which is
less than E.
Therefore E is the least that is measured by A, B, C.

Euclid's rule for finding the L.CM. of three numbers a, b, c is the rule with
which we are familiar. T h e U C H . of a, b is first found, say d, and then the
L.C.M. of d and c is found.
Euclid distinguishes the cases (1) in which c measures d, (2) in which c
does not measure d. W e need only reproduce the proof of the general case
(2).
T h e method is that of reductio ad absurdum.
Let e be the L.C.M. of d, e.
Since a, b both measure d, a n d d measures e,
a, b both measure e.
So does c.
Therefore e is some common multiple of a, b, c.
If it is not the least, let / b e the L.CM.
Now a, b both m e a s u r e / ;
therefore d, their L.C.M., also measures f.
[vu. 35]
Thus d, c both measure / ;
therefore e, their L.CM., m e a s u r e s / :
[vu. 35]
which is impossible, since / < e.
Therefore etc.
The process can be continued ad libitum, so that we can find the L.C.M.,
not only of three, but of as many numbers as we please.

PROPOSITION

37.

If a number be measured by any number, the number which
is measured will have a part called by the same name as the
measuring number.
For let the number A be measured by any number B;
I say that A has a part called by the same
name as B.
A
For, as many times as B measures A,
so many units let there be in C.
Since B measures A according to the
units in C,
and the unit D also measures the number C according to the
units in it,
B
