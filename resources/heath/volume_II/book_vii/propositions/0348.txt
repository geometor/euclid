therefore the unit D measures the number C the same number
of times as B measures A.
Therefore, alternately, the unit D measures the number B
the same number of times as C measures A ;
[vn. 15]
therefore, whatever part the unit D is of the number B, the
same part is C of A also.
But the unit D is a part of the number B called by the
same name as it;
therefore C is also a part of A called by the same name as B,
so that A has a part C which is called by the same name as B.

D.

measures a, then j th of a is a whole number.
Let
a = m. b.
Now
m = m . 1.
T h u s i, m, b, a satisfy the enunciation of v u . 15 ;
therefore m measures a the same number of times that 1 measures b.
But

1 is \ th part of b;

therefore

m is T th part of a.

PROPOSITION

38.

If a number have any part whatever, it will be measured
by a number called by the same name as the part.
F o r let the number A have any part whatever, B,
and let C be a number called by the same
name as the part B ;
I say that C measures A.
~
For, since B is a part of A called by
the same name as C,
and the unit D is also a part of C called
by the same name as it,
therefore, whatever part the unit D is of the number C,
the same part is B of A also ;
therefore the unit D measures the number C the same number
of times that B measures A.
