Therefore, alternately, the unit D measures the number B
the same number of times that C measures A.
[vn. 15]
Therefore C measures A.
Q. E. D.
This proposition is practically a restatement of the preceding propositionIt asserts that, if b is — th part of a,
m

i.e.,if

b=-a,
m

then
We have
and

m measures a.
b=

-a,

1 = — m.
m

Therefore 1, m, b, a, satisfy the enunciation of v u . 1 5 , and therefore m
measures a the same number of times as 1 measures b, or
1
m =

- a.
b

PROPOSITION

39.

To find the number which is the least that will have given
parts.
Let A, B, C be the given parts ;
thus it is required to find the number which is the least thai
will have the parts A, B, C.
A
1
c
o

Let D, E, F be numbers called by the same name as the
parts A, B, C,
and let G, the least number measured by D, E, F, be taken.
[vn. 36]

Therefore G has parts called by the same name as D, E, F.
[vn. 37]

But A, B, C are parts called by the same name as D, E, F;
therefore G has the parts A, B, C.
I say next that it is also the least number that has.
