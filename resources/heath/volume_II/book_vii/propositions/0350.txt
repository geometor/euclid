For, if not, there will be some number less than G which
will have the parts A, B, C.
Let it be H.
Since H has the parts A, B, C,
therefore H will be measured by numbers called by the same
name as the parts A, B, C.
Tvn. 38]
But D, E, F are numbers called by the same name as the
parts A, B, C;
therefore H is measured by D, E, F.
And it is less than G: which is impossible.
Therefore there will be no number less than G that will
have the parts A, B, C.
Q. E. D.

This again is practically a restatement in another form of the problem of
finding the L . C M .
T o find a number which has - th,

T

th and - th parts.

Let d be the L . C M . of a, b, c.
T h u s d has ^ t h , | t h and ^ t h parts.

[vn. 37]

If it is not the least number which has, let the least such number be e.
T h e n , since e has those parts,
e is measured by a, b, c; and e < d:
which is impossible.
