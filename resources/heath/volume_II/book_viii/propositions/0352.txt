Therefore A measures E, the greater the less :
which is impossible.
Therefore E, F, G, H which are less than A, B, C, D
are not in the same ratio with them.
Therefore A, B, C, D are the least of those which have
the same ratio with them.
Q. E. D.

What we call a geometrical progression is with Euclid a series of terms "in
continued proportion" («£js dvaKoyov).
This proposition proves that, if a, b, c, ... k are a series of numbers in
geometrical progression, and if a, k are prime to one another, the series is in
the lowest terms possible with the same common ratio.
T h e proof is in form by reductio ad absurdum.
W e should no doubt
desert this form while retaining the substance. If a', b', c , ... k' be any other
series of numbers in G.P. with the same common ratio as before, we have,
ex aequali,
a : k = a' : k',
[vn. 14]
whence, since a, k are prime to one another, a, k measure a', k respectively, so
that a, k are greater than a, k respectively.

PROPOSITION

2.

To find numbers in continued proportion, as many as may
be prescribed, and the least that are in a given ratio.
Let the ratio of A to B be the given ratio in least
numbers;
thus it is required to find numbers in continued proportion,
as many as may be prescribed, and the least that are in the
ratio of A to B.

Let four be prescribed ;
let A by multiplying itself make C, and by multiplying B let
it make D;
let B by multiplying itself make E;
further, let A by multiplying C, D, E make F, G, H,
and let B by multiplying E make K.
