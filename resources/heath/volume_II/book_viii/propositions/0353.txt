Now, since A by multiplying itself has made C,
and by multiplying B has made D,
therefore, as A is to B, so is C to D.
[vn. 17]
Again, since A by multiplying B has made D,
and B by multiplying itself has made E,
therefore the numbers A, B by multiplying B have made the
numbers D, E respectively.
Therefore, as A is to B, so is D to E.
[vn. 18]
But, as A is to B, so is C to D ;
therefore also, as C is to Z>, so is D to Zf.
And, since A by multiplying C, D has made Z", (7,
therefore, as C is to D, so is Z"to £.
[vu. 17]
But, as C is to D, so was A to Z? ;
therefore also, as y4 is to B, so is Z" to G.
Again, since A by multiplying D, E has made G, H,
therefore, as D is to E, so is G to ZZ.
[vu. 17]
But, as D is to E, so is ^4 to B.
Therefore also, as A is to B, so is G to ZZ.
And, since A, B by multiplying Zf have made ZZ, K,
therefore, as A is to B, so is ZZ to A".
[vu. 18]
But, as ^ is to B, so is F to 6", and £ to ZZ.
Therefore also, as F is to G, so is G to ZZ, and H Ko K;
therefore C, D, E, and F, G, ZZ, A ' are proportional in the
ratio of A to B.
I say next that they are the least numbers that are so.
For, since A, B are the least of those which have the
same ratio with them,
and the least of those which have the same ratio are prime
to one another,
[vn. 22]
therefore A, B are prime to one another.
And the numbers A, B by multiplying themselves re­
spectively have made the numbers C, E, and by multiplying
the numbers C, E respectively have made the numbers F, K;
therefore C, E and F, K are. prime to one another respectively.
[vn. 27]

But, if there be as many numbers as we please in continued
proportion, and the extremes of them be prime to one another,
