they are the least of those which have the same ratio with
them.
[vm. 1]
Therefore C, D, E and F, G, H, K are the least of those
which have the same ratio with A, B.
Q. E. D.

POKISM. From this it is manifest that, if three numbers
in continued proportion be the least of those which have the
same ratio with them, the extremes of them are squares, and,
if four numbers, cubes.
T o find a series of numbers in geometrical progression and in the least
terms which have a given common ratio (understanding by that term the ratio
of one term to the next).

Reduce the given ratio to its lowest terms, say, a : b. (This can be done
by v n . 33.)
Then
a", a"" *, a"" * , ... a b'- , ab*-\ b"
is the required series of numbers if (« + 1) terms are required.
That this is a series of terms with the given common ratio is clear from
vn. 17, 18.
That the G.P. is in the smallest terms possible is proved thus.
a, b are prime to one another, since the ratio a : b is in its lowest terms.
[vn. 22]
Therefore a , b are prime to one another; so are a , 6* and, generally,
a", b*.
[vn. 27]
Whence the G.P. is in the smallest possible terms, by v n i . 1.
T h e Porism observes that, if there are n terms in the series, the
extremes are (n - i)th powers.

PROPOSITION 

3.

If as many numbers as we please in continued proportion
be the least of those which have the same ratio with them, the
extremes of them are prime to one another.
Let as many numbers as we please, A, B, C, D, in con­
tinued proportion be the least of those which have the same
ratio with them;
