I say that the extremes of them A, D are prime to one
another.
For let two numbers E, F, the least that are in the ratio
of A, B, C, D, be taken,
[vu. 33]
then three others G, H, K with the same property ;
and others, more by one continually,

[vm. 2]

until the multitude taken becomes equal to the multitude of
the numbers A, B, C, D.
Let them be taken, and let them be L, M, N, O.
Now, since E, F are the least of those which have the
same ratio with them, they are prime to one another, [vu. 22]
And, since the numbers E, F by multiplying themselves
respectively have made the numbers G, K, and by multiplying
the numbers G, K respectively have made the numbers L, O,
[ v m . 2, Por.]

therefore both G, A'and L, O are prime to one another,

[vu. 27]

And, since A, B, C, D are the least of those which have
the same ratio with them,
while L, M, JV, 0 are the least that are in the same ratio with
A, B, C, D,
and the multitude of the numbers A, B, C, D is equal to the
multitude of the numbers L, M, N, O,
therefore the numbers A, B, C, D are equal to the numbers
L, M, JV, O respectively ;
therefore A is equal to L, and D to O.
And L, 0 are prime to one another.
Therefore A, D are also prime to one another.

The proof consists in merely equating the given numbers to the terms of
a series found in the manner of v m . 2.
If a, b, c, ... k (n terms) be a geometrical progression in the lowest terms
having a given common ratio, the terms must respectively be of be form
a " - \ a»-% ... a?P»->, a / 3 " - , / j found by v m . 2, where a : /3 is the ratio a : b expressed in its lowest terms, so
that o, jl are prime to one another [vn. 22], and hence a"" , / J " " are prime
to one another [vu. 27].
But the two series must be the same, so that
a = a"-',
b = jS"J
