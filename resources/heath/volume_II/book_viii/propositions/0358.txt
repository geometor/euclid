But, as H is to G, so is A to B;
60 therefore also, as A is to B, so is N to (9.
For the same reason also,
as C is to D, so is 0 to
Again, since E measures M the same number of times that
F measures P,
65 therefore, as E is to F, so is M to P;
[vn. 13 and Def. 20]
therefore A C9, M, P are continuously proportional in the
ratios of A to B, of C to D, and of Z? to F.
I say next that they are also the least that are in the ratios
A :B, C:D,
E:F.
70
For, if not, there will be some numbers less than A , O,
M, P continuously proportional in the ratios A :B, C:D,
E:F.
Let them be Q, R, S, T.
Now since, as Q is to R, so is A to B.
JS while A, B arc least,
and the least numbers measure those which have the same
ratio with them the same number of times, the antecedent the
antecedent and the consequent the consequent,
[vn. 20]
therefore B measures R.
80
For the same reason C also measures R ;
therefore B, C measure R.
Therefore the least number measured by B, C will also
measure R.
[vn. 35]
But G is the least number measured by B, C;
85 therefore G measures R.
And, as G is to R, so is K to S:
[vn. 13]
therefore K also measures S.
But E also measures 5 ;
therefore E, K measure S.
90
Therefore the least number measured by E, K will also
measure 5.
[vu. 35]
But M is the least number measured by E, K;
therefore M measures S, the greater the less :
which is impossible.
95
Therefore there will not be any numbers less than A , 0,
M, P continuously proportional in the ratios of A to B, of
C to D, and of E to F;
