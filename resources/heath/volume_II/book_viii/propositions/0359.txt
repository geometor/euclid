T h i s abbreviated expression is in

the

T h e term " in continued proportion " is here not used in its proper sense,
since a geometrical progression is not meant, but a series of terms each of
which bears to the succeeding term a given, but not the same, ratio.
T h e proposition furnishes a good example of the cumbrousness of the
Greek method of dealing with non-determinate numbers. T h e proof in fact
is not easy to follow without the help of modern symbolical notation. If
this be used, the reasoning can be made clear enough.
Euclid takes three given ratios and therefore requires to find four numbers.
We will leave out the simpler particular case which he puts first, that namely
in which E accidentally measures K, the multiple of D found in the first few
lines; and we will reproduce the general case with three ratios.
Let the ratios in their lowest terms be
a : b,

e :f

c :d,

Take /,, the L.CM. of b, c, and suppose that
l = mb = nc.
x

Form the numbers

ma, mb 1, nd.
= nc I

These are in the ratios of a to b and of c to d respectively.
Next, let / be the L.CM. of nd, e, and let
a

/, = pnd = qe.

Now form the numbers
pma,

pmb \ ,
=pnc I

and these are the four numbers required.
If they are not the least in the given ratios, let

be less numbers in the given ratios.
Since a : b is in its lowest terms, and

"

a : b = x : y,

b measures y.
Similarly, since
c : d=y : z,
c measures^.
Therefore
the L.CM. of b, e, measuresy.
But

/ , : nd\=c

Therefore nd measures z.
And, since
e :f =z :u,
e measures z.
Therefore 4 , the L.CM. of nd, e, measures 2 : which is impossible, since
z < / or pnd.
T h e step (line 86) inferring that G : R = K: S is of course alternando

It will be observed that v m . 4 corresponds to the portion of v i . 23 which
shows how to compound two ratios between straight lines.
