Plane numbers have to one another the ratio compounded
of the ratios of their sides.
Let A, B be plane numbers, and let the numbers C, D
be the sides of A, and E, F oi B;
5 I say that A has to B the ratio compounded of the ratios of the sides.
For, the ratios being given which C
_
has to E and D to F, let the least
numbers G, H, A ' t h a t are continuously
10 in the ratios C: £, D : F be taken, so
that,
as C is to E, so is G to H',
and,
as D is to F, so is H to K.
[ v m . 4]
And let D by multiplying E make L.
15
Now, since D by multiplying C has made A, and by
multiplying E has made L,
therefore, as C is to E, so is A to L.
[vn. 17]
But, as C is to E, so is G to ZZ;
therefore also, as G is to ZZ, so is A to L.
20
Again, since E by multiplying Z> has made L, and further
by multiplying F has made B,
therefore, as D is to F, so is Z, to B.
[vn. 17]
But, as D is to Z", so is ZZ to AT;
therefore also, as ZZ is to K, so is L to B.
25
But it was also proved that,
as G is to ZZ, so is A to Z ;
therefore, ex aequali,
as G is to A", so is A to B.
[vn. 14]
But G has to K the ratio compounded of the ratios of the
30 sides;
therefore A also has to B the ratio compounded of the ratios
of the sides.
