If / is the L.C.M. of e, d and l=me = nd, the three numbers are
mc, me \ , nf.
[ v m . 4]
= nd j
Now
dc:de=c:e
[vn. 1 7 ]
= mc : me - mc : nd.
Also
ed : ef= d : f
[vn. 17]
= nd : nf.
Therefore, ex aequali,
cd : ef=mc : nf
= (ratio compounded of c : e and d; f).
It will be seen that this proof follows exactly the method of vi. 23 for
parallelograms.

PROPOSITION

6.

If there be as many numbers as we please in continued
proportion, and the first do not measure the second, neither
will any other measure any other.
Let there be as many numbers as we please, A, B, C, D, E,
in continued proportion, and let A not measure B;
I say that neither will any other measure any other.
A
B
C

D

E
F
G

H

Now it is manifest that A, B, C, D, E do not measure
one another in order; for A does not even measure B.
I say, then, that neither will any other measure any other.
For, if possible, let A measure C.
And, however many A, B, C are, let as many numbers
E, G, H, the least of those which have the same ratio with
A, B, C, be taken.
[vn. 33]
Now, since F, G, H are in the same ratio \ ith A, B, C,
and the multitude of the numbers A, B, C is equal to the
multitude of the numbers F, G, H,
therefore, ex aequali, as A is to C, so is F to H.
[vn. 14]
