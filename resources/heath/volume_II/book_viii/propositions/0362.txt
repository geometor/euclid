A n d since, as A is to B, so is F to G,
while A does not measure B,
therefore neither does F measure G ;
[vn. Def. 20]
therefore F is not an unit, for the unit measures any number.
N o w / , Hare prime to one another.
[vm. 3]
And, as F is to H, so is A to C;
therefore neither does A measure C.
Similarly we can prove that neither will any other measure
any other.

Q. E. D.

L e t a, b, c ... k be a geometrical progression in which a does not measure b.
Suppose, if possible, that a measures some term of the series, as /
T a k e x, y, 2, u, v, w the least numbers in the ratio a, b, c, d, e, f.
Since
x : y = a : b,
and a does not measure b,
x does not m e a s u r e ^ ; therefore x cannot be unity.
A n d , ex aequali,

x :w = a

:/.

Now x, w are prime to one another.
[ v m . 3]
Therefore a does not measure / .
We can of course prove that an intermediate term, as b, does not measure
a later term / by using the series b, c, d, e, f and remembering that, since
b : c = a : b, b does not measure c.

PROPOSITION 

7.

If there be as many numbers as we please in continued
proportion, and the first measure the last, it will measure the
second also.
Let there be as many numbers as we please, A, B, C, D,
in continued proportion; and
let A measure D ;
I say that A also measures B.
For, if A does not measure
B, neither will any other of the
numbers measure any other.
[vm. 6]
But A measures D.
Therefore A also measures B.
