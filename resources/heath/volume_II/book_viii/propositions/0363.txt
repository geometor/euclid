PROPOSITION 

8.

If between two numbers there fall numbers in continued
proportion with them, then, however many numbers fall between
them in continued proportion, so many will also fall in con­
tinued proportion between the numbers which have the same
ratio with the original numbers.
Let the numbers C, D fall between the two numbers A,
B in continued proportion with them, and let £ be made in
the same ratio to F as A is to B ;
I say that, as many numbers as have fallen between A, B in
continued proportion, so many will also fall between E, F in
continued proportion.

For, as many as A, B, C, D are in multitude, let so many
numbers G, H, K, L, the least of those which have the same
ratio with A, C, D, B, be taken ;
[vn. 33]
therefore the extremes of them G L are prime to one another.

Now, since A, C, D, B are in the same ratio with G, H,
K, L,
and the multitude of the numbers A, C, D, B is equal to the
multitude of the numbers G, H, K, L,
therefore, ex aequali, as A is to B, so is G to L.
[vn. 14]
But, as A is to B, so is £ to F;
therefore also, as G is to L, so is E to F.
But G, L are prime,
primes are also least,
[vn. 2 1 ]
and the least numbers measure those which have the same
ratio the same number of times, the greater the greater and
the less the less, that is, the antecedent the antecedent and the
consequent the consequent.
