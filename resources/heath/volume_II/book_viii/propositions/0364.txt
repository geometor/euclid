Therefore G measures E the same number of times as L
measures F.
Next, as many times as G measures E, so many times let
H, K also measure M, N respectively ;
therefore G, H, K, L measure E, M, N, F the same number
of times.
Therefore G, H, K, L are in the same ratio with E, M,
N, F.
[ v u . Def. 20]
But G, H, K, L are in the same ratio with A, C, D, B;
therefore A, C, D, B are also in the same ratio with E, M,
N,F.
But A, C, D, B are in Continued proportion ;
therefore E, M, N, F are also in continued proportion.
Therefore, as many numbers as have fallen between A, B
in continued proportion with them, so many numbers have also
fallen between E, F in continued proportion.

fall.

T h e Greek word is lurtwrtw,

" f a l l i ' « " = " c a n be interpolated."

If a : b = e :/, and between a, b there are any number of geometric
means c, d, there will be as -many such means between e, f.
Let a, /?, y , 8 be the least possible terms in the same ratio as a,
c, d,

...b.

T h e n a, 8 are prime to one another,
and, ex aequali,

[ v m . 3]

o : 8= a : b

= ,:/.
Therefore e = ma,/= m&, where m is some integer.
[vn. 20]
T a k e the numbers
ma, mf3, my, ... mi.
This is a series in the given ratio, and we have the same number of
geometric means between ma, mS, or e,f, that there are between «, b.

If two numbers be prime to one another, and numbers fall
between them in continued proportion, then, however many
numbers fall between them in continued proportion, so many
will also fall between each of them and an unit in continued
proportion.
Let A, B be two numbers prime to one another, and let
C, D fall between them in continued proportion,
and let the unit E be set o u t ;
I say that, as many numbers as fall between A, B in con-
