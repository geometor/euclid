tinued proportion, so many will also fall between either of
the numbers A, B and the unit in continued proportion.
For let two numbers F, G, the least that are in the ratio
of A, C, D, B, be taken,
three numbers H, K, L with the same property,
and others more by one continually, until their multitude is
equal to the multitude of A, C, D, B.

Let them be taken, and let them be M, N, O, P.
It is now manifest that F by multiplying itself has made
H and by multiplying H has made M, while G by multiplying
itself has made L and by multiplying L has made P.
[ v m . 2, Por.]

And, since M, N, O, P are the least of those which have
the same ratio with F, G,
and A, C, D, B are also the least of those which have the
same ratio with F, G,
[vm. 1]
while the multitude of the numbers M, N, 0, P is equal to the
multitude of the numbers A, C, D, B,
therefore M, N, O, P are equal to A, C, D, B respectively ;
therefore M is equal to A, and P to B.
Now, since F by multiplying itself has made H,
therefore F measures H according to the units in F.
But the unit E also measures F according to the units in it;
therefore the unit E measures the number F the same number
of times as F measures H.
Therefore, as the unit E is to the number F, so is F to H.
[vn. Def. 20]

Again, since F by multiplying H has made M,
therefore H measures M according to the units in F.
