But the unit E also measures the number F according to
the units in i t ;
therefore the unit E measures the number F the same number
of times as H measures M.
Therefore, as the unit E is to the number F, so is H to M.
But it was also proved that, as the unit E is to the number
F, so is F to H;
therefore also, as the unit E is to the number F, so is F to H,
and H to M.
But M is equal to A ;
therefore, as the unit E is to the number F, so is F to H,
and H to A.
For the same reason also,
as the unit E is to the number G, so is G to L and L to B.
Therefore, as many numbers as have fallen between A,
B in continued proportion, so many numbers also have fallen
between each of the numbers A, B and the unit £ in continued
proportion.
Q. E. D.

Suppose there are n geometric means between a, b, two numbers prime to
one another; there are the same number («) of geometric means between r
and a and between i and b.
If e, d... are the n means between a, b,
a,

c,

d ... b

are the least numbers in that ratio, since a, b are prime to one another, [ v m . i ]
T h e terms are therefore respectively identical with
A , A"/J, A " " ^ ... A£», /3" ,
where A, f} is the common ratio in its lowest terms.
[ v m . 2, Por.]
Thus
a = A " , b = j8" .
Now
I : 0 = 0 : a'= a' : a'... = A" : A » ,
N + 1

and

1 : p = B:F

=

p>:P>...=£•:p*»;

whence there are n geometric means between 1, o, and between 1, b.

PROPOSITION 

10.

If numbers fall between each of two numbers and an unit
in continued proportion, however many numbers fall between
each of them and an unit in continued proportion, so many
also will fall between the numbers themselves in continued
proportion.
