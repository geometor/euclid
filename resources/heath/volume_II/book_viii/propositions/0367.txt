For let the numbers D, £ and E, G respectively fall
between the two numbers A, B and the unit C in continued
proportion;
I say that, as many numbers as have fallen between each of
the numbers A, B and the unit C in continued proportion, so
many numbers will also fall between A, B in continued pro­
portion.
For let D by multiplying F make H, and let the numbers
D, F by multiplying H make K, L respectively.

Now, since, as the unit C is to the number D, so is D to £ ,
therefore the unit C measures the number D the same number
of times as D measures E.
[vu. Def. 20]
But the unit C measures the number D according to the
units in D;
therefore the number D also measures E according to the units
in D\
therefore D by multiplying itself has made E.
Again, since, as C is to the number D, so is E to A,
therefore the unit C measures the number D the same number
of times as E measures A.
But the unit C measures the number D according to the
units in D;
therefore E also measures A according to the units in D;
therefore D by multiplying £ has made A.
For the same reason also
F by multiplying itself has made G, and by multiplying G has
made B.
And, since D by multiplying itself has made E and by
multiplying F has made H,
therefore, as D is to F, so is £ to H.
