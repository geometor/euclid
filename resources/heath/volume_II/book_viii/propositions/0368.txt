[VHI. IO

For the same reason also,
as D is to F, so is H to G.
[vn. 18]
Therefore also, as E is to H, so is H to G.
Again, since D by multiplying the numbers E, H has
made A, K respectively,
therefore, as E is to H, so is A to K.
[vu. 17]
But, as E is to H, so is D to F\
therefore also, as D is to F, so is A to K.
Again, since the numbers D, F by multiplying H have
made K, L respectively,
therefore, as D is to F, so is K to L.
[vu. 18]
But, as D is to F, so is A to A*;
therefore also, as A is to K, so is AT to L.
Further, since F by multiplying the numbers H, G has
made L, B respectively,
therefore, as H is to G, so is L to B.
[vu. 17]
But, as H is to G, so is D to
therefore also, as D is to F, so is A to B.
But it was also proved that,
as D is to F, so is ^4 to K and A ' to L ;
therefore also, as
is to A", so is K to A and A to 77.
Therefore ^4, K, L, B are in continued proportion.
Therefore, as many numbers as fall between each of the
numbers A, B and the unit C in continued proportion, so
many also will fall between A, B in continued proportion.
Q. E. D.

D.

If there be n geometric means between 1 and a, and also between 1 and
b, there will be n geometric means between a and b.
T h e proposition is the converse of the preceding.
T h e n means with the extremes form two geometric series of the form

,

where
a" = a, fi" = b.
By multiplying the last term in the first line by the first in the second,
the last but one in the first line by the second in the second, and so on, we
get the series
a"* , a*'/8, a"-'/? ... a /?"- , A/3",
and we have the n means between a and b.
It will be observed that, when Euclid says " For the same reason also, as
D is to F, so is H\o G," the reference is really to vn. 18 instead of v n . 17.
