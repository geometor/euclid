H e infers namely that D x F: Fx F=D : F. But since, by v n . 16, the
order of multiplication is indifferent, he is practically justified in saying " for
the same reason." T h e same thing occurs in later propositions.
PROPOSITION

II.

Between two square numbers there is one mean proportional
number, and the square has to the square the ratio duplicate
of that which the side has to the side.
Let A, B be square numbers,
and let C be the side of A, and D of B;
I say that between A, B there is one mean proportional
number, and A has to B the ratio
duplicate of that which C has to D.
A
For let C by multiplying D make E.
B
Now, since A is a square and C is c
D
its side,
therefore C by multiplying itself has
made A.
For the same reason also
D by multiplying itself has made B.
Since then C by multiplying the numbers C, D has made
A, E respectively,
therefore, as C is to D, so is A to E.
[vn. 17]
For the same reason also,
as C is to D, so is E to B.
[vn. 18]
Therefore also, as A is to E, so is E to B.
Therefore between A, B there is one mean proportional
number.
I say next that A also has to B the ratio duplicate of
that which C has to D.
For, since A, E, B are three numbers in proportion,
therefore A has to B the ratio duplicate of that which /i has
to E.
[v. Def. 9]
But, as A is to E, so is C to D.
Therefore A has to B the ratio duplicate of that which
the side C has to D.
Q. E. D.

According to Nicomachus the theorems in this proposition and the next,
that two squares have one geometric mean, and two cubes two geometric
means, between them are Platonic. Cf. Timaeus, 32 A sqq. and the note
thereon, p. 294 above.
