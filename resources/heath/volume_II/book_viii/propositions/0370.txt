a', 6* being two squares, it is only necessary to form the product ab and
to prove that
a\

are in geometrical progression.

Euclid proves that
a* :ab =

ab:b

by means of v n . 17, 18, as usual.
In assuming that, since a is to b in the duplicate ratio of a? to ab, a* is
to b* in the duplicate ratio of a to b, Euclid assumes that ratios which are
the duplicates of equal ratios are equal. T h i s , an obvious inference from
v. 22, can be inferred just as easily for numbers from v n . 14.

PROPOSITION

12.

Between two cube numbers there are two mean proportional
numbers, and the cube has to the cube the ratio triplicate of that
which the side has to the side.
Let A, B be cube numbers,
and let C be the side of A, and D of B;
I say that between A, B there are two mean proportional
numbers, and A has to B the ratio triplicate of that which C
has to D.
A

E
F
C

H
K

G

For let C by multiplying itself make E, and by multiplying
D let it make F;
let D by multiplying itself make G,
and let the numbers C, D by multiplying F make H, K
respectively.
Now, since A is a cube, and C its side,
and C by multiplying itself has made E,
therefore C by multiplying itself has made E and by multiply­
ing E has made A.
For the same reason also
D by multiplying itself has made G and by multiplying G has
made B.
And, since C by multiplying the numbers C, D has made
E, F respectively,
therefore, as C is to D, so is £ to F.
