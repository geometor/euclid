For the same reason also,
as C is to D, so is F to G.
[ v n . 18]
Again, since C by multiplying the numbers E, F has
made A, H respectively,
therefore, as E is to F, so is A to H.
[vn. 17]
But, as E is to F, so is C to D.
Therefore also, as C is to D, so is A to H.
Again, since the numbers C, D by multiplying F have
made H, K respectively,
therefore, as C is to D, so is H to K.
[vu. 18]
Again, since D by multiplying each of the numbers F, G
has made K, B respectively,
therefore, as F is to G, so is A* to B.
[vn. 17]
But, as F is to G, so is C to Z?;
therefore also, as C is to D, so is A to H,H to AT, and A ' to B.
Therefore H, A ' a r e two mean proportionals between A, B.
I say next that A also has to B the ratio triplicate of that
which C has to D.
For, since A, H, K, B are four numbers in proportion,
therefore A has to B the ratio triplicate of that which A has
to H.
[v. Def. 10]
But, as A is to H, so is C to D ;
therefore ^4 also has to B the ratio triplicate of that which C
has to D.
Q. E. D.

T h e cube numbers a*, P being given, Euclid forms the products a*b, ab*
and then proves, as usual, b y means of v n . 17, 18 that

a,

a'b,

ab\

b°

are in continued proportion.
H e assumes that, since a* has to b* the ratio triplicate of a* : a*b, the
ratio a : P is triplicate of the ratio a : b which is equal to a' : a*b. T h i s
is again an obvious inference from v u . 14.

PROPOSITION

13.

If there be as many numbers as we please in continued
proportion, and each by multiplying itself make some number,
the products will be proportional; and, If the original numbers
by multiplying the products make certain numbers, the latter
will also be proportional.
