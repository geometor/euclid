Let there be as many numbers as we please, A, B, C, in
continued proportion, so that, as A is to B, so is B to C;
let A, B, C by multiplying themselves make D, E, F, and by
multiplying D, E, Elet them make G, 77, K;
I say that D, E, F and G, 77, K are in continued proportion.
A
B

Q
H

C

K

D
M

E

N

F

P
Q

L

O

For let A by multiplying B make L,
and let the numbers A, B by multiplying L make M.
respectively.

N

And again let B by multiplying C make 0,
and let the numbers B, C by multiplying O make P, Q
respectively.
Then, in manner similar to the foregoing, we can prove
that
D, L, E and G, M, N, 77 are continuously proportional in the
ratio of A to B,
and further E, O, F and 77, P, Q, K are continuously propor­
tional in the ratio of B to C.
Now, as A is to B, so is B to C;
therefore 7J>, L, E are also in the same ratio with E, 0, F,
and further G, M, N, 7 7 in the same ratio with 77, P, Q, K.
A n d the multitude of D, L, E is equal to the multitude of
£, O, F, and that of G, M, N, 7 7 to that of 77,
P,Q,K;
therefore, ex aequali,
as D is to E, so is E to F,
and,

as G is to 77, so is 7 7 to K.
