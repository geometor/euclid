Heiberg brackets the words added to the enunciation which extend the
theorem to any powers. T h e words are " a n d this always occurs with the
extremes " ( r a i a c t irepl T O V S a V p o v s T O C T O o-v/i/?aiV«).
T h e y seem to be rightly
suspected on the same grounds as the same words added to the enunciation
of v n . 27. There is no allusion to them in the proof, much less any proof
of the extension.
Euclid forms, besides the squares and cubes of the given numbers, the
products ab, a°b, ab , be, fie) be*. When he says that " we prove in manner
similar to the foregoing," he indicates successive uses of v n . 17, 18 as
in v m . 12.
With our notation the proof is as easy to see for any powers as for squares
and cubes.
T o prove that a", b", c»... are in geometrical progression.
Form all the means between a", b , and set out the series
a", a"" /', a"" * ... ab*-*, b".
T h e common ratio of one term to the next is a : b.
Next take the geometrical progression

Proceed thus for all pairs of consecutive terms.
Now
a : b = b : c= ...
Therefore any pair of succeeding terms in one series are in the same ratio as
any pair of succeeding terms in any other of the series.
And the number of terms in each is the same, namely (« + 1).
Therefore, ex aequali,

If a square measure a square, the side will also measure
the side ; and, if the side measure the side, the square will also
measure the square.
Let A, B be square numbers, let C, D be their sides, and
let A measure B;
I say that C also measures D.
A
For let C by multiplying D make E;
B
therefore A, E, B are continuously pro~~
portional in the ratio of C to D.
[vm. n ]
E
And, since A, E, B are continuously
proportional, and A measures B,
therefore A also measures E.
