And, as A is to E, so is C. to D;
therefore also C measures D.

[vn. Def. 20]

Again, let C measure D ;
I say that A also measures B.
For, with the same construction, we can in a similar
manner prove that A, E, B are continuously proportional in
the ratio of C to D.
A n d since, as C is to D, so is A to E,
and C measures D,
therefore A also measures E.
[vn. Def. 20]
And A, E, B are continuously proportional;
therefore A also measures B.
Therefore etc.
Q. E. D.

If a measures b\ a measures b; and, if a measures b, a measures b .
2

2

(1) a , ab, b are in continued proportion in the ratio of a to b.
2

Therefore, since

2

a measures b ,
2

a measures ab.
2

But

a : ab=a:

Therefore

a measures b.

[vm, 7]

b.

(2) Since a measures b, a" measures ab.
A n d a', ab, b' are continuously proportional.
2

Thus

ab measures b .
2

And

a measures ab.

Therefore

a' measures b .

2

It will be seen that Euclid puts the last step shortly, saying that, since
a measures ab, and a , ab, b are in continued proportion, a measures b .
T h e same thing happens in v m . 1 5 , where the series of terms is one more
than here.

PROPOSITION

15.

If a cube number measure a cube number, the side will also
measure the side; and, if the side measure the side, the cube
will also measure the cube.
For let the cube number A measure the cube B,
and let C be the side of A and D of B;
I say that C measures D.
