Now it is manifest that E, F, G and A, H, K, B are
continuously proportional in the ratio of C t o D.
[vm. n , 12]
And, since A, M, K, B are continuously proportional,
and A measures B,
therefore it also measures H.
[vm. 7]
And, as A is to H, so is C to D ;
therefore C also measures D.
[vn. Def. 20]
Next, let C m e a s u r e / ? ;
I say that A will also measure B.
For, with the same construction, we can prove in a similar
manner that A, H, K, B are continuously proportional in the
ratio of C to D.
And, since C measures D,
and, as C is to D, so is A to H,
therefore A also measures H,
[vn. Def. 20]
so that A measures B also.
Q. E. D.

If a* measures b*, a measures b; and vice versa.
mutandis, the same as for squares.

T h e proof is, mutatis

(1) a", a*b, aP, P are continuously proportional in the ratio of a to b;
and a* measures P.
Therefore a* measures a b;
[ v m . 7]
and hence a measures b.
l

(2) Since a measures b, a* measures a'b.
And, a", a*b, aP, P being continuously proportional, each term measures the
succeeding term;
therefore a* measures P.
