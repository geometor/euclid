If a square number do not measure a square number, neither
will the side measure the side ; and, if the side do not measure
the side, neither will the square measure the square.
Let A, B be square numbers, and let C, D be their sides;
and let A not measure B;
I say that neither does C measure D.
For, if C measures D, A will also
measure B.
[vm. 14]
c
But A does not measure B ;
0
therefore neither will C measure D.

B

Again, let C not measure D ;
I say that neither will A measure B.
For, if A measures B, C will also measure D.
But C does not measure D ;
therefore neither will A measure B.

If a does not measure V, a will not measure b; and, if a does not
measure b, a" will not measure P.
T h e proof is a mere reductio ad absurdum using vm. 14.

If a cube number do not measure a cube number, neither
will the side measure the side ; and, if the side do not measure
the side, neither will the cube measure the cube.
For let the cube number A not measure the cube
number B,
and let C be the side of A, and D
A

I say that C will not measure D.
o—
For if C measures D, A will
also measure B.
[vm. 15]
But A does not measure B ;
therefore neither does C measure D.
Again, let C not measure D;
I say that neither will A measure B.
