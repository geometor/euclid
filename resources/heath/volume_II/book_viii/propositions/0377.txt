For, if A measures B, C will also measure D.
But C does not measure D;
therefore neither will A measure B.

PROPOSITION

18.

Between two similar plane numbers there is one mean
proportional number; and the plane number has to the plane
number the ratio duplicate of that which the corresponding
side has to the corresponding side.
Let A, B be two similar plane numbers,and let the numbers
C, D be the sides of A, and B, F of B.
c—

E
F

Now, since similar plane numbers are those which have
their sides proportional,
[vn. Def. 21]
therefore, as C is to D, so is E to F.
I say then that between A, B there is one mean propor­
tional number, and A has to B the ratio duplicate of that
which C has to E, or D to F, that is, of that which the corre­
sponding side has to the corresponding side.
Now since, as C is to D, so is E to F,
therefore, alternately, as C is to E, so is D to F.
[vn. 13]
And, since A is plane, and C, D are its sides,
therefore D by multiplying C has made A.
For the same reason also
E by multiplying F has made B.
Now let D by multiplying E make G.
Then, since D by multiplying C has made A, and by
multiplying E has made G,
therefore, as C is to E, so is A to G.
