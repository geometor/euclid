But, as C is to E, so is D to F;
therefore also, as D is to E, so is A to G.
Again, since E by multiplying D has made G, and by
multiplying F has made B,
therefore, as D is to E, so is G to Z?.

[vn. 17]

But it was also proved that,
as D is to F, so is A to G;
therefore also, as A is to G, so is G to B.
Therefore A, G, B are in continued proportion.
Therefore between A, B there is one mean proportional
number.
I say next that A also has to B the ratio duplicate of
that which the corresponding side has to the corresponding
side, that is, of that which C has to E or D to F.
For, since A, G, B are in continued proportion,
A has to B the ratio duplicate of that which it has to G.
[v. Def. 9]

And, as A is to G, so is C to E, and so is D to F.
Therefore A also has to B the ratio duplicate of that which
C has to E or D to F.
Q. E. D.

If ab, cd be " similar plane numbers," i.e. products of factors such that
a : b = c : d,

there is one mean proportional between ab and cd; and ab is to cd in the
duplicate ratio of a to c or of b to a".
Form the product be (or aa", which is equal to it, by v n . 19).
Then

ab,

is a series of terms in geometrical progression.
For

a : b = c : d.

Therefore

a : c = b : d.

Therefore

ab : bc = bc : cd.

T h u s be (or ad) is a geometric mean between ab, cd.
A n d ab is to cd in the duplicate ratio of ab to be or of be to of* that is, of
a to £ or of b to a .
