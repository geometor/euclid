Between two similar solid numbers there fall two mean
proportional numbers; and the solid number has to the similar
solid number the ratio triplicate of that which the corresponding
side has to the corresponding side.
Let A, B be. two similar solid numbers, and let C, D, E
be the sides of A, and F\ G, H of B.
Now, since similar solid numbers are those which have
their sides proportional,
[vn. Def. 21]
therefore, as C is to D, so is F to G,
and, as D is to E, so is G to H.
I say that between A, B there fall two mean proportional
numbers, and A has to B the ratio triplicate of that which C
has to F, D to G, and also E to H.

For let C by multiplying D make K, and let F by
multiplying G make L.
Now, since C, D are in the same ratio with F, G,
and K is the product of C, D, and L the product of F, G,
K, L are similar plane numbers;
[vn. Def. 21]
therefore between K, L there is one mean proportional number.
[ v n i . 18]

Let it be M
Therefore M is the product of D, F, as was proved in the
theorem preceding this.
[vm. 18]
Now, since D by multiplying C has made K, and by
multiplying F has made M,
therefore, as C is to F, so is K to M.
[vu. 17]
But, as K is to M, so is M to L.
Therefore K, M, L are continuously proportional in the
ratio of C to F.
