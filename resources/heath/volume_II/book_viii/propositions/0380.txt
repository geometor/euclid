And since, as C is to D, so is F to G,
alternately therefore, as C is to F, so is D to G.
[vu. 13]
For the same reason also,
as Z? is to G, so is ZT to ZZ.
Therefore K, M, L are continuously proportional in the
ratio of C to F, in the ratio of D to G, and also in the ratio
of E to H.
Next, let Z?, Z / by multiplying M make A , O respectively.
Now, since A is a solid number, and C, D, E are its sides,
therefore E by multiplying the product of C, D has made A.
But the product of C, D is K;
therefore ZT by multiplying K has made ^4.
For the same reason also
H by multiplying L has made B.
Now, since Z? by multiplying K has made A, and further
also by multiplying M has made A ,
therefore, as K is to M, so is y4 to iV.
[vn. 17]
But, as K is to
so is C to F, D to £, and also E to Z / ;
therefore also, as C is to F, D to t7, and E to ZZ, so is A to A .
Again, since E, ZZ by multiplying
have made N, 0
respectively,
therefore, as E is to ZZ, so is N to O.
[vn. 18]
But, as ZJ is to ZZ, so is C to Z and D to G;
therefore also, as C is to F, D to £7, and E to ZZ, so is A to
A" and A to O.
Again, since ZZ by multiplying M has made 0, and further
also by multiplying L has made Z?,
therefore, as M is to Z , so is (9 to B.
[vu. 17]
But, as M is to Z , so is C to F, D to (r, and E to ZZ.
Therefore also, as C is to Z D to G, and ZT to H', so not
only is 0 to Z?, but also A to N and N to 0.
Therefore A, N,0, B are continuously proportional in the
aforesaid ratios of the sides.

I say that A also has to B the ratio triplicate of that which
the corresponding side has to the corresponding side, that is,
of the ratio which the number C has to F, or D to G, and
also E to ZZ.
