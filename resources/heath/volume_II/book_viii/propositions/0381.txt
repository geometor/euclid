For, since A, N, O, B are four numbers in continued
proportion,
therefore A has to B the ratio triplicate of that which A has
to N.
[v. Def. 10]
But, as A is to N, so it was proved that C is to F, D to G,
and also E to H.
Therefore A also has to B the ratio triplicate of that which
the corresponding side has to the corresponding side, that is,
of the ratio which the number C has to F, D to G, and also
£ to H.
Q. E. D.

In other words, if a : b : c=d : e :f, then there are two geometric means
between abc, def; and abc is to def in the triplicate ratio of a to d, or b to e,
or c to /
Euclid first takes the plane numbers ab, de (leaving out c, f) and forms
the product bd. T h u s , as in v i n . 18,
ab,

are three terms in geometrical progression in the ratio of a to d, or of b to e.
H e next forms the products of c , / r e s p e c t i v e l y into the mean bd.
Then
abc, cbd, fbd,
def
are in geometrical progression in the ratio of a to d etc.
For
abc : cbd = ab : bd = a : d \
bd:fbd=c:f

And
a : d=b : e = c :/.
T h e ratio of abc to def is the ratio triplicate of that of abc to cbd, i.e. of
that of a to d etc.
PROPOSITION

20.

If one mean proportional number fall between two numbers,
the numbers will be similar plane numbers.
For let one mean proportional number C fall between the
two numbers A, B;
5 1 say that A, B are similar plane numbers.
Let D, E, the least numbers of those which have the same
ratio with A, C, be taken ;
[vn. 33]
therefore D measures A the same number of times that E
measures C.
[vn. 20]
10
Now, as many times as D measures A, so many units let
there be in F;
therefore F by multiplying D has made A,
so that A is plane, and D, F are its sides.
