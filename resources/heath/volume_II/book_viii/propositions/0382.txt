Again, since D, E are the least of the numbers which have
15 the same ratio with C, B,
therefore D measures C the same number of times that E
measures B.

A s many times, then, as E measures B, so many units let
there be in G;
20 therefore E measures B according to the units in G;
therefore G by multiplying E has made B.
Therefore B is plane, and E, G are its sides.
Therefore A, B are plane numbers.
I say next that they are also similar.
For, f since E by multiplying D has made A, and by
multiplying E has made C,
therefore, as D is to E, so is A to C, that is, C to B. [vn. 17]
Again, f since E by multiplying F, G has made C, B
respectively,
30 therefore, as F is to G, so is C to B.
[vu. 17]
But, as C is to B, so is D to E;
therefore also, as D is to E, so is F to G.
A n d alternately, as D is to F, so is E to G.
[vn. 13]
Therefore A,B are similar plane numbers; for their sides
35 are proportional.

This proposition is the converse of vm. 18. If a, c, b are in geometrical
progression, a, b are " similar plane numbers."
Let o : p be the ratio a : c (and therefore also the ratio e : b) in its lowest
terms.
T h e n [vn. 20]
a = ma, c = mp, where m is some integer,
c = na, b = np,
where n is some integer.
