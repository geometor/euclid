T h u s a, b are both products of two factors, i.e. plane.
Again,
o : /3 = a : c = c : b
[ v n . 18]
[ v n . 13]

= m:n.

Therefore, alternately,
a : m = ft : n,
and hence ma, n/J are similar plane numbers.

[Our notation makes the second part still more obvious, for *•=/«/? =//a.]

If two mean proportional numbers fall between ta>o numbers,
the numbers are similar solid numbers.
For let two mean proportional numbers C, D fall between
the two numbers A, B ;
I say that A, B are similar solid numbers.

For let three numbers E, F, G, the least of those which
have the same ratio with A, C, D, be taken ; [vn. 33 or v m . 2]
therefore the extremes of them E, G are prime to one another.
[ v m . 3]

Now, since one mean proportional number F has fallen
between E, G,
therefore E, G are similar plane numbers.
[vm. 20]
Let, then, H, K be the sides of E, and L, M of G.
Therefore it is manifest from the theorem before this that
E, F, G are continuously proportional in the ratio of H to L
and that of K to M.
Now, since E, F, G are the least of the numbers which
have the same ratio with A, C, D,
and the multitude of the numbers E, F, G is equal to the
multitude of the numbers A, C, D,
therefore, ex aequali, as E is to G, so is A to D.
[vn. 14]
But E, G are prime,
primes are also least,
[vn. 21]
and the least measure those which have the same ratio with
