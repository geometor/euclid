them the same number of times, the greater the greater and
the less the less, that is, the antecedent the antecedent and the
consequent the consequent;
[vu. 20]
therefore £ measures A the same number of times that G
measures D.
Now, as many times as E measures A, so many units let
there be in N.
Therefore N by multiplying E has made A.
But E is the product of H, K;
therefore N by multiplying the product of H, K has made A.
Therefore A is solid, and H, K, N are its sides.
Again, since E, F, G are the least of the numbers which
have the same ratio as C, D, B,
therefore E measures C the same number of times that G
measures B.
Now, as many times as £ measures C, so many units let
there be in O.
Therefore G measures B according to the units in O;
therefore O by multiplying G has made B.
But G is the product of L, M ;
therefore O by multiplying the product of L, M has made B.
Therefore B is solid, and L, M, O are its sides ;
therefore A, B are solid.
I say that they are also similar.
For since N, 0 by multiplying £ have made A, C,
therefore, as N is to 0, so is A to C, that is, E to E. [vu. 18]
But, as E is to E, so is H to L and K to M;
therefore also, as H is to L, so is K to M and N to O.
A n d H, K, N are the sides of A, and 0, L, M the sides
oiB.
Therefore A, B are similar solid numbers.
Q. E. D.

T h e converse of v i u . 19. If a, c, d, b are in geometrical progression, a, b
are "similar solid numbers."
Let o, /?, y be the least numbers in the ratio of a, c, d (and therefore also
of c, d, b).
[vn. 33 or vtn. 2
Therefore a, y are prime to one another.
[vm. 3
T h e y are also "similar plane numbers."
[vm. 20
Let
a = mn,
y = pq,
where
m:n=p:q.
