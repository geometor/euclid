Then, by the proof of v m . 20,
a : fi - m : p = n : q.
Now, ex aequali,
a : d = a : y,
and, since a, y are prime to one another,
a = ra, d=ry,
where r is an integer.
But
a = mn:
therefore a = rmn, and therefore a is " solid."
Again, ex aequali,
c : b = a : y,
and therefore
c - sa, b = sy, where s is an integer.
Thus b = spq, and b is therefore "solid."
Now
a : p = a : c = ra : sa
= r :s.
And, from above,
* : f3 = m : p = n : q.
Therefore
r : s = m : p = n : q,
and hence a, b are similar solid numbers.

If three numbers be in continued proportion, and the first
be square, the third will also be square.
Let A, B, C be three numbers in continued proportion,
and let A the first be square ;
I say that C the third is also square.
For, since between A, C there is one
mean proportional number, B,
therefore A, C are similar plane numbers.
[vm. 20]
But A is square ;
therefore C is also square.
Q. E. D.

A mere application of v m . 20 to the particular case where one of the
"similar plane numbers" is square.

If four numbers be in continued proportion, and the first be
cube, the fourth will also be cube.
Let A, B, C, D be four numbers in continued proportion,
and let A be cube ;
I say that D is also cube.
For, since between A, D there
are two mean proportional numbers
B, C,
therefore A, D are similar solid numbers.
