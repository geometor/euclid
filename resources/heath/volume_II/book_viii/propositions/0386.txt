But A is cube ;
therefore D is also cube.
Q. E. D.

A mere application of v m . 21 to the case where one of the " similar solid
numbers " is a cube.

If two numbers have to one another the ratio which a square
number has to a square number, and the first be square, the
second will also be square.
For let the two numbers A, B have to one another the
ratio which the square number C has
to the square number D, and let A be
A
square;
~~
I say that B is also square.
For, since C, D are square,
C, D are similar plane numbers.
Therefore one mean proportional number falls between
C, D.
[vm. 18]
And, as C is to D, so is A to B;
therefore one mean proportional number falls between A, B
also.
[vm. 8]
And A is square ;
therefore B is also square.

Q. E. D.
If a : b = c' : d\ and a is a square, then b is also a square.
For c , d' have one mean proportional cd.
[ v m . 18]
Therefore a, b, which are in the same ratio, have one mean proportional.
[vm. 8]
A n d , since a is square, b must also be a square.

F o r let the two numbers A, B have to one another the
ratio which the cube number C has to the cube number D,
and let A be cube ;
I say that B is also cube.
