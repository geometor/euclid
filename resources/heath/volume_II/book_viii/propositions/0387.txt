For, since C, D are cube,
C, D are similar solid numbers.
Therefore two mean proportional numbers fall between
C, D.

And, as many numbers as fall between C, D in continued
proportion, so many will also fall between those which have
the same ratio with them ;
[vm. 8]
so that two mean proportional numbers fall between A, B
also.
Let E, E so fall.
Since, then, the four numbers A, E, E, B are in continued
proportion,
and A is cube,
therefore B is also cube.
[vm. 23]
Q. E. D.
If a : b-c* : d*, and a is a cube, then b is also a cube.
For c', d' have two mean proportionals.
Therefore a, b also have two mean proportionals.
A n d a is a c u b e :
therefore b is a cube.

Similar plane numbers have to one another the ratio which
a square number has to a square number.
Let A, B be similar plane numbers ;
I say that A has to B the ratio which a square number has
to a square number.

cE-

For, since A, B are similar plane numbers,
therefore one mean proportional number falls between A, B.
