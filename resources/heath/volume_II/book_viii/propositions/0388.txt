Let it so fall, and let it be C;
and let D, E, F, the least numbers of those which have the
same ratio with A, C, B, be taken ;
[vn. 33 or v m . 2]
therefore the extremes of them D, F are square. [vm. 2, Por.]
A n d since, as D is to F, so is A to B,
and D, F are square,
therefore A has to B the ratio which a square number has to
a square number.
Q. E. D.
If a, b are similar " p l a n e numbers," let c be the mean proportional
between them.

T a k e a, fj, y the smallest numbers in the ratio of a, c, b. [vn. 33 or v m . 2
T h e n a, y are squares.

Therefore a, b are in the ratio of a square to a square.

PROPOSITION

27.

Similar solid numbers have to one another the ratio which
a cube number has to a cube number.
Let A, B be similar solid numbers ;
I say that A has to B the ratio which a cube number has to
a cube number.

For, since A, B are similar solid numbers,
therefore two mean proportional numbers fall between A, B.
[vm. 19]
Let C, D so fall,
and let E, F, G, H, the least numbers of those which have
the same ratio with A, C, D, B, and equal with them in
multitude, be taken ;
[vu. 33 or vm. 2]
therefore the extremes of them E, H are cube.
[vm. 2, Por.]
And, as E is to H, so is A to B;
therefore A also has to B the ratio which a cube number has
to a cube number.
Q. E. D.
