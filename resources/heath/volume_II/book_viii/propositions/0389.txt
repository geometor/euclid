T h e same thing as v m . 26 with cubes. It is proved in the same way
except that v m . 19 is used instead of v m . 18.
T h e last note of an-Nairizi in which the name of Heron is mentioned is
on this proposition. Heron is there stated (p. 194—5, ed. Curtze) to have
added the two propositions that,
1. If two numbers have to one another the ratio of a square to a square, the
numbers are similar plane numbers;
2. If two numbers have to one another the ratio of a cube to a cube, the numbers
are similar solid numbers.
T h e propositions are of course the converses of VIII. 26, 27 respectively.
They are easily proved.

(1) If
a:b =
c :d\
then, since there is one mean proportional (cd) between c , d ,

[ v m . 11 or 18]
there is also one mean proportional between a, b.
[ v m . 8]
Therefore a, b are similar plane numbers.
[ v m . 20]
(2) is similarly proved by the use of v m . 12 or i y , v m . 8, v m . 21.
T h e insertion by Heron of the first of the two propositions, the converse
of v m . 26, is perhaps an argument in favour of the correctness of the text of
i x . 10, though (as remarked in the-note on that proposition) it does not give
the easiest proof Cf. Heron's extension of v n . 3 tacitly assumed by Euclid
in v n . 33.
