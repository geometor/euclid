(Aristotle) 181: Nicom. divides even into
three classes (i)even-times even and (i)evenlimes odd as extremes, and (3) odd-times
even as intermediate 181-3
Even-times even: Euclid's use differs from
use by Nicomachus, Theon of Smyrna and
Iamblichus 181-1
Even-times odd in Euclid different from evenodd of Nicomachus and the rest 181-4
