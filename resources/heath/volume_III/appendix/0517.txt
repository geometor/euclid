Let ABC be a circle, and BC the side of the inscribed regular pentagon.
Take D the centre of the circle, draw DE from D perpendicular to BC,
and produce DE both ways to meet the circle in E, A.
I say that DE is half the sum of the side of the hexagon and of the side
of the decagon inscribed in the same circle.
Let DC, CE be joined; make GE equal to EF, and join GC.
Since the circumference of the circle is five
times the arc BBC,
and half the circumference of the circle is the arc
ACE,
while the arc BC is half the arc BBC,
therefore
(arc ACE) = 5 (arc EC)
or
(arc AC) = 4 (sac CE).
Hence
L ADC • 4 L CDF,
and therefore

Thus

LAFC=I

L CDF.

L CGF= L. AFC= 2 (. CDF;

therefore [1. 32] LCDG

=

LDCG,

so that
DG=GC=CF.
And GE = EF;
therefore
DE = EF + EC.
Add DE to each ;
therefore
2DE = DF+ EC.
And DFis the side of the regular hexagon, and EC the side of the regular
decagon, inscribed in the same circle.
Therefore etc.

"Next it is manifest from the theorem [12] in Book xm. that the perpen­
dicular drawn from the centre of the circle to the side of the equilateral triangle
[inscribed in it] is half of the radius of the circle.

[Prop. 2.] " The same circle circumscribes both the pentagon of the dodeca
hedron and the triangle of the icosahedron inscribed in the same sphere.
" This is proved by Aristaeus in his work entitled Comparison of the five
figures. But Apollonius proves in the second edition of his comparison of the
dodecahedron with the icosahedron that, as the surface of the dodecahedron
is to the surface of the icosahedron, so also is the dodecahedron itself to the
icosahedron, because the perpendicular from the centre of the sphere to the
pentagon of the dodecahedron and to the triangle of the icosahedron is the
same.
" But it is right that I too should prove that
[Prop. 2] The same circle circumscribes both the pentagon of the dodecahedr
and the triangle of the icosahedron inscribed in the same sphere
"For this I need the following

Lemma.

" If an equilateral and equiangular pentagon be inscribed in a circle, the sum
of the squares on the straight line subtending hvo sides and on the side of the
pentagon is five times the square on the radius."
