Let ABC be a circle, AC the side of the pentagon, D the centre ;
draw DF perpendicular to AC and produce it to
B,£;
join AB, AE.
I say that
BA* + AC* = SDE*.

For, since BE = 2ED,
BE?

And
therefore
But
therefore

=

4ELV.

BE* = BA* + AE*;
BA* + AE* + ED* - 5 E D .
AC* = DE* + EA*;
[Eucl. xm. 10]
BA* + AC* = $DE*.

" This being proved, it is required to prove that the same circle circum­
scribes both the pentagon of the dodecahedron and the triangle of the
icosahedron inscribed in the same sphere."
Let AB be the diameter of the sphere, and let a dodecahedron and an
icosahedron be inscribed.

Let CDEFG be one pentagon of the dodecahedron, and KLH one
triangle of the icosahedron.
I say that the radii of the circles circumscribing them are equal.
Join DG; then DG is the side of a cube inscribed in the sphere.
[Eucl. XIII, 17]
Take a straight line MN such that AB* = $MN*.
Now the square on the diameter of the sphere is five times the square on
the radius of the circle from which the icosahedron is described.
[xm. 16, Por.]
Therefore MN is equal to the radius of the circle passing through the five
vertices of the icosahedron which form a pentagon.
Cut MN in extreme and mean ratio at O, MO being the greater segment.
Therefore MO is the side of the decagon in the circle with radius MN.
[xm. 9 and 5, converse]
Now
$MN*=AB*=$DG*.
[xm. 15]
But
3DG* : CG*=SMN*
: sMO*
(since, if DG is cut in extreme and mean ratio, the greater segment is equal
to CG, and, if two straight lines are cut- in extreme and mean ratio, their
segments are in the same ratio : see lemma later, op. 518—9).
