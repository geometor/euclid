And

5MO

+ 5MN* = t,KL\

[This follows from xm. i o , since KL is, by the construction of xm. 16, the
side of the regular pentagon in the circle with radius equal to MN, that is, the
circle in which MN is the side of the inscribed hexagon and MO the side of
the inscribed decagon.]
Therefore
5 KL = 3 CG* + 3DG*.
But
5KL* = 15 (radius of circle about KLBTf,
[xm. 12]
and
$DG* + sCG* = 15 (radius of circle about CDEFGf.
[Lemma above]
Therefore the radii of the two circles are equal.

Q. E. D.

[Prop. 3.] " If there be an equilateral and equiangular pentagon and a
circle circumscribed about it, and if a perpendicular be drawn from the centre
one side, then
30 times the rectangle contained by the side and the perpendicular is equal
the surface of the dodecahedron."
Let ABCDE be the pentagon, B the centre of the circle, EG the
perpendicular on a- side CD.
I say that
A
30CD. EG - 12 (area of pentagon).
Let CE, ED be joined.
Then, since
CD.FG=
2(ACDE),
5 CD. EG = 10 ( A CDF),
whence
30CD. FG =12 (area of pentagon).
Similarly we can prove that,
[Prop. 4] If ABC be an equilateral triangle in a
circle, D the centre, and DE perpendicular to BC,
30BC. DE = (surface of icosahedron).
For
DE.BC=2(ADBC);
therefore
3DE.
BC=6(ADBC)
= 2 ( A ABC),
whence
$oDE. BC= 20 (AABC).
It follows that [Prop. 5]
(surface of dodecahedron) : (surface of icosahedron)
= (side ofpentagon). (its perpendicular) : (side of triangle). (its perp.).

" This being clear, we have next to prove that,
[Prop. 6] As the surface of the dodecahedron is to the surface of the icosahedro
so is the side of the cube to the side of the icosahedron."
