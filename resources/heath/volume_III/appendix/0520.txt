Let ABC be the circle circumscribing the pentagon of the dodecahedron
and the triangle of the icosahedron, and let CD
be the side of the triangle, AC that of the
pentagon.
Let E be the centre, and EF, EG perpen­ H
diculars to CD, AC.
Produce EG to meet the circle in B and
join BC.
Set out H equal to the side of the cube in­
scribed in the same sphere.
I say that
(surface of dodecahedron) : (surface of icosahedron)
= H: CD.
For, since the sum of EB, BC is divided at B in extreme and mean ratio,
and BE is the greater segment,
[xm. 9]
and EG = \ (EB + BC),
[Prop. 1]
while EF= \BE,
[see p. 513 above]
therefore, if EG is divided in extreme and mean ratio, the greater segment is
equal to EB [that is to say, since EB is the greater segment of EB + BC
divided in extreme and mean ratio, \EB is the greater segment of
\ (EB + BC) similarly divided].
But, if H is also divided in extreme and mean ratio, the greater segment
is equal to CA.
[xm. 17, Por.]
Therefore
H : CA = EG : EF,
or
FE .H=CA. EG.
And, since
H: CD = FE. H: FE. CD,
and
FE .H=CA. EG,
therefore
H: CD = CA . EG : FE. CD
= (surface of dodecahedron) : (surf, of icos.).
[Prop. 5]
Another proof of the same theorem.
Preliminary.
Let ABC be a circle and AB, A C sides of an inscribed regular pentagon.
Join BC; take D the centre of the circle, join AD and produce it to
meet the circle at E. Join BD.
Let DF be made equal to \AD, and CH equal
to \CG.
I say that
rect AF. BH= (area of pentagon).
For, since AD = 2DF,
AF= \AD.
And, since GC= 3HC,
GC = \GH.
Therefore
FA : AD = CG : GH,
so that
AF. GH=AD. CG
= AD.BG
= z(CxABD).
