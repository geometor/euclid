Therefore
5AF. GH= io(AABD) - 2 (area of pentagon).
And GH= 2HC;
therefore
5AF. HC = (area of pentagon),
or
AF. BH - (area o'f pentagon).
Proof of theorem.
This being clear, let the circle be set out which circumscribes the pentagon
of the dodecahedron and the triangle of the icosahe­
dron inscribed in the same sphere.
Let ABC be the circle, and AB, A C two sides of
the pentagon; join BC.
Take E the centre of the circle, join AE and
produce it to F.
Let AE= EG,
KC = 3CH.
Through G draw DM at right angles to AF
meeting the circle at D, M;
DM is then the side of the inscribed equilateral
triangle.
Join AD, AM, which are equal to DM.
Now, since
AG. BH = (area of pentagon),
and
AG . GD = (area of triangle),
therefore
BH: GD = (area of pentagon) : (area of triangle),
and
12BH: 20GD = (surface of dod.) : (surface of icos.).
But izBH=\oBC, since BH=$HC, and BC=6HC;
and 2oGD= 10DM;
therefore
(surface of dodecahedron) : (surface of icosahedron)
= (side of cube) : (side of icosahedron).

" Next we have to prove that,
[Prop. 7] If any straight line whatever be cut in extreme aud mean ratio, then,
as is (1) the straight line the square on which is equal to the sum of the squares
on the whole line and on the greater segment to (2) the straight line the square
which is equal to the sum of t/te squares on the whole and on the lesser segment
so is (3) the side of the cube to (4) the side of the icosahedron."
Let AHB be the circle circumscribing both the pentagon of the dodeca­
hedron and the triangle of the icosahedron inscribed
in the same sphere, C the centre of the circle, and
CB any radius divided at D in extreme and mean
ratio, CD being the greater segment.
CD is then the side of the decagon inscribed in
the circle.
[xm. 9 and 5, converse]
Let E be the side of the icosahedron, F that of
the dodecahedron, and G that of the cube, inscribed
in the sphere.
Then E, Fare the sides of the equilateral triangle
and pentagon inscribed in the circle, and, if G is E
divided in extreme and mean ratio, the greater F segment is equal to F.
