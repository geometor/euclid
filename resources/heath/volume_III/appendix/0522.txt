Thus

E* = BC*,
[xm. 12]
CB* + BD> = CD*.
[xm. 4]
Therefore
E* : CB* = (CB* + BD*): CD,
or
£* : (CB* + BD) = CB* : CD*
= G* : F*.
Therefore, alternately and inversely,
G* : £* = F* : (CB* + BD*).
But B* = BC* + CD; for the square on the side of the pentagon is equal
to the sum of the squares on the sides of the hexagon and decagon inscribed
in the same circle.
[xm. 10]
Therefore
G*:£* = (BC*+ CD) :(CB* + BD),
which is the result required.

It has now to be proved that
[Prop. 8] (Side of cube) : (side of icosahedron)
= (content of dodecahedron) ; (content of icosahedron).
Since equal circles circumscribe the pentagon of the dodecahedron and
the triangle of the icosahedron inscribed in the same sphere,
and in a sphere equal circular sections are equally distant from the centre,
the perpendiculars from the centre of the sphere to the faces of the two solids
are equal;
in other words, the pyramids with the centre as vertex and the pentagons of
the dodecahedron and the triangles of the icosahedron respectively as bases
are of equal height.
Therefore the pyramids are to one another as their bases.
Thus
(12 pentagons) : (20 triangles)
= (12 pyramids on pentagons): (20 pyramids on triangles),
or
(surface of dodecahedron) : (surface of icosahedron)
= (content of dod.) : (content of icos.).
Therefore
(content of dodecahedron) : (content of icosahedron)
= (side of cube) : (side of icosahedron). [Prop. 6]
Lemma.

If two straight lines be cut in extreme and mean ratio, the segments of both
are in one and the same ratio.
Let AB be cut in extreme and mean ratio at C, AC being the greater
segment;
and let DE be cut in extreme and mean ratio at E, DF being the greater
segment.
I say that AB : AC = DE : DF.
