the same clear view of what they denoted (i.e. by simple inspection) as our
system of symbols assures to us. For this reason it was necessary to under­
take a classification of the irrational magnitudes which had been arrived at by
successive solution of equations of the second degree." To much the same
effect Tannery wrote in 1882 (De la solution giometrique des probfemes du
second degre avant Euclide in Memoires de la Society des sciences physiques et
naturelles de Bordeaux, 2" Serie, iv. pp. 395—416). Accordingly Book x.
formed a repository of results to whjch could be referred problems which
depended on the solution of certain types of equations, quadratic and biquad­
ratic but reducible to quadratics.
Consider the quadratic equations
x* ± 2ax .p±f3.p = o,
where p is a rational straight line, and a, /} are coefficients. Our quadratic
equations in algebra leave out the p; but I put it in, because it has always to
be remembered that Euclid's x is a straight line, not an algebraical quantity,
and is therefore to be found in terms of, or in relation to, a certain assumed
rational straight line, and also because with Euclid p may be not only of the
2

form
where a represents a units of length, but also of the form
J\.a,
which represents a length "commensurable in square only" with the unit of
length, or J A where A represents a number (not square) of units of area.
The use therefore of p in our equations makes it unnecessary to multiply
different cases according to the relation of p to the unit of length, and has the
further advantage that, e.g., the expression p + Jk. p is just as general as the
expression Jk. p + J\. p, since p covers the form Jk. p, both expressions
covering a length either commensurable in length, or "commensurable in
square only," with the unit of length.
Now the positive roots of the quadratic equations
i

x ± 2ax.p + f}.p' = o

can only have the following forms
•*, = p(a +vV^3), *,' = p ( a - v V - / 3 ) j
x = p (vV + /3 + a), X ' = p (Jtf~+fi - a) J "
The negative roots do not come in, since x must be a straight line. The
omission however to bring in negative roots constitutes no loss of generality,
since the Greeks would write the equation leading to negative roots in another
form so as to make them positive, i.e. they would change the sign of x in the
equation.
Now the positive roots x x,', x. , x may be classified according to the
character of the coefficents a, /3 and their relation to one another.

I. Suppose that o, do not contain any surds, i.e. are either integers or
of the form mjn, where m, n are integers.
Now in the expressions for x x it may be that
m
(1) a is of the form -=- a .
n
Euclid expresses this by saying that the square on ap exceeds the square
on pJa-~p by the square on a straight line commensurable in length with ap.
In this case x is, in Euclid's terminology, a first binomial straight line,
and 0/ afirstapotome.
