Xj is a fourth binomial,

Euclid expresses this by saying that the square on p*Ja* + p exceeds the
square on op by the square on a straight line commensurable in length with
ps/a'

+ P.
In this case x , is, in Euclid's terminology, a second binomial,
x ' a second apotome.

Now suppose that a is of the form aJ^> where m, n are integers, and

let us denote it by JX.
Then in this case

x = p(jx

Thus
a;,' are of the same form as x x,'.
If Jx - 0 in x , , Xi is not surd but of the form mjn, and if Jx + /? in x,,
is not surd but of the form mjn, the roots are comprised among the forms
already shown, the first, second, fourth and fifth binomials and apotomes.
If six-p in * i , Xi is surd, then

(1) we may have P of the form -^X, and in this case
x is a third binomial straight line,

x is a f&aSi binomial straight line,

With the expressions for x,, x,' the distinction between the third and sixth
binomials and apotomes is of course the distinction between the cases
