in the six different forms that each may take, we find six new irrationals with
a positive sign separating the two terms, and six corresponding irrationals with
a negative sign. These are of course roots of the equations

x* ± 2ax . p' ±

. p* = o.

These irrationals really come before the others in Euclid's order (x. 36—
41 for the positive sign and x. 73—-78 for the negative sign). As we shall
see in due course, the straight lines actually found by Euclid are
1.
p + Jk. p, the binomial (17 in SVO ovopAriav)
and the apotome (aworopy),
which are the positive roots of the biquadratic (reducible to a quadratic)
x*-2(i + k)p .x*+(i-k) p
= o.2.
kip ± k^p, the first bimedial (IK SVO lUtrvm irpumj)
and the first apotome of a medial (p.eo-i;s OVO-TO/M) irpdrrj),
which are the positive roots of
x* - Jk (1 + k) p . x + k(i - kf p = o.
