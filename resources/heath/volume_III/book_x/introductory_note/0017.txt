course includes Jk. a.
a! Swd/xcmt afird are the straight lines the squares on which are equal to
the areas, in accordance' with the regular meaning of SuVao-ftu. It is scarcely
possible, in a book written in geometrical language, to translate oWa/tenj as
the square root (of an area) and Swao-ffai as tofiethe square root (of an area),
although I can use the term " square root" when in my notes I am using an
algebraical expression to represent an area; I shall therefore hereafter use the
word "side" for cWa/icVi) and "to be the side of" for Svvaadm, so that
"side" will in such expressions be a short way of expressing the "side of
a square equal to (an area)." In this particular passage it is not quite practi­
cable to use the words " side of" or " straight line the square on which is equal
to," for these expressions occur just afterwards for two alternatives which the
word Swaut'n; covers. I have therefore exceptionally translated " the straight
lines which produce them " (i.e. if squares are described upon them as sides).

literally " the (straight lines) which
describe squares equal to them : a peculiar use of the active of dvaypdtptiv,
the meaning being of course " the straight lines on which are described the
squares " which are equal to the rectilineal figures.
