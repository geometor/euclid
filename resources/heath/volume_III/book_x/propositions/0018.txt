PROPOSITION

I.

Two unequal magnitudes being set out, if from the greater
there be subtracted a magnitude greater than its half, and from
that which is left a magnitude greater than its half, and if
this process be repeated continually, there will be left some
magnitude which will be less than the lesser magnitude set out.
Let AB, C be two unequal magnitudes of which AB is
the greater:
K
A

I say that, if from AB there be — — '

than its half, and from that which
is left a magnitude greater than its half, and if this process be
repeated continually, there will be left some magnitude which
will be less than the magnitude C.
For C if multiplied will sometime be greater than AB.
[cf. v. Def. 4]

Let it be multiplied, and let DE be a multiple of C, and
greater than. AB;
let DE be divided into the parts DE, EG, GE equal to C,
from AB let there be subtracted BH greater than its half,
and, from AH, HK greater than its half,
and let this process be repeated continually until the divisions
in AB are equal in multitude with the divisions in DE.
Let, then, AK, KH, HB be divisions which are equal in
multitude with DE, EG, GE.
Now, since DE is greater than AB,
and from DE there has been subtracted EG less than its
half,
and, from AB, BH greater than its half,
therefore the remainder GD is greater than the remainder HA.
