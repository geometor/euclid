If, when the less of two unequal magnitudes is continually
subtracted in turn from the greater, that which is left never
measures the one before it, the magnitudes will be incom­
mensurable.
For, there being two unequal magnitudes AB, CD, and
AB being the less, when the less is continually subtracted
in turn from the greater, let that which is left over never
measure the one before it;
I say that the magnitudes AB, CD are incommensurable.

For, if they are commensurable, some magnitude will
measure them.
Let a magnitude measure them, if possible, and let it be E;
let AB, measuring FD, leave CE less than itself,
let CF measuring BG, leave A G less than itself,
and let this process be repeated continually, until there is left
some magnitude which is less than £ .
Suppose this done, and let there be left A G less than E.
Then, since E measures AB,
while AB measures DE,
therefore E will also measure FD.
But it measures the whole CD also ;
therefore it will also measure the remainder CF.
But CF measures BG;
therefore E also measures BG.
But it measures the whole AB also;
therefore it will also measure the remainder A G, the greater
the less:
which is impossible.
Therefore no magnitude will measure the magnitudes A B,

CD;
therefore the magnitudes AB, CD are incommensurable.
