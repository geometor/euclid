and this process may be continued indefinitely until (x. i) we have a square
as small as we please, the side and diagonal of which are integral multiples of
a finite unit: which is absurd.
Therefore a, d are incommensurable.
It will be observed that this method is the opposite of that shown in the
Pythagorean series of side- and diagonal-numbers, the squares being
successively smaller instead of larger.

PROPOSITION

3.

Given two commensurable magnitudes, to find their greatest
common measure.
Let the two given commensurable magnitudes be AB, CD
of which AB is the less ;
thus it is required to find the greatest common measure of

AB, CD.
Now the magnitude AB

either measures CD or it does

not.
If then it measures it—and it measures itself also—AB is
a common measure of AB, CD.
And it is manifest that it is also the greatest;
for a greater magnitude than the magnitude AB will not
measure AB.

Next, let AB not measure CD.
Then, if the less be continually subtracted in turn from
the greater, that which is left over will sometime measure
the one before it, because AB, CD are not incommensurable;
[cf. x. 2]

let AB, measuring ED, leave EC less than itself,
let EC, measuring FB, leave AF less than itself,
and let AF measure CE.
Since, then, AF measures CE,
while CE measures FB,
therefore AF will also measure FB.
But it measures itself also;
therefore AF will also measure the whole AB.
