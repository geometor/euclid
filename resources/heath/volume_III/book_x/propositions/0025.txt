But AB measures DE;
therefore AF will also measure ED.
But it measures CE also ;
therefore it also measures the whole CD.
Therefore AF is a common measure of AB,

CD.

I say next that it is also the greatest.
For, if not, there will be some magnitude greater than AF
which will measure AB, CD.
Let it be G.
Since then G measures AB,
while A B measures ED,
therefore G will also measure ED.
But it measures the whole CD also ;
therefore G will also measure the remainder CE.
But CE measures FB ;
therefore G will also measure FB.
But it measures the whole AB also,
and it will therefore measure the remainder AF, the greater
the less:
which is impossible.
Therefore no magnitude greater than AF will measure

AB,

CD;

therefore AF is the greatest common measure of AB, CD.
Therefore the greatest common measure of the two given
commensurable magnitudes AB, CD has been found.
Q. E. D.


PORISM.
From this it is manifest that, if a magnitude
measure two magnitudes, it will also measure their greatest
common measure.

This proposition for two commensurable magnitudes is, mutatis mutandis,
exactly the same as vn. 2 for numbers. We have the process
b)a(p
pb
~c)b(q
qc
T\
d)c(r1
rd
where c is equal to rd and therefore there is no remainder.
