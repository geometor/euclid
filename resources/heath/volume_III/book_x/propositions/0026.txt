It is then proved that d is a common measure of a, b; and next, by a
reductio ad absurdum, that it is the greatest common measure, since any
common measure must measure d, and no magnitude greater than d can
measure d. The reductio ad absurdum is of course one of form only.
The Porism corresponds exactly to the Porism to vn. 2.
The process of finding the greatest common measure is probably given in
this Book, not only for the sake of completeness, but because in x. 5 a
common measure of two magnitudes A, B is assumed and used, and therefore
it is important to show that such a measure can be found if not already
known.
PROPOSITION

4.

Given three commensurable magnitudes, tofindtheirgreatest
common measure.
Let A, B, C be the three given commensurable magnitudes;
thus it is required to find the greatest
common measure of A, B, C.
A
Let the greatest common measure B
of the two magnitudes A, B be taken, 0
and let it be D ;
[x. 3]
then D either measures C, or does
not measure it.
First, let it measure it.
Since then D measures C,
while it also measures A, B,
therefore D is a common measure of A, B, C.
And it is manifest that it is also the greatest;
for a greater magnitude than the magnitude D does not
measure A, B.

Next, let D not measure C.
I say first that C, D are commensurable.
For, since A, B, C are commensurable,
some magnitude will measure them,
and this will of course measure A, B also ;
so that it will also measure the greatest common measure of
A, B, namely D.
[x. 3, Por.]
But it also measures C;
so that the said magnitude will measure C, D;
therefore C, D are commensurable.
