Now let their greatest common measure be taken, and let
it be
[x. 3]
>e E.
E.
Since then E measures
measun D,
while D measures A, B,
therefore E will also measure A, B.
But it measures C also ;
therefore E measures A, B, C;
therefore E is a common measure of A, B, C.
I say next that it is also the greatest.
For, if possible, let there be some magnitude ^greater than
E, and let it measure A, B, C.
Now, since F measures A, B, C,
it will also measure A, B,
and will measure the greatest common measure of A, B.
[x. 3, Por.]
But the greatest common measure of A, B is D ;
therefore F measures D.
But it measures C also ;
therefore F measures C, D ;
therefore F will also measure the greatest common measure
of C, D.
[x. 3, Por.]
But that is E;
therefore F will measure E, the greater the less :
which is impossible.
Therefore no magnitude greater than the magnitude E
will measure A, B, C;
therefore E is the greatest common measure of A, B, C if D
do not measure C,
and, if it measure it, D is itself the greatest common measure.
Therefore the greatest common measure of the three given
commensurable magnitudes has been found.
PORISM.
From this it is manifest that, if a magnitude
measure three magnitudes, it will also measure their greatest
common measure.
Similarly too, with more magnitudes, the greatest common
measure can be found, and the porism can be extended.
