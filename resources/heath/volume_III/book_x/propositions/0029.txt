therefore the unit measures E the same number of times as C
measures B;
therefore, as C is to B, so is the unit to E.
But it was also proved that,
as A is to C, so is D to the unit;
therefore, ex aequali,
as A is to B, so is the number D to E.
[v. 22J
Therefore the commensurable magnitudes A, B have to
one another the ratio which the number D has to the number E.
Q. E. D.


The argument is as follows. If a, b be commensurable magnitudes, they
have some common measure c, and
a = mc,
b = TIC,

where m, n are integers.
It follows that
c: a = 1 : m
(1),
or, inversely,
a : c = m : 1;
and also that
c:b = \:n,
so that, ex aequali,
a:b = m:n.
It will be observed that, in stating the proportion (1), Euclid is merely
expressing the fact that a is the same multiple of c that m is of 1. In other
words, he rests the statement on the definition of proportion in vn. Def. 20.
This, however, is applicable only to four numbers, and c, a are not numbers but
magnitudes. Hence the statement of the proportion is not legitimate unless
it is proved that it is true in the sense of v. Det. 5 with regard to magnitudes
in general, the numbers 1, m being magnitudes. Similarly with regard to the
other proportions in the proposition.
There is, therefore, a hiatus. Euclid ought to have proved that magnitudes
which are proportional in the sense of vn. Def. 20 are also proportional in the
sense of v. Def. 5, or that the proportion of numbers is included in the
proportion of magnitudes as a particular case. Simson has proved this in his
Proposition C inserted in Book v. (see Vol. 11. pp. 126—8). The portion of
that proposition which is required here is the proof that,
if
a = mb \
c = md)'
then
a:b = c:d, in the sense of v. Def. 5.
Take any equimultiples pa, pc of a, c and any equimultiples qb, qd of b, d.
Now
pa = pmb \
pc =pmd)
But, according as pmb > = <ob,pmd> = <qd.
Therefore, according as pa > = < qb, pa > = < qd.
And pa, pc are any equimultiples of a, c, and qb, qd any equimultiples
of b, d.
Therefore
a:b = c:d.
