6.

If two magnitudes have to one another the ratio which a
number has to a number, the magnitudes will be commensurable.
For let the two magnitudes A, B have to one another the
ratio which the number D has to the number E ;
5 I say that the magnitudes A, B are commensurable.
A

B

C

For let A be divided into as many equal parts as there
are units in D,
and let C be equal to one of them ;
and let F be made up of as many magnitudes equal to C as
io there are units in E.
Since then there are in A as many magnitudes equal to C
as there are units in D,
whatever part the unit is of D, the same part is C of A also ;
therefore, as C is to A, so is the unit to D.
[vn. Def. 20]

But the unit measures the number D ;
therefore C also measures A.
And since, as C is to A, so is the unit to D,
therefore, inversely, as A is to C, so is the number D to the
unit.
[cf. v. 7, Por.]
20
Again, since there are in F as many magnitudes equal
to C as there are units in E,
therefore, as C is to F, so is the unit to E.
[vn. Def. 20]
But it was also proved that,
as A is to C, so is D to the unit;
25 therefore, ex aequali, as A is to E, so is D to E.
[v. 22]
But, as D is to E, so is A to B;
therefore also, as A is to B, so is it to F also.
[v. 11]
Therefore A has the same ratio to each of the magnitudes

B, F;
30 therefore B is equal to F.
But C measures F;
therefore it measures B also.
Further it measures A also ;
therefore C measures A, B.
