Therefore A is commensurable with B.
Therefore etc.

PORISM.
From this it is manifest that, if there be two
numbers, as D, E, and a straight line, as A, it is possible to
make a straight line [E~\ such that the given straight line is to
40 it as the number D is to the number E.
And, if a mean proportional be also taken between A, E,
as B,
as A is to F, so will the square on A be to the square on B,
that is, as the first is to the third, so is the figure on the first
45 to that which is similar and similarly described on the second.
[vi. 19, Por.]
But, as A is to E, so is the number D to the number E;
therefore it has been contrived that, as the number D is to
the number E, so also is the figure on the straight line A to
the figure on the straight line B.
Q. E. D.

15. But the unit measures the number D ; therefore C also measures A.
These words are redundant, though they are apparently found in all the Mss.

The same link to connect the proportion of numbers with the proportion
of magnitudes as was necessary in the last proposition is necessary here. This
being premised, the argument is as follows.
Suppose
a:b = m:n,
where m, n are (integral) numbers.
Divide a into m parts, each equal to c, say,
so that
a = pie.
Now take d such that
d=nc.
Therefore we have
a : c = m : I,
and
c:d=\:n,
so that, ex aequali,
a : d =m : n
= a : *, by hypothesis.
Therefore b = d~nc,
so that c measures b n times, and a, b are commensurable.
The Porism is often used in the later propositions. It follows (1) that, if
a be a given straight line, and m, n any numbers, a straight line x can be
found such that
a : x — m : n.
(2) We can find a straight line y such that
a :y' = m : n.
For we have only to take y, a mean proportional between a and x, as
previously found, in which case a, y, x are in continued proportion and
