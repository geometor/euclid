[x. 7—9
7.

Incommensurable magnitudes have not to one another the
ratio which a number has to a number.
Let A, B be incommensurable magnitudes ;
I say that A has not to B the ratio which a number has to a
number.
For, if A has to B the ratio which a number has to a
number, A will be commensurable with B.
[x. 6]
But it is not;
therefore A has not to B the ratio which a
g
number has to a number.
Therefore etc.

8.

If two magnitudes have not to one another the ratio which
a number has to a number, the magnitudes will be incom­
mensurable.
For let the two magnitudes A, B not have to one another
the ratio which a number has to a number;
I say that the magnitudes A, B are incom—^
mensurable.
For, if they are commensurable, A will have to B the
ratio which a number has to a number.
[x. 5]
But it has not;
therefore the magnitudes A, B are incommensurable.
Therefore etc.
PROPOSITION

9.

The squares on straight lines commensurable in length have
to one another the ratio which a square number has to a square
number; and squares which have to one another the ratio
which a square number has to a square number will also have
their sides commensurable in length. But the squares on
straight lines incommensurable in length have not to one
another the ratio which a square number has to a square
number; and squares which have not to one another the ratio
which a square number has to a square number will not have
their sides commensurable in length either.
