For let A, B be commensurable in length ;
I say that the square on A
has to the square on B the
—
ratio which a square number
~~
has to a square number.
For, since A is commensurable in length with B,
therefore A has to B the ratio which a number has to a
number.
[x. 5]
Let it have to it the ratio which C has to D.
Since then, as A is to B, so is C to D,
while the ratio of the square on A to the square on B is
duplicate of the ratio of A to B,
for similar figures are in the duplicate ratio of their corresponding sides;
[vi. 20, Por.]
and the ratio of the square on C to the square on D is duplicate
of the ratio of C to D,
for between two square numbers there is one mean proportional
number, and the square number has to the square number the
ratio duplicate of that which the side has to the side ; [vm. n ]
therefore also, as the Square on A is to the square on B, so
is the square on C to the square on D.
B

Next, as the square on A is to the square on B, so let
the square on C be to the square on D ;
I say that A is commensurable in length with B.
For since, as the square on A is to the square on B, so is
the square on C to the square on D,
while the ratio of the square on A to the square on B is
duplicate of the ratio of A to B,
and the ratio of the square on C to the square on D is duplicate
of the ratio of C to D,
therefore also, as A is to B, so is C to D.
Therefore A has to B the ratio which the number C has
to the number D ;
therefore A is commensurable in length with B.
[x. 6]
Next, let A be incommensurable in length with B ;
I say that the square on A has not to the square on B the
ratio which a square number has to a square number.
For, if the square on A has to the square on B the ratio
