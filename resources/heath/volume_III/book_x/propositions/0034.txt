which a square number has to a square number, A will be
commensurable with B.
But it is not;
therefore the square on A has not to the square on B the
ratio which a square number has to a square number.
Again, let the square on A not have to the square on B
the ratio which a square number has to a square number ;
I say that A is incommensurable in length with B.
For, if A is commensurable with B, the square on A will
have to the square on B the ratio which a square number has
to a square number.
But it has not;
therefore A is not commensurable in length with B.
Therefore etc.
PORISM.
And it is manifest from what has been proved
that straight lines commensurable in length are always com­
mensurable in square also, but those commensurable in square
are not always commensurable in length also.
[LEMMA.
It has been proved in the arithmetical books
that similar plane numbers have to one another the ratio
which a square number has to a square number,
[vm. 26]
and that, if two numbers have to one another the ratio which
a square number has to a square number, they are similar
plane numbers.
[Converse of vm. 26]
And it is manifest from these propositions that numbers
which are not similar plane numbers, that is, those which
have not their sides proportional, have not to one another
the ratio which a square number has to a square number.
For, if they have, they will be similar plane numbers:
which is contrary to the hypothesis.
Therefore numbers which are not similar plane numbers
have not to one another the ratio which a square number has
to a square number.]

A scholium to this proposition (Schol. x. No. 62) says categorically that
the theorem proved in it was the discovery of Theaetetus.
If a, b be straight lines, and
a : b = m : n,
where m, n are numbers,
then
a':b' = m':ti ;
and conversely.
