And, as A is to B, so is C to D ;
therefore neither has C to D the ratio which a number has to
a number;
therefore C is incommensurable with D.
[x. 8]
Therefore etc.
I shall henceforth, for the sake of brevity, use symbols for the terms
" commensurable (with)" and " incommensurable (with)" according to the
varieties described in x. Deff. i—4. The symbols are taken from Lorenz
and seem convenient.
Commensurable and commensurable with, in relation to areas, and com­
mensurable in length and commensurable in length with, in relation to straight
lines, will be denoted by .
Commensurable in square only or commensurable in square only with (terms
applicable only to straight lines) will be denoted by
Incommensurable (with), of areas, and incommensurable (with), of straight
lines will be denoted by ^.
Incommensurable in square (with) (a term applicable to straight lines only)
will be denoted by •—.
Suppose a, b, c, d to be four magnitudes such that
a : b = c : d.
Then (1), if a « b,
a : b = m : n, where m, n are integers, fx. 5]

PROPOSITION

I 2.

Magnitudes commensurable with the same magnitude are
commensurable with one another also.
For let each of the magnitudes A, B be commensurable
with C;
I say that A is also commensurable with B.

For, aince A is commensurable with C,
therefore A has to C the ratio which a number has to a
number.
