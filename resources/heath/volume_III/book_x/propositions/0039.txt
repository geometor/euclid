Let it have the ratio which D has to E.
Again, since C is commensurable with B,
therefore C has to B the ratio which a number has to a
number.
[x- 5]
Let it have the ratio which F has to G.
And, given any number of ratios we please, namely the
ratio which D has to E and that which F has to G,
let the numbers H, K, L be taken continuously in the given
ratios ;
[cf. vm. 4]
so that, as D is to E, so is H to K,
and, as F is to G,-so is K to L.
Since, then, as A is to C, so is D to E,
while, as D is to E, so is H to A",
therefore also, as A is to C, so is H to K.
[v. n ]
Again, since, as C is to B, so is F to G,
while, as F is to 6", so is K to Z,
therefore also, as C is to B, so is A to L.
[v. n ]
But also, as A is to C, so is H to A*;
therefore, ex aequali, as ^4 is to B, so is H to Z.
[v. 22]
Therefore A has to
the ratio which a number has to a
number;
therefore A is commensurable with B.
[x. 6]
Therefore etc.
Q. E. D.


We have merely to go through the process of compounding two ratios in
numbers.
a, b each r< c.
Suppose
a : c = m : 11, say,
Therefore
[x. 5]
c : b = p : q, say.
tn : n = mp : np,
Now
p : q = np : nq.
and
a : c = mp : np,
Therefore
c : b = np : nq,
a : b = mp : nq,
whence, ex aequali,
a« .
so that
