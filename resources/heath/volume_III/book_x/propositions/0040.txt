13.

If two magnitudes be commensurable, and the one of them
be incommensurable with any magnitude, the remaining one
will also be incommensurable with the same.
Let A, B be two commensurable magnitudes, and let one
of them, A, be incommensurable with
any other magnitude C;
x
I say that the remaining one, B, will
0
also be incommensurable with C.
B
For, if B is commensurable with C,
while A is also commensurable with B,
A is also commensurable with C.
[x. 12]
But it is also incommensurable with it:
which is impossible.
Therefore B is not commensurable with C;
therefore it is incommensurable with it.
Therefore etc.

LEMMA.

Given two unequal straight lines, to find by what square the
square on the greater is greater than the square on the less.
Let AB, C be the given two unequal straight lines, and
let AB be the greater of them;
thus it is required to find by what
square the square on AB is greater
than the square on C.
Let the semicircle ADB be de­
scribed on AB,
and let AD be fitted into it equal to C;
[iv. 1]
let DB be joined.
It is then manifest that the angle ADB is right, [m. 31]
and that the square on AB is greater than the square on
AD, that is, C, by the square on DB.
[1. 47]
Similarly also, if two straight lines be given, the straight
line the square on which is equal to the sum of the squares
on them is found in this manner.
