Therefore, as the squares on E, B are to the square on
B, so are the squares on D, F to the square on D;
therefore, separando, as the square on E is to the square on
B, so is the square on F to the square on D ;
[v. 17]
3° therefore also, as E is to B, so is F to D ;

[vi. 22]

therefore, inversely, as B is to E, so is D to F.
But, as A is to B, so also is C to D ;
therefore, ex aequali, as ^4 is to E, so is C to F.

[v. 22]

Therefore, if A is commensurable with E, C is also com35 mensurable with F,
and, if A is incommensurable with E, C is also incommen­
surable with F.

Q. E. D.

3, 5, 8, 10. Euclid speaks of the square on the first (third) being greater than the square
on the second (fourth) by the square on a straight line commensurable (incommensurable)
" w i t h itself (iavr^), and similarly in all like phrases throughout the Book. For clearness'
sake I substitute " the first," " the third," or whatever it may be, for " itself" in these cases.
v

Suppose a, b, c, d to be straight lines such that
a : b=c: d
(1).
It follows [vi. 22] that
a : b =c : d
(2).
In order to prove that, convertendo,
a : (a - b ) = c : (c - d )
Euclid has to use a somewhat roundabout method owing to the absence of a
convertendo proposition in his Book v. (which omission Simson supplied by
his Prop. E).
It follows from (2) that
{(a - b ) + b \:b = {(c -d ) + d*) : d\
whence, separando,
(a - b ) ; b =(c — d ) : d ,
[v. 17]
and, inversely,
b : (a - b ) = d : (c — d ).
From this and (2), ex aequali,
a : (a -b ) = c :(c -d ).

If a « •Jd' — b , we may put J a- — b = ka, where k is of the form m/n
and m, n are integers. And if \'a - /<* = ka, it follows in this case that
s/F- d = kc.
