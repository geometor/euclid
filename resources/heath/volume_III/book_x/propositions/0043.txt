PROPOSITION 

15.

If two commensurable magnitudes be added together, the
whole will also be commensurable with each of them ; and, if
the whole be commensurable with one of them, the original
magnitudes will also be commensurable.
For let the two commensurable magnitudes AB, BC be
added together;
I say that the whole A C is also
1
commensurable with each of the
magnitudes AB, BC.
For, since AB, BC are commensurable, some magnitude
will measure them.
Let it measure them, and let it be D.
Since then D measures AB, BC, it will also measure the
whole AC.
But it measures AB, BC also ;
therefore D measures AB, BC, AC;
therefore AC is commensurable with each of the magnitudes
AB, BC.

Next, let AC be commensurable with AB;
I say that AB, BC are also commensurable.
For, since AC, AB are commensurable, some magnitude
will measure them.
Let it measure them, and let it be D.
Since then D measures CA, AB, it will also measure the
remainder BC.
But it measures AB also ;
therefore D will measure AB, BC;
therefore AB, BC are commensurable.
[x. Def. 1]
Therefore etc.
(1) If a, b be any two commensurable magnitudes, they are of the form
mc, nc, where c is a common measure of a, b and m, n some integers.
It follows that
a + b = (m + n)c:
therefore (a + b), being measured by c, is commensurable with both a and b.
(2) If a + b is commensurable with either a or b, say a, we may put
a + b = mc, a = nc, where c is a common measure of (a + b), a, and m, ware
integers.
Subtracting, we have
/' = (m— n) c,
whence /' « a.
