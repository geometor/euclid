PROPOSITION

I 6.

If two incommensurable magnitudes be added together, the
whole will also be incommensurable with each of them ; and, if
the whole be incommensurable with one of them, the original
magnitudes will also be incommensurable.
For let the two incommensurable magnitudes AB, BC be
added together;
I say that the whole AC is also incommensurable
A
with each of the magnitudes AB, BC.
°
For, if CA, AB are not incommensurable, some
magnitude will measure them.
Let it measure them, if possible, and let it be D.
.
Since then D measures CA, AB,
therefore it will also measure the remainder BC.
But it measures AB also ;
c
therefore D measures AB, BC.
Therefore AB, BC are commensurable ;
but they were also, by hypothesis, incommensurable:
which is impossible.
Therefore no magnitude will measure CA, AB;
therefore CA, AB are incommensurable.
[x. Def. i]
Similarly we can prove that AC, CB are also incom­
mensurable.
Therefore AC is incommensurable with each of the magni­
tudes AB, BC.
B

Next, let AC be incommensurable with one of the magni­
tudes AB, BC.
First, let it be incommensurable with AB;
I say that AB, BC are also incommensurable.
For, if they are commensurable, some magnitude will
measure them.
Let it measure them, and let it be D.
Since then D measures AB, BC.
therefore it will also measure the whole AC.
But it measures AB also ;
therefore D measures CA, AB.
