Therefore CA, AB are commensurable ;
but they were also, by hypothesis, incommensurable :
which is impossible.
Therefore no magnitude will measure AB, BC;
therefore AB, BC are incommensurable.

LEMMA.

If to any straight line there be applied a parallelogram
deficient by a square figure, the applied parallelogram is equal
to the rectangle contained by the segments of the straight line
resulting from the application.
For let there be applied to the straight line AB the
parallelogram AD deficient by the
square figure DB;

j—
I say that AD is equal to the rectangle
contained by A C, CB.

This is indeed at once manifest;
for, since DB is a square,
DC is equal to CB ;
and AD is the rectangle AC, CD, that is, the rectangle AC,
(

CB.
Therefore etc.
If a be the given straight line, and x the side of the square by which the
applied rectangle is to be deficient, the rectangle is equal to ax - x , which is
of course equal to x (a — x). The rectangle may be written xy, where
* + y = a. Given the area x(a-x), or xy (where x+y = a), two different
applications will give rectangles equal to this area, the sides of the defect
being x or a - x (x or y) respectively; but the second mode of expression
shows that the rectangles do not differ in form but only in position.

17.

If there be two unequal straight lines, and to the greater
there be applied a parallelogram equal to the fourth part of
the square on the less and deficient by a square figure, and if
it divide it into parts which are commensurable in length, then
the square on the greater will be greater than the square on
the less by the square on a straight line commensurable with
the greater.
And, if the square on the greater be greater than the square
on the less by the square on a straight line commensurable with
