io the greater, and if there be applied to the greater a parallelogram
equal to the fourth part of the square on the less and deficient
by a square figure, it will divide it into parts which are com­
mensurable in length.
Let A, BC be two unequal straight lines, of which BC is
15 the greater,
and let there be applied to BC a parallel*
ogram equal to the fourth part of the
square on the less, A, that is, equal to |
—j
the square on the half of A, and deficient i
20 by a square figure. Let this be the g
JF E ci c
rectangle BD, DC,
[cf. Lemma]
and let BD be commensurable in length with DC;
I say that the square on BC is greater than the square on A
by the square on a straight line commensurable with BC.
25
For let BC be bisected at the point E,
and let EE be made equal to DE.
Therefore the remainder DC is equal to BE.
And, since the straight line BC has been cut into equal
parts at E, and into unequal parts at D,
3° therefore the rectangle contained by BD, DC, together with
the square on ED, is equal to the square on EC;
[n. 5]
And the same is true of their quadruples ;
therefore four times the rectangle BD, DC, together with
four times the square on DE, is equal to four times the square
35 on EC.
But the square on A is equal to four times the rectangle

BD,

DC;

and the square on DE is equal to four times the square on
DE, for DE is double of DE.
40
And the square on BC is equal to four times the square
on EC, for again BC is double of CE.
Therefore the squares on A, DE are equal to the square
on BC,
so that the square on BC is greater than the square on A by
45 the square on DE.
It is to be proved that BC is also commensurable with DE.
Since BD is commensurable in length with DC,
therefore BC is also commensurable in length with CD. [x. 15]
