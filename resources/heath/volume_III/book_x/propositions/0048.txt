with a given number of units of length be explained. In a purely geometrical
solution the distinction between commensurable and incommensurable roots
has no point, because each can equally easily be represented by straight lines.
On the other hand, on the assumption that the numerical solution of quadratic
equations was an important part of the system of the Greek geometers,
the distinction between the cases where the roots are commensurable and
incommensurable respectively with a given length or unit becomes of great
importance. Since the Greeks had no means of expressing what we call an
irrational number, the case of an equation with incommensurable roots could
only be represented by them geometrically; and the geometrical representations
had to serve instead of what we can express by formulae involving surds.
Euclid proves in this proposition and the next that, x being determined
from the equation
x (a-x)

x, (a-x)
are commensurable in length when Ja'-e',
a are so, and incom­
mensurable in length when Ja* — &*, a are incommensurable; and conversely.
Observe the similarity of his proof to our algebraical method of solving
the equation, a being represented in the figure by B C , and x by CD,

We have to prove in this proposition
(1) that, if*, (a-x) are commensurable in length, so are a, Ja* — P ,
(2) that, if a, Ja"^
are commensurable in length, so are x , (a — x),
(1) To prove that a, a - 2X are commensurable in length Euclid employs
several successive steps, thus.
