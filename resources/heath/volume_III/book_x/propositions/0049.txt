It is often more convenient to use the symmetrical form of equation in
this and similar cases, viz.

x +y - a
The result with this mode of expression is that
(1) if x
then a « s/a'-P; and
(2) if a « -Ja'-if, then x ~ y.
The truth of the proposition is even easier to see in this case, since
(x-yy = (a*-P).

PROPOSITION

18.

If there be two unequal straight lines, and to the greater
there be applied a parallelogram equal to the fourth part of
the square on the less and deficient by a square figure, and
if it divide it into parts which are incommensurable, the square
on the greater will be greater than the square on tite less by
the square on a straight line incommensurable with the greater.
And, if the square on the greater be greater than the square
on the less by the square on a straight line incommensurable
with the greater, and if there be applied to the greater a
parallelogram equal to the fourth part of the square on the
less and deficient by a square figure, it divides it into parts
which are incommensurable.
Let A, BC be two unequal straight lines, of which BC is
the greater,
and to BC let there be applied a parallelogram equal
to the fourth part of the square on the less, A, and
deficient by a square figure. Let this be the rectB

and let BD be incommensurable in length with DC;
I say that the square on BC is greater than the
square on A by the square on a straight line incommensurable with BC.

For, with the same construction as before, we can prove
similarly that the square on BC is greater than the square on
A by the square on FD.
It is to be proved that BC is incommensurable in length
with DF.
