Since BD is incommensurable in length with DC,
therefore BC is also incommensurable in length with CD.
[x. ,6]

But DC is commensurable with the sum of BF, DC; [x. 6]
therefore BC is also incommensurable with the sum of BF,

DC;

[x. i ]

so XhaxBC is also incommensurable in length with the remainder
FD.
[x. its]
And the square on BC is greater than the square on A
by the square on FD ;
therefore the square on BC is greater than the square on A
by the square on a straight line incommensurable with BC.
Again, let the square on BC be greater than the square on
A by the square on a straight line incommensurable with BC,
and let there be applied to BC a. parallelogram equal to the
fourth part of the square on A and deficient by a square figure.
Let this be the rectangle BD, DC.
It is to be proved that BD is incommensurable in length
with DC.
For, with the same construction, we can prove similarly
that the square on BC is greater than the square on A by
the square on FD.
But the square on BC is greater than the square on A by
the square on a straight line incommensurable with BC;
therefore BC is incommensurable in length with FD,
so that BC is also incommensurable with the remainder, the
sum of BF, DC.
[x. 16]
But the sum of BF, DC is commensurable in length with

DC;

[x. 6]

therefore BC is also incommensurable in length with DC,
[x. ij]
so that, separando, BD is also incommensurable in length with

DC.

[x. 16]

Therefore etc.
With the same notation as before, we have to prove in this proposition that
(1) if (a - x), x are incommensurable in length, so are a, Ja* - V, and
(2) if a, Ja>-i> are incommensurable in length, so are (a - x), x.
Or, with the equations
