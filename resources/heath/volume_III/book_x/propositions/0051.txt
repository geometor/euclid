(1) if x y, then a ^ Ja' — P, and
(2) if a yj sja - P, then x ^ y.
The steps are exactly the same as shown under (1) and (2) of the last
note, with ^ instead of , except only in the lines "x <-> 2 * " and "2x x "
which are unaltered, while, in the references, x. 13, 16 take the place of x.
12, 15 respectively.

[LEMMA.

Since it has been proved that straight lines commen­
surable in length are always commensurable in square also,
while those commensurable in square are not always com­
mensurable in length also, but can of course be either
commensurable or incommensurable in length, it is manifest
that, if any straight line be commensurable in length with a
given rational straight line, it is called rational and commen­
surable with the other not only in length but in square also,
since straight lines commensurable in length are always
commensurable in square also.
But, if any straight line be commensurable in square with
a given rational straight line, then, if it is also commensurable
in length with it, it is called in this case also rational and
commensurable with it both in length and in square; but, if
again any straight line, being commensurable in square with a
given rational straight line, be incommensurable in length
with it, it is called in this case also rational but commensurable
in square only.]
PROPOSITION

19.

The rectangle contained by rational straight lines commen­
surable in length is rational.
For let the rectangle AC be contained by the rational
straight lines AB, BC commensurable in
length;
I say that A C is rational.
For on AB let the square AD be de­
scribed ;
therefore AD is rational.
[x. Def. 4]
And, since AB is commensurable in
length with BC,
while AB is equal to BD,
therefore BD is commensurable in length with BC.
