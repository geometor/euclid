If a rational area be applied to a rational straight line, it
produces as breadth a straight line rational and commensurable
in length with the straight line to which it is applied.
For let the rational area A C be applied to AB, a straight
line once more rational in any of the aforesaid
ways, producing BC as breadth ;
I say that BC is rational and commensurable in
length with BA.
For on AB let the square AD be described ;
therefore AD is rational.
[x. Def. 4]
But AC is also rational;
therefore DA is commensurable with AC.
And, as DA is to AC, so is DB to BC.

1 herefore DB is also commensurable with BC;
[x. n ]
and DB is equal to BA ;
therefore AB is also commensurable with BC.
But AB is rational;
therefore BC is also rational and commensurable in length
with AB.
Therefore etc.
The converse of the last. If p is a rational straight line, any rational area
is of the form hp . If this be "applied" to p, the breadth is kp commensurable
in length with p and therefore rational. We should reach the same result if
we applied the area to another rational straight line o-. The breadth is then

The rectangle contained by rational straight lines commen­
surable in square only is irrational, and the side of the square
equal to it is irrational. Let the latter be called medial.
For let the rectangle AC be contained by the rational
straight lines AB, BC commensurable in square only ;
