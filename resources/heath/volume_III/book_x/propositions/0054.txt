I say that AC is irrational, and the side of the square equal
to it is irrational;
and let the latter be called medial.
For on AB let the square AD be described ;
therefore AD is rational.
[x. Def. 4]
And, since AB is incommensurable in length
with BC,
for by hypothesis they are commensurable in
square only,
while AB is equal to BD,
therefore DB is also incommensurable in length with BC.
And, as DB is to BC, so is AD to AC;
[vi. 1]
therefore DA is incommensurable with AC.
[x. 11]
But DA is rational;
therefore AC is irrational,
so that the side of the square equal to A C is also irrational.

Ana let the latter be called medial.
Q. E. D.


A medial straight line, now defined for the first time, is so called because
it is a mean proportional between two rational straight lines commensurable
in square only. Such straight lines can be denoted by p, p Jk. A medial
straight line is therefore of the form Jp'Jk or k*p. Euclid's proof that this is
irrational is equivalent to the following. Take p, pjk commensurable in
square only, so that they are incommensurable in length.
Now
p : pjk = p : p Jk,
whence [x. 11] p Jk is incommensurable with p and therefore irrational
[x. Def. 4], so that Jp'Jk is also irrational [ibid.].
A medial straight line may evidently take either of the forms JaJB or
si AB, where of course B is not of the form k'A.

LEMMA.

If there be two straight lines, then, as the first is to the
second, so is the square on the first
to the rectangle contained by the
two straight lines.
Let FE, EG be two straight
lines.
I say that, as FE is to EG, so is the square on FE to
the rectangle FE, EG.
