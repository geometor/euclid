For on FE let the square DF be described,
and let GD be completed.
Since then, as FE is to EG, so is FD to Z?^,
[vi. i]
and FD is the square on FE,
and Z^G the rectangle DE, EG, that is, the rectangle FE, EG,
therefore, as FE is to EG, so is the square on FE to the
rectangle FE, EG.
Similarly also, as the rectangle GE, EE is to the square
on EE, that is, as GD is to FD, so is GE to EE.

PROPOSITION

22.

The square on a medial straight line, if applied to a
rational straight line, produces as breadth a straight line
rational and incommensurable in length with that to which it
is applied.
Let A be medial and CB rational,
and let a rectangular area BD equal to the square on A be
applied to BC, producing CD as
breadth;
I say that CD is rational and incom­
mensurable in length with CB.

For, since A is medial, the square
on it is equal to a rectangular area
contained by rational straight lines
commensurable in square only.

Let the square on it be equal to GE.
But th( square on it is also equal to BD;
therefore BD is equal to GE.
But it is also equiangular with it;
and in e q u a l and equiangular parallelograms the sides about
the e q u a l angles are reciprocally proportional;
[vi. 14]
therefore, proportionally, as BC is to EG, so is EE to CD.
Therefore also, as the square on BC is to the square on
EG, so is the square on EE to the square on CD.
