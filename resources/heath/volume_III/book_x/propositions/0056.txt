But the square on CB is commensurable with the square
on EG, for each of these straight lines is rational;
therefore the square on EE is also commensurable with the
square on CD.
[x. n ]
But the square on EE is rational;
therefore the square on CD is also rational;
[x. Def. 4]
therefore CD is rational.
And, since EE is incommensurable in length with EG,
for they are commensurable in square only,
and, as EE is to EG, so is the square on EE to the rectangle
EE, EG,

[Lemma]

therefore the square on EE is incommensurable with the
rectangle EE, EG.
[x. n ]
But the square on CD is commensurable with the square
on EE, for the straight lines are rational in square ;
and the rectangle DC, CB is commensurable with the rect­
angle EE, EG, for they are equal to the square on A ;
therefore the square on CD is also incommensurable with the
rectangle DC, CB.
[x. 13]
But, as the square on CD is to the rectangle DC, CB, so
is DC to CB ;

[Urama]

therefore DC is incommensurable in length with CB.
[x. 11J
Therefore CD is rational and incommensurable in length
with CB.
Q. E. D.


Our algebraical notation makes the result of this proposition almost selfevident. We have seen that the square of a medial straight line is of the form
Jk.p*. If we "apply" this area to another rational straight line <r, the
P

breadth is "* ' .
cr

This is equal to * ^

p

. <r = Jk. jj <r, where m, n are integers. The latter

straight line, which we may express, if we please, in the form Jk'. <r, is clearly
commensurable with <r in square only, and therefore rational but incom­
mensurable in length with <r.
Euclid's proof, necessarily longer, is in two parts.
Suppose that the rectangle Jk. p* = <r. x.
Then (1)
<r :p= Jk.p:x,
[vi. 14]
whence
o- : p* = kp*: x*.

But o- « p , and therefore kp »* * .
