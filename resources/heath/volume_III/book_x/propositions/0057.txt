And kp is rational,
therefore x , and therefore x, is rational.
(2) Since Jk. p «- p, Jk.p p.
But [Lemma]
Jk. p: p = kp : Jk. p ,
whence
kp ^ Jk. p .
But Jk.p = ax, and kp « x (from above);
therefore
x ^<rx;
and, since ar : ax = x: <r,
x J a.

PROPOSITION

[* 13]

[Lemma]

23.

A straight line commensurable with a medial straight line
is medial.
Let A be medial, and let B be commensurable with A ;
I say that B is also medial.
For let a rational straight line CD
be set out,
and to CD let the rectangular area CE
equal to the square on A be applied,
producing ED as breadth ;
therefore ED is rational and incommen­
surable in length with CD.
[x. 22]
And let the rectangular area CF
D
F
equal to the square on B be applied to
CD, producing DE as breadth.
Since then A is commensurable with B,
the square on A is also commensurable with the square on B.
But EC is equal to the square on A,
*
and CF is equal to the square on B;
therefore EC is commensurable with CF.
[VI. I ]
And, as EC is to CF, so is ED to DE;
therefore ED is commensurable in length with DE.
[x. 1 1 ]
But ED is rational and incommensurable in length with

DC;
therefore DE is also rational [x. Def. 3] and incommensurable
in length with DC.
[x. 13]
Therefore CD, DE are rational and commensurable in
square only.
