But the straight line the square on which is equal to the
rectangle contained by rational straight lines commensurable
in square only is medial;
[x. 21]
therefore the side of the square equal to the rectangle CD,
DF is medial.
And B is the side of the square equal to the rectangle

CD, DF;
therefore B is medial.
PORISM.
From this it is manifest that an area commen­
surable with a medial area is medial.
[And in the same way as was explained in the case of
rationals [Lemma following x. 18] it follows, as regards medials,
that a straight line commensurable in length with a medial
straight line is called medial and commensurable with it not
only in length but in square also, since, in general, straight
lines commensurable in length are always commensurable in
square also.
But, if any straight line be commensurable in square with
a medial straight line, then, if it is also commensurable in
length with it, the straight lines are called, in this case too,
medial and commensurable in length and in square, but, if in
square only, they are called medial straight lines commen­
surable in square only.]

As explained in the bracketed passage following this proposition, a straight
line commensurable with a medial straight line in square only, as well as a
straight line commensurable with it in length, is medial.
Algebraical notation shows this easily.
If $p be the given straight line,
is a straight line commensurable
in length with it and Jk. $p a straight line commensurable with it in square
only.
But Ap and Jk. p are both rational [x. Def. 3] and therefore can be
expressed by p', and we thus arrive at k^p, which is clearly medial.
Euclid's proof amounts to the following.
Apply both the areas Jk. p* and X ' ^ . p (or kjk. p ) to a rational
straight line <r.

The breadths Jk. ^ and k'Jk . 8- ^or kjk . $J are in the ratio of the

areas Jk. p and k Jk. p (or kjk. p ) themselves and are therefore com­
mensurable.
Now [x. 22] Jk. — is rational but incommensurable with <r.
Therefore k'Jk . — for kjk . —\ is so also;
