But x " \x, so that x r> x. kx.
Now x is medial [x. 2 1 ] ;
therefore x a A * is also medial.
[x. 23, Por.]
We may of course write two medial straight lines commensurable in length
in the forms mk^p, nk^p; and these may either be mJaJB, nJaJB, or
mXJAB, njAB.

PROPOSITION

25.

The rectangle contained by medial straight lines commen­
surable in square only is either rational or medial.
For let the rectangle AC be contained by the medial
straight lines AB, BC which are
commensurable in square only ;
I say that AC is either rational
or medial.
For on AB, BC let the
D
B
squares AD, BE be described ;
therefore each of the squares
AD, BE is medial.
Let a rational straight line
EG be set out,
to EG let there be applied the rectangular parallelogram GH
equal to AD, producing EH as breadth,
to HM let there be applied the rectangular parallelogram MK
equal to AC, producing HK as breadth,
and further to KN let there be similarly applied NL equal to
BE, producing KL as breadth ;
therefore EH, HK, KL are in a straight line.
Since then each of the squares AD, BE is medial,
and AD is equal to GH, and BE to NL,
therefore each of the rectangles GH, NL is also medial.
And they are applied to the rational straight line EG;
therefore each of the straight lines EH, KL is rational and
incommensurable in length with EG.
[x. 22]
And, since AD is commensurable with BE,
therefore GH is also commensurable with NL.
And, as GH is to NL, so is EH to KL ;
[vi. , ]
[x. „ ]
therefore EH is commensurable in length with KL.
