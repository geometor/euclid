Therefore FH, KL are rational straight lines commen­
surable in length;
therefore the rectangle FH, KL is rational.
[x. 19]
And, since DB is equal to BA, and OB to BC,
therefore, as DB is to BC, so is AB to BO.
But, as DB is to BC, so is DA to ^4C,
[ v i . 1]
and,

as

AB

is to

BO,

so

is AC

to

C<9

;

[*'</.]

therefore, as DA is to AC, so\% AC to C"(9.
But AD is equal to G77,
to l i f t ! and CO to NL ;
therefore, as 6 7 / is to MK, so is MK to iVZ. ;
therefore also, as FH is to HK, so is / / A ' to KL ; [vi. 1, v. 11]
therefore the rectangle FH, KL is equal to the square on HK.
[vi. 17]

But the rectangle FH, KL is rational;
therefore the square on HK is also rational.
Therefore HK is rational.
And, if it is commensurable in length with FG,
HN is rational;
[x. 19]
but, if it is incommensurable in length with FG,
KH, HM are rational straight lines commensurable in square
only, and therefore HN is medial.
[x. 21]
Therefore HN is either rational or medial.
But HN is equal to AC;
therefore AC is either rational or medial.
Therefore etc.
Two medial straight lines commensurable in square only are of the form
£p, Jk. k^p
The rectangle contained by them is Jk. k^p . Now this is in general
medial; but, if Jk = k Jk, the rectangle is kk'p , which is rational.
Euclid's argument is as follows. Let us, for convenience, put x for $p, sc
that the medial straight lines are x, Jk . x.
Form the areas x , x. Jk. x, kx ,
and let these be respectively equal to au, av, aw, where a is a rational
straight line.
Since x , kx are medial areas,
so are au, aw,
whence u, w are respectively rational and ~- a.
