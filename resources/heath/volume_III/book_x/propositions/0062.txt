Therefore, u, w being both rational, uw is rational
Now
x : Jk.x*= Jk.x'-.Xx*
or
au : av = av : aw,
so that
u:v = v:w,
and
uw = v".
Hence, by (2), v , and therefore v, is rational
Now (o) if v ^ a, av or l\ . x is rational;

PROPOSITION

26.

4 medial area does not exceed a medial area by a rational
area.
For, if possible, let the medial area AB exceed the medial
area AC by the rational area

DB,
and let a rational straight line
EF be set out;
to EF let there be applied the
rectangular parallelogram FH
equal to AB, producing EH as
breadth,
and let the rectangle FG equal to AC be subtracted ;
therefore the remainder B>> is equal to the remainder KH.
But DB is rational;
therefore KH is also rational.
Since, then, each of the rectangles AB, AC is medial,
and AB is equal to FH, and AC to FG,
therefore each of the rectangles FH, FG is also medial.
And they are applied to the rational straight line EF;
therefore each of the straight lines HE, EG is rational and
incommensurable in length with EF.
[x. 22]
And, since \DB is rational and is equal to KH,
therefore] KH is [also] rational;
and it is applied to the rational straight line EF;
