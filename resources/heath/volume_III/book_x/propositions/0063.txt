therefore GH is rational and commensurable in length with
[x. 20]
But EG is also rational, and is incommensurable in length
with EF;
therefore EG is incommensurable in length with GH.
[x. 13]
And, as EG is to GH, so is the square on EG to the
rectangle EG, GH;
therefore the square on EG is incommensurable with the
rectangle EG, GH.
[x. n ]
But the squares on EG, GH are commensurable with the
square on EG, for both are rational;
and twice the rectangle EG, GH is commensurable with the
rectangle EG, GH, for it is double of it;
[x. 6]
therefore the squares on EG, GH are incommensurable with
twice the rectangle EG, GH;
[x. 13]
therefore also the sum of the squares on EG, GH and twice
the rectangle EG, GH, that is, the square on EH [11. 4], is
incommensurable with the squares on EG, GH.
[x. 16]
But the squares on EG, GH are rational;
therefore the square on EH is irrational.
[x. Def. 4]
Therefore EH is irrational.
But it is also rational:
which is impossible.
Therefore etc.

EF.

Q. E. D.


" Apply " the two given medial areas to one and the same rational straight
line p. They can then be written in the form p 1 k^p, p . X^p.
The difference is then (Jk- Jfyp ;
I
proposition asserts that this
cannot be rational, i.e. (Jk - JX.) cannot be equal to k'. Cf. the proposition
corresponding to this in algebraical text-books.
To make Euclid's proof clear we will put x for k^p and y for K^p.
Suppose
p (x -y) = pz,
and, if possible, let pz be rational, so that z must be rational and « p ...(1).
Since px, py are medial,
x ax\Ay are respectively rational and w p
(2).
From (1) and (2),
y ^ z.
Now
y:z=y :yz,
so that
jr* v yz.
