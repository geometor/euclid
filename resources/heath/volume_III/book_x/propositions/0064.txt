PROPOSITION

27.

To find medial straight lines commensurable in square only
•which contain a rational rectangle.
Let two rational straight lines A, B commensurable in
square only be set out;
let C be taken a mean proportional between

A,B,

'

[v.. 13]

and let it he contrived that,
as A is to B, so is C to D.
[vi. 12]
Then, since A, B are rational and com­
mensurable in square only,
;
the rectangle A, B, that is, the square on C
[vi 17], is medial.
[x. 21]
Therefore C is medial.
[x. 21]
And since, as A is to B, so is C to D,
and A, B are commensurable in square only,
therefore C, D are also commensurable in square only. [x. n ]
And C is medial;
therefore D is also medial.
[x. 23, addition]
Therefore C, D are medial and commensurable in square
only.
I say that they also contain a rational rectangle.
For since, as A is to B, so is C to D,
therefore, alternately, as A is to C, so is B to D.
[v. 16]
But, as A is to C, so is C to B;
therefore also, as C is to B, so is B to D ;
therefore the rectangle C, D is equal to the square on B.
