But the square on B is rational;
therefore the rectangle C, D is also rational.
Therefore medial straight lines commensurable in square
only have been found which contain a rational rectangle.
Q. E. D.


Euclid takes two rational straight lines commensurable in square only, say
P, * v

Find the mean proportional, i.e. £p.
Take x such that
p : k-p = k^p ; x
This gives x — $p,
and the lines required are k^p, $p.
For (a) k*p is medial.
And (/3), by (1), since p ~- k^p,
k^p ~- $p,
whence [addition to x. 23], since k^p is medial,

(1).

k*p is also medial.
The medial straight lines thus found may take either of the forms

To find medial straight lines commensurable in square only
which contain a medial rectangle.
Let the rational straight lines A, B, C commensurable in
square only be set out;
let D be taken a mean proportional between A, B,
[vi. 13]
and let it be contrived that,
as B is to C, so is D to E.

Since A, B are rational straight lines commensurable in
square only,
therefore the rectangle A, B, that is, the square on D [vi. 17],
is medial.
