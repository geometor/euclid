Therefore D is medial.
[x. 21]
And since E, C are commensurable in square only,
and, as B is to C, so is D to E,
therefore D, E are also commensurable in square only. [x. n ]
But D is medial;
therefore E is also medial.

[x. 23, addition]

Therefore D, E are medial straight lines commensurable
in square only.
I say next that they also contain a medial rectangle.
For since, as B is to C, so is D to E,
therefore, alternately, as B is to D, so is C to E.
[v. 16]
But, as B is to D, so is D to A ;
therefore also, as D is to A, so is C to E;
therefore the rectangle A, C is equal to the rectangle D, E.
[vi. 16]

But the rectangle A, C is medial ;
[x. 21]
therefore the rectangle D, E is also medial.
Therefore medial straight lines commensurable in square
only have been found which contain a medial rectangle.
Q. E. D.


Euclid takes three straight lines commensurable in square only, i.e. of the
form p, k^p, X^p, and proceeds as follows.
Take the mean proportional to p, k^p, i.e. kip.
Then take x such that
k*p : X*p = k^p : x
(r),
so that x =
kip, X^p/ki are the required medial straight lines.
For kip is medial.
Now, by (1), since k^p A^p,
/r^p «- x,
whence x is also medial [x. 23, addition], while «- kip.
Next, by (1),

X*p 1 x = k*p : kip
= kip:p,

whence

x. kip = XV, which is medial.

The straight lines kip, X^p/^ of course take different forms according as
the original straight lines are of the forms (1) a, JB, JC, (2) J A, JB, JC,
(3) J A, b, JC, and (4) J A, JB, c.
