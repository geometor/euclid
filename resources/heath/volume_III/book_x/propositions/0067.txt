To find two square numbers such that their sum is also
square.
Let two numbers AB, BC be set out, and let them be
either both even or both odd.
Then since, whether an even
A
D
c
B
number is subtracted from an
even number, or an odd number from an odd number, the
remainder is even,
[ix. 24, 26]
therefore the remainder A C is even.
Let AC be bisected at D.
Let AB, BC also be either similar plan„ numbers, or
square numbers, which are themselves also similar plane
numbers.
Now the product of AB, BC together with the square on
CD is equal to the square on BD.
[11. 6]
And the product of AB, BC is square, inasmuch as it
was proved that, if two similar plane numbers by multiplying
one another make some number the product is square, [ix. 1]
Therefore two square numbers, the product of AB, BC,
and the square on CD, have been found which, when added
together, make the square on BD.
And it is manifest that two square numbers, the square
on BD and the square on CD, have again been found such
that their difference, the product of AB, BC, is a square,
whenever AB, BC are similar plane numbers.
But when they are not similar plane numbers, two square
numbers, the square on BD and the square on DC, have been
found such that their difference, the product of AB, BC, is
not square.
Q. E. D.


Euclid's method of forming right-angled triangles in integral numbers,
already alluded to in the note on 1. 47, is as follows.
Take two similar plane numbers, e.g. mnp , tnng , ivhich are either both even
or both odd, so that their difference is divisible by 2.
