so that the numbers mnpq, ^ (mnp - mnq') satisfy the condition that the sum
of their squares is also a square number.
It is also clear that \ (tnnp* + mnq' ), mnpq are numbers such that the
difference of their squares is also square.

To find two square numbers such that their sum is not
square.
For let the product of AB, BC, as we said, be square,
and CA even,
and let CA be bisected by D.

It is then manifest that the square product of AB, BC
together with the square on CD is equal to the square on BD.
[See Lemma 1]
Let the unit DE be subtracted ;
therefore the product of AB, BC together with the square on
CE is less than the square on BD.
I say then that the square product of AB, BC together
with the square on CE will not be square.
For, if it is square, it is either equal to the square on BE,
or less than the square on BE, but cannot any more be
greater, lest the unit be divided.
First, if possible, let the product of AB, BC together
with the square on CE be equal to the square on BE,
and let GA be double of the unit DE.
Since then the whole A C is double of the whole CD,
and in them AG is double of DE,
therefore the remainder GC is also double of the remainder EC;
therefore GC is bisected by E.
Therefore the product of GB, BC together with the square
on CE is equal to the square on BE.
[it 6]
But the product of AB, BC together with the square on
CE is also, by hypothesis, equal to the square on BE;
