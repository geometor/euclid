therefore the product of GB, BC together with the square on
CE is equal to the product of AB, BC together with the
square on CE.
And, if the common square on CE be subtracted,
it follows that AB is equal to GB:
which is absurd.
Therefore the product of AB, BC together with the square
on CE is not equal to the square on BE.
I say next that neither is it less than the square on BE.
For, if possible, let it be equal to the square on BF,
and let HA be double of DF.
Now it will again follow that HC is double of CF;
so that CH has also been bisected at F,
and for this reason the product of HB, BC together with the
square on EC is equal to the square on BF.
[11. 6]
But, by hypothesis, the product of AB, BC together with
the square on CE is also equal to the square on BF.
Thus the product of HB, BC together with the square
on CF
also be equal to the product of AB, BC together
with the square on CE :
which is absurd.
Therefore the product of AB, BC together with the square
on CE is not less than the square on BE.
And it was proved that neither is it equal to the square
on BE.
Therefore the product of AB, BC together with the square
on CE is not square.
Q. E. D.


We can, of course, write the identity in the note on Lemma 1 above (p. 64)
in the simpler form
, /mp'-mq'\>
(mf + mq'y
mf.mq* + y
J =[

where, as before, mp', mq* are both odd or both even.
Now, says Euclid,
1

mp'. mq + f—

|j ""^ - 1 ) is not a square number.

This is proved by reductio ad absurdum.
