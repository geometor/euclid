and let it be contrived that,
as DC is to CE, so is the square on BA to the square
on AF.
[x. 6, Por.]
Let FB be joined.
Since, as the square on BA is to
the square on AF, so is DC to CE,
therefore the square on BA has to
the square on AF the ratio which the
number DC has to the number CE;

therefore the square on BA is com­
mensurable with the square on AF.
[x. 6]
But the square on AB is rational;
[x. Def. 4]
therefore the square on AF'xs also rational;
[id.]
therefore AFis also rational.
And, since DC has not to CE the ratio which a square
number has to a square number,
neither has the square on BA to the square on AF the ratio
which a square number has to a square number;
therefore AB is incommensurable in length with AF.
[x. 9]
Therefore BA, AF are rational straight lines commen­
surable in square only.
And since, as DC is to CE, so is the square on BA to
the square on AF,
therefore, convertendo, as CD is to DE, so is the square on
AB to the square on BF.
[v. 19, Por., m. 3 1 , 1 . 47]
But CD has to DE the ratio which a square number has
to a square number :
therefore also the square on AB has to the square on BF
the ratio which a square number has to a square number;
therefore AB is commensurable in length with BF.
[x. 9]
And the square on AB is equal to the squares on AF, FB;
therefore the square on AB is greater than the square onAF
by the square on BF commensurable with AB.
Therefore there have been found two rational straight
lines BA, AF commensurable in square only and such that
the square on the greater AB is greater than the square on
the less AF by the square on BF commensurable in length
with AB.
