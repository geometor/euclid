Take a rational straight line p and two numbers m , »' such that (m* - n*)
is not a square.
Take a straight line x such that
m*:m',-n = p*:x'

Then p, ps/i-JP are the straight lines required.
It follows from (1) that
x* « p ,
and x is rational, but
x « p.
By (1), convertendo,
m* :ri' =
p :p -x ,
so that Vp" — x* « p, and in fact = kp.
According as p is of the form a or J A, the straight lines are (1) a, Ja'- P
or (2) J A,

To find two rational straight lines commensurable in square
only and such that the square on the greater is greater than
the square on the less by the square on a straight line incom­
mensurable in length with the greater.
Let there be set out a rational straight line AB,
and two square numbers CE, ED
such that their sum CD is not
square ;

[Lemma 2]

let there be described on AB the
semicircle AFB,
let it be contrived that,
as DC is to CE, so is the square
on BA to the square on AF,
[x. 6, Por.]

and let FB be joined.
Then, in a similar manner to the preceding, we can prove
that BA, AF are rational straight lines commensurable in
square only.
And since, as DC is to CE, so is the square on BA to
the square on AF,
therefore, convertendo, as CD is to DE, so is the square on
AB to the square on BF.
[v. 19, Por., m. 31, 1. 47]
But CD has not to DE the ratio which a square number
has to a square number;
