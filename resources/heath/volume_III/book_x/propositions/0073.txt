therefore neither has the square on AB to the square on BF
the ratio which a square number has to a square number;
therefore AB is incommensurable in length with BF.
[x. 9]
And the square on AB is greater than the square on AF
by the square on FB incommensurable with AB.
Therefore AB, AF are rational straight lines commen­
surable in square only, and the square on AB is greater than
the square on AF by the square on FB incommensurable in
length with AB.

PROPOSITION 

3 1 .

To find two medial straight lines commensurable in square
only, containing a rational rectangle, and such that the square
on the greater is greater than the square on the less by the
square on a straight line commensurable in length with the
greater.
Let there be set out two rational straight lines A, B
commensurable in square only and such that the
square on A, being the greater, is greater than
the square on B the less by the square on a
straight line commensurable in length with A.

And let the square on C be equal to the
rectangle A, B.
Now the rectangle A, B is medial; [x. 21]
therefore the square on C is also medial;
therefore C is also medial.
