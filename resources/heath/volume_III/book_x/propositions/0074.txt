Let the rectangle C, D be equal to the square on B.
Now the square on B is rational;
therefore the rectangle C, D is also rational.
And since, as A is to B, so is the rectangle A, B to the
square on B,
while the square on C is equal to the rectangle A, B,
and the rectangle C, D is equal to the square on B,
therefore, as A is to B, so is the square on C to the rectangle

C, D.
But, as the square on C is to the rectangle C, D, so is C

toD;
therefore also, as A is to B, so is C to D.
But A is commensurable with B in square only ;
therefore C is also commensurable with D in square only. [x. 11]
And C is medial;
therefore D is also medial.
[x. 23, addition]
And since, as A is to B, so is C to D,
and the square on A is greater than the square on B by the
square on a straight line commensurable with A,
therefore also the square on C is greater than the square on
D by the square on a straight line commensurable with C.
[x. 14]
Therefore two medial straight lines C, D, commensurable
in square only and containing a rational rectangle, have been
found, and the square on C is greater than the square on D
by the square on a straight line commensurable in length
with C.
Similarly also it can be proved that the square on C
exceeds the square on D by the square on a straight line
incommensurable with C, when the square on A is greater
than the square on B by the square on a straight line incom­
mensurable with A.

I. Take the rational straight lines commensurable in square only found
in x. 29, i.e. p, p V1 - k .
Take the mean proportional p(i - k*)i and x such that
