For (a) p Vi - k is a medial area, and therefore p ( i -k )^ is a medial
straight line

and x. p (1 - /P)i •= p (1 - A ) and is therefore a rational area.

(f3) p, p (1 - >&)^, p Vi - k , x are straight lines in continued proportion, by
construction.
Therefore
p :p V i - k * = p(1

(This Euclid has to prove in a somewhat roundabout way by means of the
lemma after x. 21 to the effect that a : b = ab : b .)
From (2) it follows [x. 11] that x ~- p (1 - k )i; whence, since p (1 - /fc)^ is
medial, x or p (1 —
is medial also.
(y) From (2), since p, p V i -£* satisfy the remaining condition of the
problem, p(i - k )*, p ( i - krf do so also [x. 14].
According as p is of the form a or J A, the straight lines take the forms

PROPOSITION

32.

To find two medial straight lines commensurable in square
only, containing a medial rectangle, and such that the square
on the greater is greater than the square on the less by the
square on a straight line commensurable with the greater.
