Let there be set out three rational straight lines A, B, C
commensurable in square only, and such that the square on A
is greater than the square on C by the square on a straight
line commensurable with A,
[x. 29]
and let the square on D be equal to the rectangle A, B.
A
D
B
E
C

Therefore the square on D is medial;
therefore D is also medial.
[x- 21]
Let the rectangle D, E be equal to the rectangle B, C.
Then since, as the rectangle A, B is to the rectangle B, C,
so is A to 0,
while the square on D is equal to the rectangle A, B,
and the rectangle D, E is equal to the rectangle B, C,
therefore, as A is to C, so is the square on D to the rectangle

D, E.
But, as the square on D is to the rectangle D, E, so is D

toE;
therefore also, as A is to C, so is D to E.
But A is commensurable with C in square only ;
therefore D is also commensurable with E in square only. [x. 11]
But D is medial;
therefore E is also medial.
[x. 23, addition]
And, since, as A is to C, so is D to E,
while the square on A is greater than the square on C by
the square on a straight line commensurable with A,
therefore also the square on D will be greater than the square
on E by the square on a straight line commensurable with D.
[x. 14]

I say next that the rectangle D, E is also medial.
For, since the rectangle B, C is equal to the rectangle D, E,
while the rectangle B, C is medial,
[x. 21]
therefore the rectangle D, E is also medial.
Therefore two medial straight lines D, E, commensurable
in square only, and containing a medial rectangle, have been
found such that the square on the greater is greater than the
