square on the less by the square on a straight line commen­
surable with the greater.
Similarly again it can be proved that the square on D
is greater than the square on E by the square on a straight
line incommensurable with D, when the square on A is
greater than the square on C by the square on a straight line
incommensurable with A.

I. Euclid takes three straight lines of the form p, p JX, p v 1 - k*,
takes the mean proportional pX.1 between the first two
(i),
and then finds x such that
pki-.pXt^pJi^JP-.x
(2),
whence x ~ pX^ >Ji - k*,
1

and the straight lines pA^ pX^ Ji — k satisfy the given conditions.
Now (o) X* is medial.
P

(ft) We have, from (1) and (2),
p:p J1-P

= pXi-.x

whence x ~- pX^; and x is therefore medial and

(3),
pA*.

(y) x . pA* = p JX . p V i - k>.
But the latter is medial;

[x. 21]

therefore x. pA^, or pA^ . pA^ V1 - A* is medial.
Lastly (8) p, p Vi — k* have the remaining property in the enunciation;
therefore pA^, pA^ Ji — & have it also.

(Euclid has not the assistance of symbols to prove the proportion (3) above.
He therefore uses the lemmas ab : be = a : c and d : de = d: e to deduce from
the relations
ab = /P I
and
d:b = e:e)
that
a:c = d:e.)

The straight lines pA^, pA^Ji—k may take any of the following forms
according as the straight lines first taken are
