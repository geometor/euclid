II. If the other conditions are the same, but the square on the first
medial straight line is to exceed the square on the second by the square on a
straight line incommensurable with the first, we begin with the three straight
lines p, p J\,

LEMMA.

Let ABC be a right-angled triangle having the angle A
right, and let the perpendicular AD be
drawn ;
I say that the rectangle CB, BD is
equal to the square on BA,
the rectangle BC, CD equal to the
square on CA,
the rectangle BD, DC equal to the square on AD,
and, further, the rectangle BC, AD equal to the rectangle

BA, AC.
