And first that the rectangle CB, BD is equal to the square
on BA.
For, since in a right-angled triangle AD has been drawn
from the right angle perpendicular to the base,
therefore the triangles ABD, ADC are similar both to the
whole ABC and to one another.
[vi. 8]
And since the triangle ABC is similar to the triangle ABD,
therefore, as CB is to BA, so is BA to BD ;
[vi. 4]
therefore the rectangle CB, BD is equal to the square on AB.
[vi. 17]

For the same reason the rectangle BC, CD is also equal
to the square on AC.
And since, if in a right-angled triangle a perpendicular
be drawn from the right angle to the base, the perpendicular
so drawn is a mean proportional between the segments of the
base,
[vi. 8, Por.]
therefore, as BD is to DA, so is AD to DC;
therefore the rectangle BD, DC is equal to the square on AD.
[vi. 17]

I say that the rectangle BC, AD is also equal to the rect­
angle BA, AC.
For since, as we said, ABC is similar to ABD,
therefore, as BC is to CA, so is BA to AD.
[vi. 4]
Therefore the rectangle BC, AD is equal to the rectangle

BA, AC.

To find two straight lines incommensurable in square which
make the sum of the squares on them rational but the rectangle
contained by them medial.
Let there be set out two rational straight lines AB,
commensurable in square only
and such that the square on the
greater AB is greater than the
square on the less BC by the
square on a straight line in­
commensurable with AB,
