let BC be bisected at D,
let there be applied to AB a parallelogram equal to the square
on either of the straight lines BD, DC and deficient by a
square figure, and let it be the rectangle AE, EB;
[vi. 28]
let the semicircle AFB be described on AB,
let EE be. drawn at right angles to AB,
and let AE, EB be joined.
Then, since AB, BC are unequal straight lines,
and the square on AB is greater than the square on BC by
the square on a straight line incommensurable with AB,
while there has been applied to AB a parallelogram equal to
the fourth part of the square on BC, that is, to the square on
half of it, and deficient by a square figure, making the rect­
angle AE,
EB,
therefore AE is incommensurable with EB.
[x. 18]
And, as AE is to EB, so is the rectangle BA, AE to the
rectangle AB,
BE,
while the rectangle BA, AE is equal to the square on AE,
and the rectangle AB, BE to the square on BE;
therefore the square on AE is incommensurable with the
square on EB;
therefore AE, EB are incommensurable in square.
And, since AB is rational,
therefore the square on AB is also rational;
so that the sum of the squares on AE, EB is also rational.
[•• 47]

And since, again, the rectangle AE, EB is equal to the
square on EE,
and, by hypothesis, the rectangle AE, EB is also equal to the
square on BD,
therefore EE is equal to BD ;
therefore BC is double of EE,
so that the rectangle AB, BC is also commensurable with the
rectangle AB,
EE
But the rectangle AB, BC is medial;
[x. 21]
therefore the rectangle AB, EE is also medial.
