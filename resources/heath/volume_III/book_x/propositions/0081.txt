But the rectangle AB, EF
FB;
therefore the rectangle AF,

77

is equal to the rectangle AF,
[Lemma]

FB is also medial.

But it was also proved that the sum of the squares on these
straight lines is rational.
Therefore two straight lines AF, FB incommensurable
in square have been found which make the sum of the
squares on them rational, but the rectangle contained by them
medial.
Q. E. D.


Euclid takes* the straight lines found in x. 30, viz. p,

f>

Jl+A*'

He then solves geometrically the equations
x+y = p
.(1).

xyIf x, y are the values found, he takes u, v such that
K = px 1
v* =-py
py. )
and u, v are straight lines satisfying the conditions of the problem.
Solving algebraically, we get (if x>y)

whence

•(3)-

Euclid's proof that these straight lines fulfil the requirements is as follows.
(o) The constants in the equations (1) satisfy the conditions of x. 1 8 ;
therefore
x « y.
But
x :y = u : B*.
Therefore
u" ^ o ,
and u, v are thus incommensurable in square.
