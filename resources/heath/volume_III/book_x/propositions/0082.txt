PROPOSITION

34.

To find two straight lines incommensurable in square which
make the sum of the squares on them medial but the rectangle
contained by them rational.
Let there be set out two medial straight lines AB, BC,
commensurable in square only, such that the rectangle which
they contain is rational, and the square on AB is greater than
the square on BC by the square on a straight line incom­
mensurable with AB ;
fx. 31, ad fin.]

let the semicircle ADB be described on AB,
let BC be bisected at E,
let there be applied to AB a parallelogram equal to the square
on BE and deficient by a square figure, namely the rectangle
AF,

FB;

,

-

therefore AF is incommensurable in length with FB.
Let FD be drawn from F at right angles to AB,
and let AD, DB be joined.
