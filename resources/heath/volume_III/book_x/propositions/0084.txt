To find two straight lines incommensurable in square which
make the sum of the squares on them medial and the rectangle
contained by them medial and moreover incommensurable with
the sum of the squares on them.
Let there be set out two medial straight lines A B , B C
commensurable in square only, containing a medial rectangle,
and such that the square on A B is greater than the square on
B C by the square on a straight line incommensurable with
AB;
