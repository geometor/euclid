Therefore two straight lines AD, DB incommensurable
in square have been found which make the sum of the squares
on them medial and the rectangle contained by them medial
and moreover incommensurable with the sum of the squares
on them.
Q. E. D.


Take the medial straight lines found in x. 32 (2nd part), viz.
pA*,

pX*/^/7T^.

Solve the equations
x+y = p\i

and then put

)

u* = pA* . x |

v = p\i . y )
where x, y are the ascertained values of x, y.
Then u, v. are straight lines satisfying the given conditions.
Euclid proves this as follows,
(a) From (1) it follows [x. 18] that x ^ y.
Therefore
« ^ v,
and
u \s— v.
(B)
u* + 1? = p J\, which is a medial area
(y)
uv = p\t.Jxy
