According as p is of the form a or J A, we have a variety of forms for
u, v, arrived at by using the same transformations as in the notes on x. 30

If two rational straight lines commensurable in square
only be added together, the whole is irrational; and let it be
called binomial.
For let two rational straight lines AB, BC commen5 surable in square only be added
together;
I say that the whole AC is irrational.
For, since AB is incommensurable in length with BC—
10 for they are commensurable in square only—
and, as AB is to BC, so is the rectangle AB, BC to the
square on BC,
therefore the rectangle AB, BC is incommensurable with the
square on BC.

But twice the rectangle AB, BC is commensurable with
the rectangle AB, BC [x. 6], and the squares on AB, BC are
commensurable with the square on BC—for AB, BC are
rational straight lines commensurable in square only— [x. 15]
therefore twice the rectangle AB, BC is incommensurable
20 with the squares on AB, BC.
[x. 13]
And, componendo, twice the rectangle AB, BC together
with the squares on AB, BC, that is, the square on AC [11. 4],
is incommensurable with the sum of the squares on AB, BC.

But the sum of the squares on AB, BC is rational;

so that AC is also irrational.
