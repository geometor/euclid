Here begins the first hexad of propositions relating to compound irrational
straight lines. The six compound irrational straight lines are formed by
adding two parts, as the corresponding six in Props. 73—78 are formed by
subtraction. The relation between the six irrational straight lines in this and
the next five propositions with those described in Definitions II. and the
Props. 48—53 following thereon (the first, second, third, fourth, fifth and
sixth binomials) will be seen when we come to Props. 5 4 — 5 9 ; but it may be
stated here that the six compound irrationals in Props. 36—41 can be found
by means of the equivalent of extracting the square root of the compound
irrationals in x. 48—53 (the process being, strictly speaking, the finding of the
sides of the squares equal to the rectangles contained by the latter irrationals
respectively and a rational straight line as the other side), and it is therefore
the further removed compound irrational, so to speak, which is treated first.
In reproducing the proofs of the propositions, I shall for the sake of
simplicity call the two parts of the compound irrational straight line x, y,
explaining at the outset the forms which x, y really have in each case; x will
always be supposed to be the greater segment.
In this proposition x, y are of the form p, Ji . p, and (x +y) is proved to
be irrational thus.
x <^-y, so that x ^y.
Now
x : y = x* : xy,
so that
X* ^ xy.
But x* 1 (x? +_y ), and xy « 2xy;
therefore
(x +_Y ) V> 2xy,
and hence
(x* +y + 2xy) ^ (x* +y*).
But (x +y*) is rational;
therefore (x +yf, and therefore (x +y), is irrational.
This irrational straight line, p+ Jk.p, is called a binomial straight line.
This and the corresponding apotome (p— Jk.p) found in x. 73 are the
positive roots of the equation
x - 2 (1 +k)p . x + (1 -/*)V = o.

PROPOSITION 

37.

If two medial straight lines commensurable in square only
and containing a rational rectangle be added together, the
whole is irrational;

and let it be called a first bimedial

straight line.
For let two medial straight lines AB, BC commensurable
in square only and containing
a rational rectangle be added
g
together;
I say that the whole AC is irrational.
For, since AB is incommensurable in length with BC,
therefore the squares on AB, BC are also incommensurable
with twice the rectangle AB, BC;
