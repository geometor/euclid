and, componendo, the squares on AB, BC together with twice
the rectangle AB, BC, that is, the square on AC [11. 4], is
incommensurable with the rectangle AB, BC.
[x. 16]
But the rectangle AB, BC is rational, for, by hypothesis,
AB, BC are straight lines containing a rational rectangle ;
therefore the square on AC is irrational;
therefore AC is irrational.
[x. Def. 4]
And let it be called a first bimedial straight line.
Q. E. D.


Here x, y have the forms k^p, $p respectively, as found in x. 27.
Exactly as in the last case we prove that
x' +y' « 2xy,
whence
(x +yf w 2xy.
But xy is rational;
therefore (x +yY, and consequently (x +y), is irrational.
The irrational straight line k^p + $p is called a first bimedial straight line.
This and the corresponding first apotome of a medial (k^p - $p) found in
x. 74 are the positive roots of the equation

PROPOSITION 

38.

If two medial straight lines commensurable in square only
and containing a medial rectangle be added together, the whole
is irrational; and let it be called a second bimedial straight
line.

For let two medial straight lines AB, BC commensurable
in square only and containing
a medial rectangle be added
A
B
o
together;
I say that A C is irrational.

For let a rational straight
line DE be set out, and let the
parallelogram DE equal to the
square on A C be applied to DE,
producing DG as breadth.
[1. 44]

Then, since the square on AC is equal to the squares on
AB, BC and twice the rectangle AB, BC,
[11. 4]
let EH, equal to the squares on A B, BC, be applied to DE;
