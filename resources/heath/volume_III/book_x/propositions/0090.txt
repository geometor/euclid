therefore the remainder HF is equal to twice the rectangle

AB, BC.

And, since each of the straight lines AB, BC is medial,
therefore the squares on AB, BC are also medial.
But, by hypothesis, twice the rectangle AB, BC is also
medial.
And EH is equal to the squares on AB, BC,
25 while FH is equal to twice the rectangle AB, BC;
therefore each of the rectangles EH, HF is medial.
And they are applied to the rational straight line DE;
therefore each of the straight lines DH, HG is rational and
incommensurable in length with DE.

Since then AB is incommensurable in length with BC,
and, as AB is to BC, so is the square on AB to the rectangle

AB, BC,
therefore the square on AB is incommensurable with the rect­
angle AB, BC.
[x. 11]

But the sum of the squares on AB, BC is commensurable
with the square on AB,
[x. 15]
and twice the rectangle AB, BC is commensurable with the
rectangle AB, BC.
[x. 6]
Therefore the sum of the squares on AB, BC is incom40 mensurable with twice the rectangle AB, BC.
[x. 13]
But EH is equal to the squares on AB, BC,
and HF is equal to twice the rectangle AB, BC.
Therefore EH is incommensurable with HF,
so that DH is also incommensurable in length with HG.

Therefore DH, HG are rational straight lines commen­
surable in square only ;
so that DG is irrational.
[x. 36]
But DE is rational;
and the rectangle contained by an irrational and a rational
50 straight line is irrational;
[cf. x. 20]
therefore the area DF is irrational,
and the side of the square equal to it is irrational.
