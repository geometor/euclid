But AC is the side of the square equal to DF;
therefore A C is irrational.

And let it be called a second bimedial straight line.
Q. E. D.


After proving (1. s i ) that each of the squares on AB, BC is medial. Euclid
states (11. S4, 26) that EH, which is equal to the sum of the squares, is a
medial area, but does not explain why. It is because, by hypothesis, the
squares on AB, BC are commensurable, so that the sum of the squares is
commensurable with either [x. 15] and is therefore a medial area [x. 23, Por.].
In this case [x. 28, note] x, y are of the forms i^p, k^p/k^ respectively.
Apply each of the areas (x 4-y ) and 2xy to a rational straight line 0-, i.e.
suppose
x' +y = tru,
2xy = av.
Now it follows from the hypothesis, x. 15 and x. 23, Por. that (x'+y') is
a medial area; and so is 2xy, by hypothesis;
therefore tru, av are medial areas.
Therefore each of the straight lines u, v is rational and ^ a
(1).
Again
x « y;
therefore
x ^ xy.
But
x* « x* +y* and xy r> 2xy;
therefore
x +y ^ ixy,
or
tru W trv,
whence
u^ v
(s).
Therefore, by (1), (2), u, v are rational and
It follows, by x. 36, that (u + v) is irrational.
Therefore (u + v) cr is an irrational area [this can be deduced from x. so
by reductio ad absurdum],
whence (x +y) , and consequently (x +y), is irrational.

If two straight lines incommensurable in square wkich
make the sum of the squares on them rational, but the rectangle
contained by them medial, be added together, the whole straight
line is irrational: and let it be called major.
