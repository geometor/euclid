For let two straight lines AB, BC incommensurable in

I say that AC is irrational.
For, since the rectangle AB, BC is medial,
twice the rectangle AB, BC is also medial.
[x. 6 and 23, Por.]
But the sum of the squares on AB, BC is rational;
therefore twice the rectangle AB, BC is incommensurable
with the sum of the squares on AB, BC,
so that the squares on AB, BC together with twice the rect­
angle AB, BC, that is, the square on AC, is also incommen­
surable with the sum of the squares on AB, BC;
[x. 16]
therefore the square on A C is irrational,
so that AC is also irrational.
[x. Def. 4]
And let it be called major.

By hypothesis, the rectangle xy is medial;
therefore 2xy is medial.
Also (X? +y*) is a rational area.
Therefore
X* +y' ^ ixy,
whence
(x +yf ^ (x +y ),
so that (x +y) , and therefore (x +y), is irrational.

PROPOSITION 

40.

If two straight lines incommensurable in square which
make the sum of the squares on them medial, but the rectangle
contained by them rational, be added together, the whole straight
line is irrational; and let it be called the side of a rational
plus a medial area.
