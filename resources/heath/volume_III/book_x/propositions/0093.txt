For let two straight lines AB, BC incommensurable in
square, and fulfilling the given con­
ditions [x. 34], be added together;

I say that A C is irrational.
For, since the sum of the squares on AB, BC is medial,
while twice the rectangle AB, BC is rational,
therefore the sum of the squares on AB, BC is incommen­
surable with twice the rectangle AB, BC;
so that the square on A C is also incommensurable with twice
the rectangle AB, BC.
[x. 16]
But twice the rectangle AB, BC is rational;
therefore the square on A C is irrational.
Therefore A C is irrational.
[x. Def. 4]
And let it be called the side of a rational plus a
medial area.

In this case (x + y ) is a medial, and 2xy a rational, area; thus

+y w 2xy.
Therefore
(x +yf ^ 2xy,
whence, since 2xy is rational,
(x +yY, and consequently (x +y), is irrational.

If two straight lines incommensurable in square which
make the sum of the squares on them medial, and the rectangle
contained by them medial and also incommensurable with the
sum of the squares on them, be added together, the whole straight
line is irrational; and let it be called the side of the sum
of two medial areas.
