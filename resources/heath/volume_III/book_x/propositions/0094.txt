For let two straight lines AB, BC incommensurable in
square and satisfying the given conditions
[x. 35] be added together;
1 say that A C is irrational.
Let a rational straight line DE be set out,
and let there be applied to DE the rectangle
DE equal to the squares on AB, BC, and
the rectangle GH equal to twice the rectangle

AB, BC;
therefore the whole DH is equal to the square
on A C.
[n. 4]
Now, since the sum of the squares on
AB, BC is medial,
"
and is equal to DE,
therefore DE is also medial.
And it is applied to the rational straight line DE;
therefore DG is rational and incommensurable in length with
A

DE.

[x. 22]

For the same reason GK is also rational and incommen­
surable in length with GE, that is, DE.
And, since the squares on AB, BC are incommensurable
with twice the rectangle AB, BC,
DE is incommensurable with GH;
so that DG is also incommensurable with GK.
[vi. 1, x. 11]
And they are rational;
therefore DG, GK are rational straight lines commensurable
in square only;
therefore DK is irrational and what is called binomial, [x. 36]
But DE is rational;
therefore DH is irrational, and the side of the square which
is equal to it is irrational.
[x. Def. 4]
But AC is the side of the square equal to HD ;
therefore AC is irrational.
And let it be called the side of the sum of two medial
areas.
Q. E. D.


In this case x, y are of the form
