Since then au and av are both medial areas, u, v are rational and both
are wo(3).
Now, by ( 1 ) and (2),
au w av,
so that
u v.
By this and (3), u, v are rational and
Therefore [x. 36] (u + v) is irrational.
Hence a (u + v) is irrational [deduction from x. 20].
Thus (x +yf, and therefore (x +y), is irrational.

LEMMA.

And that the aforesaid irrational straight lines are divided
only in one way into the straight lines of which they are the
sum and which produce the types in question, we will now
prove after premising the following lemma.
Let the straight line AB be set out, let the whole be cut
into unequal parts at each of
the points C, D,
and let^Cbe supposed greater
D
E
C B
than DB;
I say that the squares on A C, CB are greater than the squares
on AD, DB.
For let AB be bisected at E.
Then, since AC is greater than DB,
let DC be subtracted from each ;
therefore the remainder AD is greater than the remainder CB.
But AE is equal to EB ;
therefore DE is less than EC;
