therefore the points C, D are not equidistant from the point
of bisection.
And, since the rectangle A C, CB together with the square
on EC is equal to the square on EB,
[11. 5]
and, further, the rectangle AD, DB together with the square
on DE is equal to the square on EB,
[id.]
therefore the rectangle AC, CB together with the square on
EC is equal to the rectangle AD, DB together with the
square on DE.
And of these the square on DE is less than the square
on EC;
therefore the remainder, the rectangle AC, CB, is also less
than the rectangle AD, DB,
so that twice the rectangle AC, CB is also less than twice
the rectangle AD, DB.
Therefore also the remainder, the sum of the squares on
A C, CB, is greater than the sum of the squares on AD, DB.

etSrj, and I have taken etdij to mean " types (of irrational straight lines)," though the expression
might perhaps mean " satisfying the conditions in question."

This proves that, if x +y = u + v, and if u, v are more nearly equal than
x, y (i.e. if the straight line is divided in the second case nearer to the point
of bisection), then

(x>+y )>(u*

It is first proved by means of u. 5 that

whence, since (x + y) = (u + vf, the required result follows.

A binomial straight line is divided into its terms at one
point only.
Let AB be a binomial straight line divided into its terms
at C;
therefore AC, CB are rational

straight lines commensurable in
square only.
[*• 36]
I say that AB is not divided at another point into two
rational straight lines commensurable in square only.
