For, if possible, let it be divided at D also, so that AD,
DB are also rational straight lines commensurable in square
only.
It is then manifest that AC is not the same with DB.
For, if possible, let it be so.
Then AD will also be the same as CB,
and, as A C is to CB, so will BD be to DA;
thus AB will be divided at D also in the same way as by the
division at C:
which is contrary to the hypothesis.
Therefore AC is not the same with DB.
For this reason also the points C, D are not equidistant
from the point of bisection.
Therefore that by which the squares on AC, CB differ
from the squares on AD, DB is also that by which twice
the rectangle AD, DB differs from twice the rectangle

AC, CB,
because both the squares on AC, CB together with twice the
rectangle AC, CB, and the squares on AD, DB together
with twice the rectangle AD, DB, are equal to the square
on AB.
[11. 4]
But the squares on AC, CB differ from the squares on
AD, DB by a rational area,
for both are rational;
therefore twice the rectangle AD, DB also differs from twice
the rectangle AC, CB by a rational area, though they are
medial [x. 2 1 ] :
which is absurd, for a medial area does not exceed a medial
by a rational area.
[x. 26]
Therefore a binomial straight line is not divided at different
points;
therefore it is divided at one point only.
Q. E. D.

This proposition proves the equivalent of the well-known theorem in
surds that,
if a + Jb = x + Jy,
a = x, b =y,
then
Ja + Jb = Jx + Jy,
and if
a = x, b=y (pra=y, fi = x).
then
