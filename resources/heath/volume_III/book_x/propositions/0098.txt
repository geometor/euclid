The proposition states that a binomial straight line cannot be split up into
terms (ovofMTa) in two ways. For, if possible, let
x +y = x' +y',
where x, y, and also x', y', are the terms of a binomial straight line, x, y
being different from x, y (or y, x).
One pair is necessarily more nearly equal than the other. Let x',y be
more nearly equal than x, y.
Then
(x +y ) - (x +y' ) = 2x'y' - 2xy.
Now by hypothesis (x +y ), (x' +y' ) are rational areas, being of the form
p + kp ;
but 2x'y', 2xy are medial areas, being of the form Jk. p ;
therefore the difference of two medial areas is rational:
which is impossible.
[x. 26]
Therefore x',y' cannot be different from x,y (pry, x).

PROPOSITION

43.

A first bimedial straight line is divided at one point only.
Let AB be a first bimedial straight line divided at C, so
that A C, CB are medial straight
lines commensurable in square
,—.
^
only and containing a rational
rectangle;
[x. 37]
I say that AB is not so divided at another point.
For, if possible, let it be divided at D also, so that AD,
DB are also medial straight lines commensurable in square
only and containing a rational rectangle.
Since, then, that by which twice the rectangle AD, DB
differs from twice the rectangle AC, CB is that by which the
squares on AC, CB differ from the squares on AD, DB,
while twice the rectangle AD, DB differs from twice the
rectangle AC, CB by a rational area—for both are rational—
therefore the squares on A C, CB also differ from the squares
on AD, DB by a rational area, though they are medial:
which is absurd.
[x. 26]
Therefore a first bimedial straight line is not divided into
its terms at different points;
therefore it is so divided at one point only.
