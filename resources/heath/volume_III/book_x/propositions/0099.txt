In this case, with the same hypothesis, viz. that
x+y

=

x'+y',

and x', y are more nearly equal than x, y ,
we have as before
(X*+y )-(x
+y' ) = zx'y — 2xy.
But, from the given properties of x, y , and x', y ' , it follows that 2xy, 2x'y

Therefore the difference between two medial areas is rational:
which is impossible.

A second bimedial straight line is divided at one point only.
Let AB be a second bimedial straight line divided at C,
so that AC, CB are medial straight lines commensurable in
square only and containing a medial rectangle ;
[x. 38]
it is then manifest that C is not at the point of bisection,
because the segments are not commensurable in length.
I say that AB is not so divided at another point.
C

—(—

For, if possible, let it be divided at D also, so that AC is
not the same with DB, but A C is supposed greater ;
it is then clear that the squares on AD, DB are also, as we
proved above [Lemma], less than the squares on A C, CB;
and suppose that AD, DB are medial straight lines commen­
surable in square only and containing a medial rectangle.
Now let a rational straight line EF be set out,
let there be applied to EF the rectangular parallelogram EK
equal to the square on AB,
and let EG equal to the squares on A C, CB be subtracted ;
therefore the remainder HK is equal to twice the rectangle

AC, CB.

Again, let there be subtracted EL, equal to the squares
on AD, DB, which were proved less than the squares on
AC, CB [Lemma] ;
