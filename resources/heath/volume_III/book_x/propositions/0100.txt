therefore the remainder MK is also equal to twice the rect­
angle AD, DB.
Now, since the squares on AC, CB are medial,
therefore EG is medial.
And it is applied to the rational straight line EE;
therefore EH is rational and incommensurable in length with

EE.

[x. 22]

For the same reason
HN is also rational and incommensurable in length with EE.
And, since AC, CB are medial straight lines commen­
surable in square only,
therefore AC is incommensurable in length with CB.
But, as AC is to CB, so is the square on AC to the rect­
angle
AC.CB;
therefore the square on A C is incommensurable with the rect­
angle AC, CB.
[in]
But the squares on AC, CB are commensurable with the
square on AC; for AC, CB are commensurable in square.
[*• «5]
And twice the rectangle AC, CB is commensurable with
the rectangle AC, CB.
[x. 6]
Therefore the squares on AC, CB are also incommen­
surable with twice the rectangle AC, CB.
[x. 13]
But EG is equal to the squares on A C, CB,
and HK is equal to twice the rectangle A C, CB;
therefore EG is incommensurable with HK,
so that EH is also incommensurable in length with HN.
[vi. I, x.

And they are rational;
therefore EH, HN are rational straight lines commensurable
in square only.
But, if two rational straight lines commensurable in square
only be added together, the whole is the irrational which is
called binomial.
[x. 36]
Therefore EN is a binomial straight line divided at H.
In the same way EM, MN will also be proved to be
rational straight lines commensurable in square only ;
and EN will be a binomial straight line divided at different
points, H and M.
