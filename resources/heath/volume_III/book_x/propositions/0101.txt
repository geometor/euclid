And EH is not the same with MN.
For the squares on AC, CB are greater than the squares
on AD, DB.
But the squares on AD, DB are greater than twice the
rectangle AD,
DB;
therefore also the squares on A C, CB, that is, EG, are much
greater than twice the rectangle AD, DB, that is, MK,
so that EH is also greater than MN.
Therefore EH is not the same with MN.
Q. E. D.


As the irrationality of the second bimedial straight line [x. 38] is proved by
means of the irrationality of the binomial straight line [x. 36], so the present
theorem is reduced to that of x. 42.
Suppose, if possible, that the second bimedial straight line can be divided
into its terms as such in two ways, i.e. that
x +y = x' +y,
where x, y are nearer equality than x, y.
Apply x' +y, 2xy to a rational straight line a, i.e. let
x' + y = au,
2xy = av.
Then, as in x. 38, the areas x^+y*, 2xy are medial, so that au, av are
medial;
therefore u, v are both rational and ^ a
(1).
Again, by hypothesis, x, y are medial straight lines commensurable in
square only;
therefore
x ^y.
Hence
x* ^ xy.
And x*~ (*» + f), while xy ~2xy;
therefore
(x* + y ) ~ 2xy,
or
au w av,
and hence
u^v
(2).
Therefore, by (1) and (2), u, v are rational straight lines commensurable
in square only;
therefore u + v is a binomial straight line.
Similarly, if x'' +y'' = au' and 2 * y = av',
u + v' will be proved to be a binomial straight line.
And, since (x +y)' = (x' +y'f, and therefore (» + ») = (»' + v'), it follows that
a binomial straight line is divided as such in two ways :
which is impossible.
[x. 42]
Therefore x +y, the given second bimedial straight line, can only be so
divided in one way.
In order to prove that u + v, u + v' represent a different division of the
same straight line, Euclid assumes that x + y > 2xy. This is of course an
easy inference from II. 7 ; but the assumption of it here renders it probable
that the Lemma after x. 59 is interpolated.
