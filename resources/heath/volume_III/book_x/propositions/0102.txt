A major straight line is divided at one and the same point
only.
Let AB be a major straight line divided at C, so that
AC, CB are incommensurable in
square and make the sum of the
^
1 1 g
squares on A C, CB rational, but the
rectangle A C, CB medial;
[x. 39]
I say that AB is not so divided at another point.
For, if possible, let it be divided at D also, so that AD,
DB are also incommensurable in square and make the sum
of the squares on AD, DB rational, but the rectangle con­
tained by them medial.
Then, since that by which the squares on A C, CB differ
from the squares on AD, DB is also that by which twice the
rectangle AD, DB differs from twice the rectangle AC, CB,
while the squares on AC, CB exceed the squares on AD,
DB by a rational area—for both are rational—
therefore twice the rectangle AD, DB also exceeds twice the
rectangle A C, CB by a rational area, though they are medial:
which is impossible.
[x. 26]
Therefore a major straight line is not divided at different
points ;
therefore it is only divided at one and the same point.

Q. E. D.


If possible, let the major irrational straight line be divided into terms in
two ways, viz. as (x +y) and (x' +/), where x', y' are supposed to be nearer
equality than x, y.
We have then, as in x. 42, 43,

-

(x +y) (x' +y' ) = 2x'y' - 2xy.
But, by hypothesis, (x +y ), (x' +/ ) are both rational, so that their
difference is rational.
Also, by hypothesis, 2x'y, 2xy are both medial areas;
therefore the difference of two medial areas is a rational area:
which is impossible.
[x. 26]
Therefore etc.
