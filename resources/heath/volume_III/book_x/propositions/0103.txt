The side of a rational plus a medial area is divided at one
point only.
Let AB be the side of a rational plus a medial area
divided at C, so that AC, CB are
incommensurable in square and make
A
d~o
B
the sum of the squares on AC, CB
medial, but twice the rectangle AC, CB rational;
[x. 40]
I say that AB is not so divided at another point.
For, if possible, let it be divided at D also, so that AD,
DB are also incommensurable in square and make the sum
of the squares on AD, DB medial, but twice the rectangle
AD, DB rational.
Since then that by which twice the rectangle AC, CB
differs from twice the rectangle AD, DB is also that by
which the squares on AD, DB differ from the squares on

AC, CB,
while twice the rectangle A C, CB exceeds twice the rectangle
AD, DB by a rational area,
therefore the squares on AD, DB also exceed the squares
on A C, CB by a rational area, though they are medial:
which is impossible.
[x. 26]
Therefore the side of a rational plus a medial area is not
divided at different points ;
therefore it is divided at one point only.
Q. E. D.


Here, as before, if we use the same notation,
(*"+/-)-

1

2

(x' + / )

= 2x'y' -

2xy,

and the areas on the left side are, by hypothesis, both medial, while the areas
on the right side are both rational.
Thus the result of x. 26 is contradicted, as before.
Therefore etc.
