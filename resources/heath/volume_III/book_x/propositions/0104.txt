CB medial, and the rectangle AC, CB medial and also in­
commensurable with the sum of the squares on them ;
I say that AB is not divided at another point so as to fulfil
the given conditions.

For, if possible, let it be divided at D, so that again AC
is of course not the same as BD, but AC is supposed greater;
let a rational straight line EF be set out,
and let there be applied to EF the rectangle EG equal to the
squares on AC, CB,
and the rectangle HK equal to twice the rectangle A C, CB;
therefore the whole EK is equal to the square on AB. [n. 4 ]
Again, let EL, equal to the squares on AD, DB, be applied
to EF;
therefore the remainder, twice the rectangle AD, DB, is equal
to the remainder MK.
And since, by hypothesis, the sum of the squares on AC,
CB is medial,
therefore EG is also medial.
And it is applied to the rational straight line EF;
therefore HE is rational and incommensurable in length with
EF.
[x. 22]
For the same reason
HN is also rational and incommensurable in length with EF.
And, since the sum of the squares on A C, CB is incom­
mensurable with twice the rectangle A C, CB,
therefore EG is also incommensurable with GN,
so that EH is also incommensurable with HN.
[vi. 1, x. n ]
And they are rational;
