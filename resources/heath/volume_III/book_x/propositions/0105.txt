therefore EH, HN are rational straight lines commensurable
in square only;
therefore EN is a binomial straight line divided at H. [x. 36]
Similarly we can prove that it is also divided at M.
And EH is not the same with MN;
therefore a binomial has been divided at different points :
which is absurd.
[x. 42]
Therefore a side of the sum of two medial areas is not
divided at different points;
therefore it is divided at one point only.
Using the same notation as in the note on x. 44, we suppose that, if
possible,
x +y = x + y ,
and we put
x* +y = cru\
^ x' + y = <ru'}

2x'y' = <rv' f '

2xy = <TV j

Then, since x* +_y , 2xy are medial areas, and a rational,
u, v are both rational and « a
Also, by hypothesis,
whence

o ixy,
u^v

(2).

Therefore, by ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , u, v are rational and
Hence u + v is a binomial straight line.
Similarly u + v' is a binomial straight line.
But
u + v = u' 4 v';
therefore a binomial straight line is divided into terms in two ways:
which is impossible.
Therefore etc.

DEFINITIONS II.

1. Given a rational straight line and a binomial, divided
into its terms, such that the square on the greater term is
greater than the square on the lesser by the square on a
straight line commensurable in length with the greater, then,
if the greater term be commensurable in length with the
rational straight line set out, let the whole be called a first
b i n o m i a l straight line;
2. but if the lesser term be commensurable in length
with the rational straight line set out, let the whole be called
a second binomial;
