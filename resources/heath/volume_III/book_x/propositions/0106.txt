than the square on the lesser by the square on a straight line
incommensurable in length with the greater, then, if the

PROPOSITION

48.

To find the first binomial straight line.
Let two numbers A C, CB be set out such that the sum
of them AB has to BC the ratio
which a square number has to a
square number, but has not to CA
+
the ratio which a square number
has to a square number;
A
c B
D

E

[Lemma 1 after x . 2 8 ]

let any rational straight line D be set out, and let EF be
commensurable in length with D.
Therefore EF is also rational.
Let it be contrived that,
as the number BA is to A C, so is the square on EF to the
square on FG.
fx. 6, Por.]
But AB has to AC the ratio which a number has to a
number;
therefore the square on EF also has to the square on FG
the ratio which a number has to a number,
so that the square on EF is commensurable with the square
on FG.
[x. 6]
And EF is rational;
therefore FG is also rational.
And, since BA has not to AC the ratio which a square
number has to a square number.
