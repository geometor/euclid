neither, therefore, has the square on EF to the square on FG
the ratio which a square number has to a square number ;
therefore EF is incommensurable in length with FG.
[x. 9 ]
Therefore EF, FG are rational straight lines commen­
surable in square only;
therefore EG is binomial
fx. 36]
I say that it is also a first binomial straight line.
For since, as the number BA is to AC, so is the square
on EF to the square on FG,
while BA is greater than AC,
therefore the square on EF is also greater than the square
on FG.
Let then the squares on FG, H be equal to the square on
EF.
Now since, as BA is to A C, so is the square on EF to the
square on FG,
therefore, convertendo,
as AB is to BC, so is the square on EF to the square on H.
[v. 19, Por.]

But AB has to BC the ratio which a square number has
to a square number ;
therefore the square on EF also has to the square on H the
ratio which a square number has to a square number.
Therefore EF is commensurable in length with H; [x. 9 ]
therefore the square on EF is greater than the square on FG
by the square on a straight line commensurable with EF.
And EF, FG are rational, and EF is commensurable in
length with D.
Therefore EF is a first binomial straight line.
Q. E. D.

Let kp be a straight line commensurable in length with p, a given rational
straight line.
The two numbers taken may be written p{nC- — n?),pri', where (nf-n?) is
not a square.
Take x such that
pm' :p(m'-ri ) = k pt. 4
