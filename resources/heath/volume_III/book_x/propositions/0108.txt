Also, k?p* being greater than x , suppose k'p' - x' =_y .
Then, from ( 1 ) ,
pm' : pn' = ky : f,
whence y is rational and * kp.
Therefore kp + x is a first binomial straight line [ x . Den". II. 1].
This binomial straight line may be written thus,

kp + kp J1 - K'.
When we come to x. 8 5 , we shall find that the corresponding straight line
with a negative sign is thefirstapotome,
kp- kp -J 1 - X .

Consider now the equation of which these two expressions are the roots.
T h e equation is
X - 2kp . X + A /6V = O.
In other words, the first binomial and the first apotome correspond to the
roots of the equation
a* — 2ax + X V = o,
where o = kp.

To find the second binomial straight line.
Let two numbers AC, CB be set out such that the sum
of them AB has to BC the ratio which
a square number has to a square number,
but has not to AC the ratio which a
square number has to a square number;
let a rational straight line D be set out,
and let EF be commensurable in length
with D;
therefore EF is rational.
Let it be contrived then that,
as the number CA is to AB, so also is the square on EF to
the square on FG;
[x. 6, Por.]
therefore the square on EF is commensurable with the square
on FG.
[x. 6 ]
Therefore FG is also rational.
Now, since the number CA has not to AB the ratio which
a square number has to a square number, neither has the
