square on EF to the square on FG the ratio which a square
number has to a square number.
Therefore EF is incommensurable in length with FG ;
Ex. 9]

therefore EF, FG are rational straight lines commensurable
in square only;
therefore EG is binomial.
[x. 3 6 ]
It is next to be proved that it is also a second binomial
straight line.
For since, inversely, as the number BA is to AC, so is
the square on GF to the square on FE,
while BA is greater than AC,
therefore the square on GF is greater than the square on FE.
Let the squares on EF, H be equal to the square on GF;
therefore, convertendo, as AB is to BC, so is the square on
FG to the square on H.
[v. 19, Por.]
But AB has to BC the ratio which a square number has
to a square number ;
therefore the square on FG also has to the square on H the
ratio which a square number has to a square number.
Therefore FG is commensurable in length with H; [x. 9 ]
so that the square on FG is greater than the square on FE
by the square on a straight line commensurable with FG.
And FG, FE are rational straight lines commensurable
in square only, and EF, the lesser term, is commensurable in
length with the rational straight line D set out.
Therefore EG is a second binomial straight line.
Q. E. D.

Taking a rational straight line kp commensurable in length with p, and
selecting numbers of the same form as before, viz. / (m — n ), pn , we put

Just as before, x is rational and «•*- kp,
whence kp + x is a binomial straight line.
