To find the third binomial straight line.
Let two numbers AC, CB be set out such that the sum
of them AB has to BC the ratio which a square number has
to a square number, but has not to AC the ratio which a square
number has to a square number.

EFLet any other number D, not square, be set out also, and
let it not have to either of the numbers BA. AC the ratio
which a square number has to a square number.
Let any rational straight line E be set out,
and let it be contrived that, as D is to AB, so is the square
on E to the square on FG ;
[x. 6, Por.]
therefore the square on E is commensurable with the square
on FG.
[x. 6]
And E is rational;
therefore FG is also rational.
