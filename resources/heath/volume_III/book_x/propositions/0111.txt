And, since D has not to AB the ratio which a square
number has to a square number,
neither has the square on E to the square on FG the ratio
which a square number has to a square number;
therefore E is incommensurable in length with FG.
[x. 9 ]
Next let it be contrived that, as the number BA is to AC,
so is the square on FG to the square on GH;
[x. 6, Por.]
therefore the square on FG is commensurable with the square
on GH.
[x. 6 ]
But FG is rational;
therefore GH is also rational.
And, since BA has not to AC the ratio which a square
number has to a square number,
neither has the square on FG to the square on HG the ratio
which a square number has to a square number;
therefore FG is incommensurable in length with GH.
[x. 9 ]
Therefore FG, GH are rational straight lines commen­
surable in square only;
therefore FH is binomial.
[x. 36]
I say next that it is also a third binomial straight line.
For since, as D is to AB, so is the square on E to the
square on FG,
and, as BA is to A C, so is the square on FG to the square
on GH,
therefore, ex aequali, as D is to A C, so is the square on E to
the square on GH
[V. 22]
But D has not to AC the ratio which a square number
has to a square number;
therefore neither has the square on E to the square on GH
the ratio which a square number has to a square number ;
therefore E is incommensurable in length with GH.
[x. 9 ]
And since, as BA is to AC, so is the square on FG to
the square on GH,
therefore the square on FG is greater than the square on GH.
Let then the squares on GH, K be equal to the square
on FG;
