therefore, convertendo, asAB is to BC, so is the square on FG
to the square on K.
[v. 19, Por.]
But AB has to BC the ratio which a square number has
to a square number ;
therefore the square on FG also has to the square on K the
ratio which a square number has to a square number;
therefore FG is commensurable in length with K.
[x. 9 ]
Therefore the square on FG is greater than the square on
GH by the square on a straight line commensurable with FG.
And FG, GH are rational straight lines commensurable
in square only, and neither of them is commensurable in length
with E.
Therefore FH is a third binomial straight line.
Q. E. D.

Let p be a rational straight line.
Take the numbers q (m — n ), qn ,
and let / be a third number which is not a square and which has not to qm
or q (m - n ) the ratio of square to square.
Take x such that
/ : qm = p : x
(1).
Thus
x is rational and « p
(2).
Next suppose that
qm : q (m - n ) = x -.y
(3).
It follows t h a t > is rational and « - x
(4).

Thus (x +_y) is a binomial straight line.
Again, from ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) , ex aequali,
p:q{m -n )
= p :y

Thus

and x, y are both « p;
