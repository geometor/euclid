m Jk. p — m J A.

p J1 - X*.
The two expressions are accordingly the roots of the equation
X* - 2m Jk . px + X.'m'kp* = o,
or
x* — 2ox + X V = o,
where
a = m Jk . p.

PROPOSITION 51.'

To find the fourth binomial straight line.
Let two numbers AC, CB be set out such that AB
neither has to BC, nor yet to AC, the ratio
which a square number has to a square number.
Let a rational straight line D be set out,
and let EF be commensurable in length with D;
therefore EF is also rational.
Let it be contrived that, as the number BA
is to A C, so is the square on EF to the square
on FG;
[ x . 6, Por.]
therefore the square on EF is commensurable
with the square on FG;
[x. 6 ]
therefore FG is also rational.
Now, since BA has not to AC the ratio which a square
number has to a square number,
neither has the square on EF to the square on FG the ratio
which a square number has to a square number;
therefore. EF is incommensurable in length with FG.
[x. 9 ]
Therefore EF, FG are rational straight lines commen­
surable in square only;
so that EG is binomial.

I say next that it is also a fourth binomial straight line.
For since, as BA is to A C, so is the square on EF to the
square on FG,
therefore the square on EF is greater than the square on FG.
Let then the squares on FG, H be equal to the square
on EF;
