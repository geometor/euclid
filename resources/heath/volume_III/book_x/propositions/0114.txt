therefore, convertendo, as the number AB is to BC, so is the
square on EF'to the square on H.
[v. 19, Por.]
But AB has not to BC the ratio which a square number
has to a square number;
therefore neither has the square on EF to the square on H
the ratio which a square number has to a square number.
Therefore EF is incommensurable in length with H; [x. 9]
therefore the square on EF is greater than the square on GF
by the square on a straight line incommensurable with EF.
And EF, FG are rational straight lines commensurable in
square only, and EF is commensurable in length with D.
Therefore EG is a fourth binomial straight line.
Q. E. D.

Take numbers m, n such that (m + n) has not to either m or n the ratio of
square to square.
Take x such that

To find the fifth binomial straight line.
Let two numbers AC, CB be set out such that AB has
not to either of them the ratio which a square number has
to a square number;
let any rational straight line D be set out,
