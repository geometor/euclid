and let EF be commensurable with D ;
therefore EF is rational.
Let it be contrived that, as CA is to AB,
square on EF to the square on FG.
[x. 6, Por.]
But CA has not to AB the ratio which a
square number has to a square number;
therefore neither has the square on EF to the
square on FG the ratio which a square number
has to a square number.
Therefore EF, FG are rational straight
lines commensurable in square only ;

therefore EG is binomial.

I say next that it is also a fifth binomial straight line.
For since, as CA is to AB, so is the square on EF tc
the square on FG,
inversely, as BA is to A C, so is the square on FG to the
square on FE;
therefore the square on GF is greater than the square on FE.
Let then the squares on EF, H be equal to the square
on GF;
therefore, convertendo, as the number AB is to BC, so is the
square on GF to the square on H.
[v. 19, Por.]
But AB has not to BC the ratio which a square number
has to a square number ;
therefore neither has the square on FG to the square on H
the ratio which a square number has to a square number.
Therefore FG is incommensurable in length with H; [x. 9]
so that the square on FG is greater than the square on FE
by the square on a straight line incommensurable with FG.
And GF, FE are rational straight lines commensurable
in square only, and the lesser term EF is commensurable in
length with the rational straight line D set out.
Therefore EG is a fifth binomial straight line.
Q. E. D.

If m, n be numbers of the kind taken in the last proposition, take x such
that
m : (m + n) = £ V : x*.
