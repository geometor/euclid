To find the sixth binomial straight line.
Let two numbers A C, CB be set out such that AB has
not to either of them the ratio which a
square number has to a square number ;
and let there also be another number D
which is not square and which has not to
either of the numbers BA, AC the ratio
which a square number has to a square
number.
Let any rational straight line E be set
out,
and let it be contrived that, as D is to AB,
so is the square on E to the square on FG;
[x. 6, Por.]
therefore the square on £ is commensurable with the square
on FG.
[x. 6 ]
And E is rational;
therefore FG is also rational.
Now, since D has not to AB the ratio which a square
number has to a square number,
