neither has the square on E to the square on FG the ratio
which a square number has to a square number ;
therefore E is incommensurable in length with FG.
[x. 9 ]
Again, let it be contrived that, as BA is to AC, so is the
square on FG to the square on GH.
[x. 6, Por.]
Therefore the square on FG is commensurable with the
square on HG.
[x. 6 ]
Therefore the square on HG is rational;
therefore HG is rational.
And, since BA has not to AC the ratio which a square
number has to a square number,
neither has the square on FG to the square on GH the ratio
which a square number has to a square number;
therefore FG is incommensurable in length with GH.
[x. 9 ]
Therefore FG, GH are rational straight lines commen­
surable in square only;
therefore FH is binomial.
[x. 36]
It is next to be proved that it is also a sixth binomial
straight line.
F o r since, as D is to AB, so is the square on E to the
square on FG,
and also, as 3A is to AC, so is the square on FG to the
square on GH,
therefore, ex aequali, as D is to AC, so is the square on E
to the square on GH.
[v. 22]
But D has not to AC the ratio which a square number
has to a square number ;
therefore neither has the square on E to the square on GH
the ratio which a square number has to a square number;
therefore £ is incommensurable in length with GH.
[x. 9 ]
But it was also proved incommensurable with FG;
therefore each of the straight lines FG, GH is incommen­
surable in length with E.
And, since, as BA is to AC, so is the square on FG to
the square on GH,
therefore the square on FG is greater than the square on GH.
Let then the squares on GH, K be equal to the square
on FG;
