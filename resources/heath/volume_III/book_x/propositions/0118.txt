therefore, convertendo, as AB is to BC, so is the square on FG
to the square on K.
[v. 19, Por.]
But AB has not to BC the ratio which a square number
has to a square number ;
so that neither has the square on FG to the square on K the
ratio which a square number has to a square number.
Therefore FG is incommensurable in length with K; [x. 9 ]
therefore the square on FG is greater than the square on GH
by the square on a straight line incommensurable with FG.
ka&FG, GHare rational straight lines commensurable in
square only, and neither of them is commensurable in length
with the rational straight line E set out.
Therefore FH is a sixth binomial straight line.
Q. E. D.

Take numbers m, n such that (m + « ) has not to either of the numbers
m, n the ratio of square to square; take also a third number p, which is not
square, and which has not to either of the numbers (m + n), m the ratio of
square to square.

Let

p:(m + n) = p : x

(1)

and

(m + n):m = x* : j*
(2).
Then shall (x + y) be a sixth binomial straight line.
For, by ( 1 ) , x is rational and ^ p.
By ( 2 ) , since x is rational,
y is rational and ^ x.
Hence x, y are rational and commensurable in square only, so that (x +y)
is a binomial straight line.
Again, ex aequali, from ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) ,
p:m = p':f
whence y « p.
Thus x, y are both incommensurable in length with p.
Lastly, from ( 2 ) , convertendo,
(m + n) :n = x*:

(x'-f),

so that -Jx
—fs,x.
Therefore (x + y) is a sixth binomial straight line.
Now, from ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) ,
