Tannery remarks ("I)e la solution gdometrique des problemes du second
degrd avant Euclide" in Af/moires de Id Sociitides sciences physiques et naturelles
de Bordeaux, 2 Sene, T. iv.) that Euclid admits as binomials and apotomes
the third and sixth binomials and apotomes which are the square roots of first
binomials and apotomes respectively. Hence the third and sixth binomials
and apotomes are the positive roots of biquadratic equations of the same form
as the quadratics which give as roots the first and fourth binomials and
apotomes. But this remark seems to be of no value because (as was pointed
out a hundred years ago by Cossali, IT. p. 2 6 0 ) the squares of all the six
binomials and apotomes (including the first and fourth) give first binomials
and apotomes respectively. Hence we may equally well regard them all as
roots of biquadratics reducible to quadratics, or generally as roots of equations
of the form
e

#** + 2a .
±q = o;
and nothing is gained by raising the degree of the equations in this way.
It is, of course, easy to see that the most general form of binomial and
apotome, viz.
p • -Jh ± p . JX,
give first binomials and apotomes when squared.
For the square is p {(h + X ) p ± 2 JhX. p}; and the expression within the
bracket is a first binomial or apotome, because

*/(h + X)* - 4AX = h-X, which is « (h + X),

LEMMA.
Let there be two squares AB, BC, and let them be placed
so that DB is in a straight line with BE;
therefore FB is also in a straight line with
BG.
B
Let the parallelogram AC be completed;
I say that AC is a square, that DG is a
mean proportional between AB, BC, and
further that DC is a mean proportional
between AC, CB.
For, since DB is equal to BF, and BE to BG,
therefore the whole DE is equal to the whole FG.
But DE is equal to each of the straight lines AH, KC,
and FG is equal to each of the straight lines AK, HC; [1. 3 4 ]
