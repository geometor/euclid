therefore each of the straight lines AH, KC is also equal to
each of the straight lines AK, HC.
Therefore the parallelogram A C is equilateral.
And it is also rectangular ;
therefore A C is a square.
And since, as FB is to BG, so is DB to BE,
while, as FB is to BG, so is AB to DG,
and, as DB is to BE, so is DG to BC,
[vi. i]
therefore also, as AB is to DG, so is DG to BC.
[v. n ]
Therefore Z><9 is a mean proportional between AB, BC.
I say next that DC is also a mean proportional between
CB.
F o r since, as AD is to DK, so is AT? to GC—
for they are equal respectively—
and, componendo, as AK is to KD, so is KC to CG,
[v. 18]
while, as AK is to A T A so is A C to CZ?,
and, as KC is to CG, so is Z?C to CZ?,
[vi. i]
therefore also, as A C is to DC, so is DC to Z?C.
[v. n ]
Therefore DC is a mean proportional between A C, CB.

T h e first of the two results is proved in the course of x. 25 (lines 6 — 8 on

of this Lemma.
PROPOSITION

54.

If an area be contained by a rational straight line and the
first binomial, the "side" of the area is the irrational straight
line which is called binomial.
F o r let the area AC he contained by the rational straight
line AB and the first binomial AD ;
I say that the "side" of the area AC is the irrational straight
line which is called binomial.
For, since AD is a first binomial straight line, let it be
divided into its terms at E,
and let AE be the greater term.
