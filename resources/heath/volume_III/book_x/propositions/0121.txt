It is then manifest that AE, ED are rational straight lines
commensurable in square only,
the square on AE is greater than the square on ED by the
square on a straight line commensurable with AE,
and AE is commensurable in length with the rational straight
line A B set out.

Then, since the square on AE is greater than the square
on ED by the square on a straight line commensurable with
AE,
therefore, if there be applied to the greater AE a parallelogram
equal to the fourth part of the square on the less, that is, to
the square on EF, and deficient by a square figure, it divides
it into commensurable parts.
[x. 17]
Let then the rectangle AG, GE equal to the square on
EF be applied to AE;
therefore AG is commensurable in length with EG.
Let GH, EK, FL be drawn from G, E, F parallel to
either of the straight lines AB, CD;
let the square SN be constructed equal to the parallelogram
AH, and the square NQ equal to GK,
[11. 14]
and let them be placed so that MN is in a straight line with
NO ;
therefore RN is also in a straight line with NP.
A n d let the parallelogram SQ be completed ;
therefore SQ is a square.
[Lemma]
Now, since the rectangle AG, GE is equal to the square
on EF,
therefore, as AG is to EF, so is FE to EG;
[vi. 17]
therefore also, as AH is to EL, so is EL to KG;
[vi. 1]
therefore EL is a mean proportional between A H, GK.
But A His equal to SN, and GK to NQ ;
therefore EL is a mean proportional between SN, NQ.
