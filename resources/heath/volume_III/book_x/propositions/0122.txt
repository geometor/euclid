But MR is also a mean proportional between the same
SN,

NQ;

[Lemma]

therefore EL is equal to MR,
so that it is also equal to PO.
But AH, GK are also equal to SN,
NQ;
therefore the whole AC is equal to the whole SQ, that is, to
the square on MO;
therefore MO is the "side" of AC.
I say next that MO is binomial.
For, since AG is commensurable with GE,
therefore AE is also commensurable with each of the straight
lines AG, GE.
[x. 15]
But AE is also, by hypothesis, commensurable with AB ;
therefore AG, GE are also commensurable with AB.
[x. 12]
And AB is rational;
therefore each of the straight lines A G, GE is also rational;
therefore each of the rectangles AH, GK is rational,
[x. 19]
and AH is commensurable with GK.
But AH is equal to SN, and GK to NQ ;
therefore SN, NQ, that is, the squares on MN, NO, are
rational and commensurable.
And, since AE is incommensurable in length with ED,
while AE is commensurable with AG, and DE is commen­
surable with EF,
therefore AG is also incommensurable with EF,
[x. 13]
so that AH is also incommensurable with EL.
[vi. 1, x. 11]
But AH is equal to SN, and EL to MR;
therefore SN is also incommensurable with MR.
But, as SN is to MR, so is PN to NR;
[vi. 1]
therefore PN is incommensurable with -A/A.
[x. u ]
But PN is equal to MN, and JSfiff to NO ;
therefore MN is incommensurable with NO.
And the square on MN is commensurable with the square
on NO,
and each is rational;
therefore MN, NO are rational straight lines commensurable
in square only.
