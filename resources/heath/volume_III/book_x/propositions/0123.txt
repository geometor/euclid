A first binomial

straight line being, as we have seen in x . 48, of the form

kp + kpji -A",
the problem solved in this proposition is the equivalent of finding the square
root of this expression

multiplied

by p, or of
a

p(kp + kpji

-A ),

and of proving that the said square root represents a binomial
as defined in x . 36.

straight line

The geometrical method corresponds sufficiently closely to the algebraical
one which we should use.
First solve the equations

Then, if u, v represent the straight lines so found, put
x = pu
1

y

and the straight line (x +y) is the square root required.
The actual algebraical solution of (1) gives
u - v = kp. A,
so that
u = \kp(i + A),
v =
l*p(i-\),
and therefore

x =p

(1 + A),

and
This is clearly a binomial straight line as defined in x . 36.
Since Euclid has to express his results by straight lines in his figure, and
has no symbols to make the result obvious by inspection, he is obliged to
prove (1) that (x + y) is the square root of p(ip + kp J1 - A*), and ( 2 ) that
(* + y) is a binomial straight line, in the following manner.
First, he proves, by means of the preceding Lemma, that
g r - i / J t T ?

by (1) and (3),

x + y = Jp(kp + kp\fi - A*).
