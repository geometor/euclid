thus u, v are rational,

Since the first binomial straight line and the first apotome are the roots of

PROPOSITION

55.

If an area be contained by a rational straight line and the
second binomial, the "side" of the area is the irrational straight
line r.'hich is called a first bimedial.
F o r let the area A BCD be contained by the rational
5 straight line AB and the second binomial AD ;
I say that the "side" of the area AC is a first bimedial straight
line.
For, since AD is a second binomial straight line, let it be
divided into its terms at E, so that AE is the greater term ;
10 therefore AE, ED are rational straight lines commensurable
in square only,
the square on AE is greater than the square on ED by the
square on a straight line commensurable with AE,
and the lesser term ED is commensurable in length with AB.
