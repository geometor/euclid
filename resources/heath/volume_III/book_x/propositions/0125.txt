and let there be applied to AE the rectangle AG, GE equal
to the square on EF and deficient by a square figure ;
therefore AG is commensurable in length with GE.
[x. 17]
Through G, E, F let GH, EK, FL be drawn parallel to
*> AB, CD,
let the square SN be constructed equal to the parallelogram
AH, and the square NQ equal to GK,
and let them be placed so that MN is in a straight line with
NO;
25 therefore RN is also in a straight line with NP.

Let the square SQ be completed.
It is then manifest from what was proved before that MR
is a mean proportional between SN, NQ and is equal to EL,
and that MO is the "side" of the area AC.
It is now to be proved that MO is a first bimedial straight line.

Since AE is incommensurable in length with ED,
while ED is commensurable with AB,
therefore AE is incommensurable with AB.
[x. 13]
And, since AG is commensurable with EG,
35 AE is also commensurable with each of the straight lines
AG, GE.
[x. 15]
But AE is incommensurable in length with AB;
therefore AG, GE are also incommensurable with AB. [x. 13]
Therefore BA, AG and BA, GE are pairs of rational
40 straight lines commensurable in square only ;
so that each of the rectangles AH, GK is medial.
[x. 21]
Hence each of the squares SN, NQ is medial.
Therefore MN, NO are also medial.
And, since A G is commensurable in length with GE,
45 AH is also commensurable with GK,
[vi. 1, x. n ]
that is, SN is commensurable with NQ,
that is, the square on MN with the square on NO.
