As in the last proposition, Euclid finds u, v from the equations

uv = J / J V
then finds x, y from the equations
x* = pu
f=pv
and then proves (a) that

and (/?) that (x +y) is a first bimedial straight line [ x . 3 7 ] .
The steps in the proof are as follows.
For (a) reference to the corresponding part of the previous proposition
suffices.
(0) B y ( i ) a n d x . 17,

therefore u, v are both rational and « (u+v), and therefore v p [by ( i ) ] . . . ( 3 ) .

Hence pu, pv, or x , y , are medial areas,
so that x, y are also medial

But, since u « p,

Thus [(4), (5), (6)] x, y are medial and
Lastly, xy = \kp\ which is rational.
Therefore (x+y) is a first bimedial straight line.
The actual straight lines obtained from ( 1 ) are
