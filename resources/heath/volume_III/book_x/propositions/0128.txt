If an area be contained by a rational straight line and the
third binomial, the "side" of the area is the irrational straight
line called a second bimedial.
F o r let the area A BCD be contained by the rational
straight line AB and the third binomial AD divided into its
terms at E, of which terms AE is the greater ;
I say that the "side" of the area AC is the irrational straight
line called a second bimedial.
F o r let the same construction be made as before

Now, since AD is a third binomial straight line,
therefore AE, ED are rational straight lines commensurable
in square only,
the square on AE is greater than the square on ED by the
square on a straight line commensurable with AE,
and neither of the terms AE, ED is commensurable in length
with AB.
[x. Deff. 11. 3]
Then, in manner similar to the foregoing, we shall prove
that MO is the "side" of the area AC,
and MN, NO are medial straight lines commensurable in
square only;
so that MO is bimedial.
It is next to be proved that it is also a second bimedial
straight line.
Since DE is incommensurable in length with AB, that is,
with EK,
and DE is commensurable with EF,
therefore EF is incommensurable in length with EK.

And they are rational;
