therefore FE, EK are rational straight lines commensurable
in square only.
Therefore EL, that is, MR, is medial.
[x. 21]
And it is contained by MN, NO ;
therefore the rectangle MN, NO is medial.
Therefore MO is a second bimedial straight line.

Q. E. D.

This proposition in like manner is the equivalent of finding the square

loot of the product of 0 and the third binomial [x. 50], i.e. of the expression
As before, put

u + v=Jk.p
1
uv = ±hp*(i-\*) J

w

Next, u, v being found, let

x* = pu,
then (x +y) is the square root required and is a second bimedial straight line.
x

[ -38]
For, as in the last proposition, it is proved that (x +y) is the square root,
and x, y are medial and
%

s

Again, xy = \Jk.p
Ji - X , which is medial.
Hence (x + v) is a second bimedial straight line.
By solving equations (i), we find

« = \(Jk.p +
v = iUh.p-\Jh. ),

\Jk.p),

P

and

x+y = p ^ / ^ (1 + X) + P ^ / ^ (1 - A).
The corresponding second apotome of a medial found in x. 93 is the same

thing with a minus sign between the terms, and the two are the roots (cf. note
on x. 5 0 ) of the biquadratic equation

pV + k'hp* = o.

PROPOSITION

57.

If an area be contained by a rational straight line and the
fourth binomial, the "side" of the area is the irrational straight
line called major.
For let the area AC be contained by the rational straight
line AB and the fourth binomial AD divided into its terms
at E, of which terms let AE be the greater ;
I say that the "side" of the area AC is the irrational straight
line called major.
