And the [sum] of the squares on MN, NO is rational,
and MN, NO are incommensurable in square.
But, if two straight lines incommensurable in square and
making the sum of the squares on them rational, but the
rectangle contained by them medial, be added together, the
whole is irrational and is called major.
[x. 39]
Therefore MO is the irrational straight line called major
and is the "side" of the area AC.
Q. E. D.

The problem here is to find the square root of the expression [cf. x . 5 1 ]

(x +y) is the required square root.
T o prove that (x +y) is the major irrational straight line Euclid argues
thus.
By x. 18,

Lastly, xy = I —~-—, which is a medial area

Thus [(3), ( 4 ) , (5)] (x+y) is a major irrational straight line.
Actual solution gives

The corresponding square root found in x. 9 4 is the minor irrational
straight line, the terms being separated by a minus sign, and the two straight
lines are the roots (cf. note on x . 5 1 ) of the biquadratic equation
