And EK is rational;
therefore EL, that is, MR, that is, the rectangle MN, NO, is
also rational.
[x. 19]
Therefore MN, NO are straight lines incommensurable
in square which make the sum of the squares on them medial,
but the rectangle contained by them rational.
Therefore MO is the side o f a rational plus a medial area
[x. 40] and is the "side" of the area AC.

We have here to find the square root of the expression [cf. x. 5 2 ]

As usual, we put

Then, u, v being found, we take

and (x +y), so founu, is our required square root.
Euclid's proof of the class of (x + y) is as follows:
By x. 18,
u ^> v;
therefore
pu ^ pv,
so that
x ^/,

x^-y
Next

whence
p (u + v), or (x -t-y ), is a medial area

Lastly,
xy - \kp , which is a rational area

Hence [(3), (4), (5)] (x+y) is the side of a rational plus a medial area.

The corresponding "side" found in x. 95 is a straight line which produces
with a rational area a medial whole, being of the form (x -y), where x, y
have the same values as above.
The two square roots are (cf. note on x . 52) the roots of the biquadratic
