Proposition

59.

If an area be contained by a rational straight line and the
sixth binomial, the "side" of the area is the irrational straight
line called the side of the sum of two medial areas.
F o r let the area ABCD
be contained by the rational
straight line AB and the sixth binomial AD, divided into its
terms at E, so that AE is the greater term ;
I say that the "side" of AC is the side of the sum of two
medial areas.
Let the same construction be made as before shown.

It is then manifest that MO is the "side" of AC, and
that MN is incommensurable in square with NO.
Now, since EA is incommensurable in length with AB,
therefore EA, AB are rational straight lines commensurable
in square only;
therefore AK, that is, the sum of the squares on MN, NO,
is medial.
[x. 21]
Again, since ED is incommensurable in length with AB,
therefore FE is also incommensurable with EK;
[x. 13]
therefore FE, EK are rational straight lines commensurable
in square only ;
therefore EL, that is, MR, that is, the rectangle MN, NO, is
medial.
[x. 21]
And, since AE is incommensurable with EF,
AK is also incommensurable with EL.
[vi. 1, x. n ]
But AK is the sum of the squares on MN, NO,
and EL is the rectangle MN, NO;
therefore the sum of the squares on MN, NO is incommen­
surable with the rectangle MN, NO..
And each of them is medial, and MN, NO are incom­
mensurable in square.
