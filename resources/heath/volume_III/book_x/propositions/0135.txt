Therefore MO is the side of the sum of two medial areas
[x. 41], and is the " s i d e " of AC.
Q. E. D.

Euclid here finds the square root of the expression [cf. x . 5 3 ]
k

As usual, we solve the equations
«
V=Jh.p\
UV = \ P
\p J
then, u, * being found, we put

and (x + y) is the square root required.
Euclid proves that (x +y) is the side of (the sum of) two medial areas, as
follows.
As in the last two propositions, x, y are proved to be incommensurable
in square.
Now Jk. p, p are.commensurable in square only;
therefore
p (u + v), or (x +y ), is a medial area
(3).
Next,
xy = J JX \ p\ which is again a medial area
(4).
Lastly,
Jk.p^\J\.j>,
so that
Jk.p*

that is,
(x' +_y ) « xy
(5).
Hence [(3), (4), (5)] (x +y) is the side of the sum of two medial areas.
Solving the equations algebraically, we have

The corresponding square root found in x . 96 is x-y,
