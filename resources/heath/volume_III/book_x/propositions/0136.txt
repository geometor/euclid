[Lemma, x. 6 0

F o r let AB be bisected at D.
Since then a straight line has been cut into equal parts
at D, and into unequal parts at C,
therefore the rectangle AC, CB together with the square on
CD is equal to the square on AD,
[11. 5]
so that the rectangle AC, CB is less than the square on AD;
therefore twice the rectangle AC, CB is less than double of
the square on AD.
But the squares on AC, CB are double of the squares on
AD, DC;
[11. ]
therefore the squares on A C, CB are greater than twice the
rectangle A C, CB.

We have already remarked (note on x. 4 4 ) that the Lemma here proving
that
can hardly be genuine, since the result is used in x. 44.

PROPOSITION

60.

The square on the binomial straight line applied to a
rational straight line produces as breadth the first binomial.
Let AB be a binomial straight line divided into its terms
at C, so that A C is the greater term;
let a rational straight line DE be
*
set out,
and let DEFG
equal to the square
on AB be applied to DE producing
DG as' its breadth ;
I say that DG is a first binomial
straight line.
F o r let there be applied to DE the rectangle DH equal
to the square on AC, and KL equal to the square on BC;
therefore the remainder, twice the rectangle AC, CB, is equal
to MF.
Let MG be bisected at N, and let NO be drawn parallel
[to ML or GF].
Therefore each of the rectangles MO, NF is equal to
once the rectangle AC, CB.
Now, since AB is a binomial divided into its terms at C,
