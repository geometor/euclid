therefore AC, CB are rational straight lines commensurable
in square only ;
[x. 36]
therefore the squares on AC, CB are rational and commen­
surable with one another,
so that the sum of the squares or AC, CB is also rational.
[x. 15]

And it is equal to DL ;
therefore DL is rational.
And it is applied to the rational straight line DE;
therefore DM is rational and commensurable in length with
DE.
[x. 20]
Again, since A C, CB are rational straight lines commen­
surable in square only,
therefore twice the rectangle A C, CB, that is ME, is medial.
[x. 21]
And it is applied to the rational straight line ML \
therefore MG is also rational and incommensurable in length
with ML, that is, DE.
[x. 22]
But MD is also rational and is commensurable in length
with DE;
therefore DM is incommensurable in length with MG. [x. 13]
And they are rational;
therefore DM, MG are rational straight lines commensurable
in square only;
therefore DG is binomial.
fx. 36]
It is next to be proved that it is also a first binomial
straight line.
Since the rectangle AC, CB is a mean proportional between
the squares on AC, CB,
[cf. L e m m a after x. 53]
therefore MO is also a mean proportional between DH, KL.
Therefore, as DH is to MO, so is MO to KL,
that is, as DK is to MN, so is MN to MK;
[vi. 1]
therefore the rectangle DK, KM is equal to the square
on MN.
[vi. 17]
And, since the square on AC is commensurable with the
square on CB,
DH is also commensurable with KL,
so that DK is also commensurable with KM.
