And, since the squares on A C, CB are greater than twice
the rectangle AC, CB,
[Lemma]
therefore DL is also greater than MF,
so that DM is also greater than MG.
[vi. 1]
And the rectangle DK, KM is equal to the square on
MN, that is, to the fourth part of the square on MG,
and DK is commensurable with KM.
But, if there be two unequal straight lines, and to the greater
there be applied a parallelogram equal to the fourth part of
the square on the less and deficient by a square figure, and
if it divide it into commensurable parts, the square on the
greater is greater than the square on the less by the square
on a straight line commensurable with the greater;
[x. 17]
therefore the square on DM is greater than the square on
MG by the square on a straight line commensurable with DM.
And DM, MG are rational,
and DM, which is the greater term, is commensurable in length
with the rational straight line DE set out.
Therefore DG is a first binomial straight line. [x. Deff. n. 1]
Q. E. D.

In the hexad of propositions beginning with this we have the solution of
the converse problem to that of x . 5 4 — 5 9 . W e find the squares of the
irrational straight lines of x . 3 6 — 4 1 and prove that they are respectively equal
to the rectangles contained by a rational straight line and thefirst,second,
third, fourth, fifth and sixth binomials.
In x . 6 0 we prove that, p + Jk. p being a binomial straight line [ x . 3 6 ] ,
<T

is a first binomial straight line, and we find it geometrically.
T h e procedure may be represented thus.
Take x,y, 2 such that
ax = p ,

<r . 22 = 2 Jk . p*,
p', kp' being of course the squares on the terms of the original binomial,
and 2 Jk. p' twice the rectangle contained by them.
Then

fr*j)+«r

and we have to prove that (x + y) + 20 is a first binomial straight line of which
(x+y), 22 are the terms and (x+y) the greater.
Euclid divides the proof into two parts, showing first that (x + y) + 22 is
some binomial, and secondly that it is the first binomial.
