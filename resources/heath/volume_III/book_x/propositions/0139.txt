PROPOSITION

61.

The square on the first bimedial straight line applied to a
rational straight line produces as breadth the second binomial.
Let AB be a first bimedial straight line divided into its
medials at C, of which medials AC
is the greater ;
„ „ „ „ . . . „
&
T

let a rational straight line DE be set
out,
and let there be applied to DE the
parallelogram

AB, producing
DG astoitsthe
