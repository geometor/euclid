Then, since AB is a first bimedial divided at C,
therefore AC, CB are medial straight lines commensurable in
square only, and containing a rational rectangle,
[x. 37]
so that the squares on AC, CB are also medial.
[x. 21]
Therefore DL is medial.
[x. 15 and 23, Por.]
And it has been applied to the rational straight line DE;
therefore MD is rational and incommensurable in length
with DE.
[x. 22]
Again, since twice the rectangle AC, CB is rational, ME is
also rational.
And it is applied to the rational straight line ML ;
therefore MG is also rational and commensurable in length
with ML, that is, DE;
[x. 20]
therefore DM is incommensurable in length with MG. [x. 13]
And they are rational;
therefore DM, MG are rational straight lines commensurable
in square only ;
therefore DG is binomial.
[x. 36]
It is next to be proved that it is also a second binomial
straight line.
For, since the squares on AC, CB are greater than twice
the rectangle AC, CB,
therefore DL is also greater than MF,
so that DM is also greater than MG.
[vi. 1]
And, since the square on A C is commensurable with the
square on CB,
DH is also commensurable with KL,
so that DK is also commensurable with KM.
[vi, 1, x. 11]
And the rectangle DK, KM is equal to the square on MN;
therefore the square on DM is greater than the square on
MG by the square on a straight line commensurable with DM.

And MG is commensurable in length with DE.
Therefore DG is a second binomial straight line. [x. Deff. n. 2J
In this case we have to prove that, ($p + $p)
straight line, as found in x. 37,
a
is a second binomial straight line.
