The form of the proposition and the figure being similar to those of x . 60,
I can somewhat abbreviate the reproduction of the proof.
Take x, y, z such that

<rx = AY,
*y = AY,
O-. 2Z = Ap .

Then shall (x +y) + 2z be a second binomial.
(o) A^p, ^ o . a r e medial straight lines commensurable in square only and
containing a rational rectangle.
[x. 3 7 ]
The squares AY, *Y are medial;
thus the sum, or <r(x+y), is medial.
Therefore (x +y) is rational and cr.
And c r . 22 is rational;
therefore
22 is rational and « cr
Therefore (x +y), 22 are rational and •—

so that
(/?)

(x +y) > 22.

&Y being commensurable,

x « y.
xy = z ,

And

while x+y=

(1).
(2),

(x+y) + 22 is a binomial.

As before,
Now, AY,

[ x . 23, Por.]

AY

Hence [x. 17]
But 22 " <r, by ( 1 ) .

J(x + y) - (2Z) «(x

...(3).

Therefore [(1), (2), ( 3 ) ] (x +y) + 22 is a second binomial straight line.
Of course (x +y) + 22 = % {JA (1 + k) + 2A}.
PROPOSITION

62.

Tfo square on the second bimedial straight line applied to
a rational straight line produces as breadth the third binomial.
Let AB be a. second bimedial straight line divided into
its medials at C, so that AC is the
K M
greater segment;
let DE be any rational straight line,
and to DE let there be applied the
parallelogram DE equal to the square
on AB and producing DG as its
H L
breadth ;
^
g—
I say that DG is a third binomial
straight line.
Let the same construction be made as before shown.
