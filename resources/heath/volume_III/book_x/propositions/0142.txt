Then, since AB is a second bimedial divided at C,
therefore AC, CB are medial straight lines commensurable in
square only and containing a medial rectangle,
[x. 38]
so that the sum of the squax'es on AC, CB is also medial.
[x. 15 and 23 Por.]
And it is equal to DL ;
therefore DL is also medial.
And it is applied to the rational straight line DE;
therefore MD is also rational and incommensurable in length
with DE.
[x. 22]
For the same reason,
MG is also rational and incommensurable in length with ML,
that is, with DE;
therefore each of the straight lines DM, MG is rational and
incommensurable in length with DE.
And, since AC is incommensurable in length with CB,
and, as A C is to CB, so is the square on A C to the rectangle
AC CB,
therefore the square on AC is also incommensurable with the
rectangle AC, CB.
fx. n ]
Hence the sum of the squares on AC, CB is incommen­
surable with twice the rectangle AC,'CB,
[x. 12, 13]
that is, DL is incommensurable with ME,
so that DM is also incommensurable with MG.
[vi. r, x. 11]
And they are rational;
therefore DG is binomial.
[x. 36]
It is to be proved that it is also a third binomial straight line.
In manner similar to the foregoing we may conclude that
DM is greater than MG,
and that DK is commensurable with KM.
And the rectangle DK, KM is equal to the square on
MN;
therefore the square on DM is greater than the square on
MG by the square on a straight line commensurable with
DM.
And neither of the straight lines DM, MG is commen­
surable in length with DE.
Therefore DG is a third binomial straight line. [x. Deff. 11. 3 ]
