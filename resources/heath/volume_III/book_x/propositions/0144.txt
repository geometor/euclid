and to DE let there be applied the parallelogram DF equal
to the square on AB and producing DG as its breadth ;
I say that DG is a fourth binomial
straight line.

Let the same construction be
made as before shown.
Then, since AB is a major
straight line divided at C,
HL
AC, CB are straight lines incom­
mensurable in square which make
the sum of the squares on them
rational, but the rectangle contained by them medial.
[x. 39]
Since then the sum of the squares on AC, CB is rational,
therefore DL is rational;
therefore DM is also rational and commensurable in length
with DE.

Again, since twice the rectangle AC, CB, that is, ME, is
medial,
and it is applied to the rational straight line ML,
therefore MG is also rational and incommensurable in length
with DE ;
[x. 2 2 ]
therefore DM is also incommensurable in length with MG.
[*• 13]

Therefore DM, MG are rational straight lines commen­
surable in square only ;
therefore DG is binomial.
[x. 36]
It is to be proved that it is also a fourth binomial straight line.
In manner similar to the foregoing we can prove that
DM is greater than MG,
and that the rectangle DK, KM is equal to the square on MN.
Since then the square on AC is incommensurable with the
square on CB,
therefore DH is also incommensurable with KL,
so that DK is also incommensurable with KM.
[vi. 1, x. u ]
But, if there be two unequal straight lines, and to the
greater there be applied a parallelogram equal to the fourth
part of the square on the less and deficient by a square
figure, and if it divide it into incommensurable parts, then the
