square on the greater will be greater than the square on the
less by the square on a straight line incommensurable in
length with the greater;
[x. 18]
therefore the square on DM is greater than the square on
MG by the square on a straight line incommensurable with
DM.
And DM, MG are rational straight lines commensurable
in square only,
and DM is commensurable with the rational straight line DE
set out.
Therefore DG is a fourth binomial straight line. [x. Deff. 11. 4 ]
Q. E. D.

We have to prove that [cf. x . 3 9 ]

is a fourth binomial straight line.
For brevity we must call this expression

Take x, y, 2 such that
ax = u*
ay = 7^
a. 2Z = 2UV
wherein it has to be remembered [ x . 3 9 ] that u, v are incommensurable in
square, ( « + t?) is rational, and uv is medial.
a

(o)

(u' + v*), and therefore a (x +y), is rational;

therefore

(x +y) is rational and « a

(1).

2uji, and therefore a. 2z, is medial;
therefore

22 is rational and ^ a

(2).

Thus

(x +y), 22 are rational and

(3),

so that (x +y) + 22 is a binomial straight line.
(/3)

As before,

and

x+y>

22,

xy = z\
Now, since u' o v*,

Hence [x. 18]

J(x+y)'-(2zf

~(x+y)

And (x +y) « a, by (1).
Therefore [(3), ( 4 ) ] (x +y) + 22 is a fourth binomial straight line.
It is of course
