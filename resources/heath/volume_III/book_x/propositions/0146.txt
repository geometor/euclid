The square on the side of a rational plus a medial area
applied to a rational straight line produces as breadth the fifth
binomial.
Let AB be the side of a rational plus a medial area,
divided into its straight lines at C,
so that A C is the greater ;
D
K M
let a rational straight line DE be set
out,
and let there be applied to DE the
parallelogram DE equal to the square
H L
on AB, producing DG as its breadth;
I say that DG is a fifth binomial
straight line.
Let the same construction as before be made.
Since then AB is the side of a rational plus a medial
area, divided at C,
therefore AC, CB are straight lines incommensurable in square
which make the sum of the squares on them medial, but the
rectangle contained by them rational.
[x. 40]
Since then the sum of the squares on AC, CB is medial,
therefore DL is medial,
so that DM is rational and incommensurable in length with
DE.
[x. 22]
Again, since twice the rectangle A C, CB, that is ME, is
rational,
therefore MG is rational and commensurable with DE. [x. 20]
Therefore DM is incommensurable with MG ;
[x. 13]
therefore DM, MG are rational straight lines commensurable
in square only;
therefore DG is binomial.

I say next that it is also a fifth binomial straight line.
F o r it can be proved similarly that the rectangle DK, KM
is equal to the square on MN,
and that DK is incommensurable in length with KM;
therefore the square on DM is greater than the square on MG
by the square on a straight line incommensurable with DM.
