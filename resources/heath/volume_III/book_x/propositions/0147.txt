And DM, MG are commensurable in square only, and the
less, MG, is commensurable in length with DE.
Therefore DG is a fifth binomial.

therefore

(x + y) is rational and ^ a

Next, a . 2 2 is rational;

Thus

2 2 is rational and •» <r

The square on the side of the sum of two medial areas
applied to a rational straight line produces as breadth the
sixth binomial.
Let AB be the side of the sum of two medial
divided at C,

areas,

let DE be a rational straight line,
and let there be applied to DE the parallelogram DE
to the Square on AB, producing DG as its breadth ;
