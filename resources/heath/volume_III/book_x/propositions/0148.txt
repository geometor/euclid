I say that DG is a sixth binomial straight line.
F o r let the same construction be made as before.
Then, since AB is the side of
the sum of two medial areas, divided

therefore A C, CB are straight lines
incommensurable in square which

by them medial, and moreover the

sum of the squares on them incom­
mensurable with the rectangle contained by them,
[x. 41]
so that, in accordance with what was before proved, each of
the rectangles DL, MF is medial.
And they are applied to the rational straight line

DE;

therefore each of the straight lines DM, MG is rational and
incommensurable in length with DE.
[x. 22]
And, since the sum of the squares on A C, CB is incom­
mensurable with twice the rectangle A C, CB,
therefore DL is incommensurable with MF.
Therefore DM is also incommensurable with MG;
[vi. I , x. I l ]
therefore DM, MG are rational straight lines commensurable
in square only;

therefore DG is binomial.

[x. 36]

I say next that it is also a sixth binomial straight line.
Similarly again we can prove that the rectangle DK, KM
is equal to the square on MN,
and that DK is incommensurable in length with

KM;

and, for the same reason, the square on DM is greater than
the square on MG by the square on a straight line incom­
mensurable in length with DM. •
And neither of the straight lines DM, MG is commen­
surable in length with the rational straight line DE set out.
Therefore DG is a sixth binomial straight line.
