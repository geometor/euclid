by x . 4 1 , u v v , (u + v ) is medial,
(u + V ) v/ 2»t/.
(a) In this case 0- (x +y) is medial;
therefore
(x +y) is rational and
oIn like manner,
2 z is rational and
<r
And, since a (x + y) « a-. 2z,
(x+y) ^ 2 z
Therefore (x+y) + 2Z is a binomial straight line.
(p) As before,
x +y > 2 z ,

Hence [(1), ( 2 ) , (3), (4)] (x +y) + z is a sixth binomial straight line.

^4 straight line commensurable in length with a binomial
straight line is itself also binomial and the same in order.
Let AB be binomial, and let CD be commensurable in
length with AB;

I say that CD is binomial and the same in order with AB.
For, since AB is binomial,
let it be divided into its terms at E,
and let AE be the greater term ;
