therefore AE, EB are rational straight lines commensurable
in square only.
[x. 36]
Let it be contrived that,
as AB is to CD, so is AE to CF;
[vi. 12]
therefore also the remainder EB is to the remainder FD as
AB is to CD.
[v. 19]
But AB is commensurable in length with CD;
therefore AE is also commensurable with CF, and EB with
FD.
[x. . 1 ]
And A E, EB are rational;
therefore CF, FD are also rational.
And, as AE is to CF, so is EB to FD.
[v. n ]
Therefore, alternately, as AE is to EB, so is CF to
[v. 16]
But v^Z?, EB are commensurable in square only ;
therefore CF, FD are also commensurable in square only.

,

And they are rational;
therefore CZ? is binomial.

[x. 36]

I say next that it is the same in order with AB.
F o r the square on AE is greater than the square on EB
either by the square on a straight line commensurable with
AE or by the square on a straight line incommensurable
with it.
I f then the square on AE is greater than the square on
EB by the square on a straight line commensurable with AE,
the square on CF will also be greater than the square on FD
by the square on a straight line commensurable with CF.
[x. 14]
And, if AE is commensurable with the rational straight
line set out, CF will also be commensurable with it,
[x. 12]
and for this reason each of the straight lines AB, CD is a
first binomial, that is, the same in order.
[x. Deft*, ti. 1]
But, if EB is commensurable with the rational straight line
set out, FD is also commensurable with it,
[x. 12]
and for this reason again CD will be the same in order with
AB,
for each of them will be a second binomial.
