But, if neither of the straight lines AE, EB is commen­
surable with the rational straight line set out, neither of the
straight lines CF, FD will be commensurable with it, [x. 13]
and each of the straight lines AB, CD is a third binomial.
[x. Deff. II. 3 ]

But, if the square on AE is greater than the square on
EB by the square on a straight line incommensurable with
AE,
the square on CF is also greater than the square on FD by
the square on a straight line incommensurable with CF. [x. 14]
And, if AE is commensurable with the rational straight
line set out, CF is also commensurable with it,
and each of the straight lines AB, CD is a fourth binomial.
[x. Deff. 11. 4 ]

But, if EB is so commensurable, so is FD also,
and each of the straight lines AB, CD will be a fifth binomial.
[x. Deff. 11. 5 ]
But, if neither of the straight lines AE, EB is so com­
mensurable, neither of the straight lines CF, FD is commen­
surable with the rational straight line set out,
and each of the straight lines AB, CD will be a sixth binomial.
[x. Deff. 11. 6 ]

Hence a straight line commensurable in length with a
binomial straight line is binomial and the same in order.

T h e proofs of this and the following propositions up to x. 7 0 inclusive are
easy and require no elucidation. They are equivalent to saying that, if in each
of the preceding irrational straight lines -g, p is substituted for p, the resulting
irrational is of the same kind as that from which it is altered.

A straight line commensurable in length with a bimedial
straight line is itself also bimedial and the same in order.
Let AB be bimedial, and let CD be commensurable in
length with AB;
I say that CD is bimedial and the same

in order with AB.

For, since AB is bimedial,
let it be divided into its medials at E;
