A straight line commensurable with a major
line is itself also major.

straight

Let AB be major, and let CD be commensurable with AB;
I say that CD is major.
Let AB be divided at E;
therefore AE, EB are straight lines incommensur­
able in square which make the sum of the squares
on them rational, but the rectangle contained by
them medial.
[x. 39]
Let the same construction be made as before.
Then since, as AB is to CD, so is AE to CF, and EB
to FD,
therefore also, as AE is to CF, so is EB to FD.
[v. » ]
But AB is commensurable with CD;
therefore AE, EB are also commensurable with CF, FD
respectively.
[x. n ]
And since, as AE is to CF, so is EB to FD,
alternately also,
as AE is to EB, so is CF to FD ;
[v. 16]
therefore also, componendo,
as AB is to BE, so is CD to DF;
[v. 18]
therefore also, as the square on AB is to the square on BE,
so is the square on CD to the square on DF.
[vi. 20]
Similarly we can prove that, as the square on AB is to
the square on AE, so also is the square on CD to the square
on CF.
Therefore also, as the square on AB is to the squares on
AE, EB, so is the square on CD to the squares on CF. FD;
therefore also, alternately,
as the square on AB is to the square on CD, so are the
squares on AE, EB to the squares on CF, FD.
[v. 16]
But the square on AB is commensurable with the square
on CD;
therefore the squares on AE, EB are also commensurable
with the squares on CF, FD.
