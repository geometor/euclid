And the squares on AE, EB together are rational;
therefore the squares on CF, FD together are rational.
" Similarly also twice the rectangle AE, EB is commen­
surable with twice the rectangle CF, FD.
And twice the rectangle AE, EB is medial;
therefore twice the rectangle CF, FD is also medial.
[x. 23, Por.]
Therefore CF, FD are straight lines incommensurable in
square which make, at the same time, the sum of the squares
on them rational, but the rectangle contained by them medial;
therefore the whole CD is the irrational straight line called
major.
[x. 39]
Therefore a straight line commensurable with the major
straight line is major.

PROPOSITION

69.

A straight line commensurable with the side of a rational
plus a medial area is itself also the side of a rational plus a
medial area.
Let AB be the side of a rational plus a medial area,
and let CD be commensurable with AB;
it is to be proved that CD is also the side of a
rational plus a medial area.
Let AB be divided into its straight lines at E;
therefore AE, EB are straight lines incommensur­
able in square which make the sum of the squares
on them medial, but the rectangle contained by them
rational.
[x. 40]
Let the same construction be made as before.
W e can then prove similarly that
CF, FD are incommensurable in square,
and the sum of the squares on AE, EB is commensurable
with the sum of the squares on CF, FD,
and the rectangle AE, EB with the rectangle CF, FD;
so that the sum of the squares on CF, FD is also medial, and
the rectangle CF, FD rational.
Therefore CD is the side of a rational plus a medial area.
