A straight line commensurable with the side of the sum
of two medial areas is the side of the sum of two medial areas.
Let AB be the side of the sum of two medial areas, and
CD commensurable with AB ;
it is to be proved that CD is also the side of the
sum of two medial areas.
For, since AB is the side of the sum of two
medial areas,
let it be divided into its straight lines at E;
therefore AE, EB are straight lines incommensur­
able in square which make the sum of the squares
on them medial, the rectangle contained by them
medial, and furthermore the sum of the squares on AE, EB
incommensurable with the rectangle AE, EB.
[x. 41]
Let the same construction be made as before.
W e can then prove similarly that
CF, FD are also incommensurable in square,
the sum of the squares on AE, EB is commensurable with
the sum of the squares on CF, FD,
and the rectangle AE, EB with the rectangle CF, FD;
so that the sum of the squares on CF, FD is also medial,
the rectangle CF, FD is medial,
and moreover the sum of the squares on CF, FD is incom­
mensurable with the rectangle CF, FD.
Therefore CD is the side of the sum of two medial areas.

If a rational and a medial area be added together, four
irrational straight lines arise, namely a binomial or a first
bimedial or a major or a side of a rational plus a medial
area.
Let.AB be rational, and CD medial;
I say that the "side" of the area AD is a binomial or a first
bimedial or a major or a side of a rational plus a medial
area.
