[x. 71

For IB is either greater or less than CD.
First, let it be greater ;
let a rational straight line EF be set out,
let there be applied to EF the rectangle EG equal to AB,
producing EH as breadth,
and let HI, equal to DC, be applied to EF, producing HK
as breadth.

Then, since AB is rational and is equal to EG,
therefore EG is also rational.
And it has been applied to EF, producing EH as breadth;
therefore EH is rational and commensurable in length with
EF.
[x. 20]
Again, since CD is medial and is equal to HI,
therefore HI is also medial.
And it is applied to the rational straight line EF, pro­
ducing HK as breadth;
therefore HK is rational and incommensurable in length
with EF
[x. 22]
And, since CD is medial,
while AB is rational,
therefore AB is incommensurable with CD,
so that EG is also incommensurable with HI.
But, as EG is to HI, so is EH to HK;
[vi. 1]
therefore EH is also incommensurable in length with HK.

And both are rational;
therefore EH, HK are rational straight lines commensurable
in square only;
therefore EK is a binomial straight line, divided at H. [x. 36]
