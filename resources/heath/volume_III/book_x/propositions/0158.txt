First, let the square on it be greater by the square on a
straight line commensurable in length with itself.
Now the lesser straight line EH is commensurable in
length with the rational straight line EF set out;
therefore EK is a second binomial.
[x. Deff. 11. 2]
But EF is rational,
and, if an area be contained by a rational straight line and
the second binomial, the side o f the square equal to it is a
first bimedial;
fx- 55]
therefore the "side" of the area EI is a first bimedial,
so that the "side" of AD is also a first bimedial.
Next, let the square on HK be greater than the square
on HE by the square on a straight line incommensurable
with HK.
Now the lesser straight line EH is commensurable with
the rational straight line EF set out;
therefore EK is a fifth binomial.
[x. Deff. n. 5]
But EF is rational;
and, if an area be contained by a rational straight line and the
fifth binomial, the side o f the square equal to the area is a
side o f a rational plus a medial area.
[x. 58]
Therefore the "side" of the area EI is a side of a rational
plus a medial area,
so that the "side" of the area AD is also a side of a rational
plus a medial area.
Therefore etc.
Q. E. D.

1

A rational area being of the form ftp , and a medial area of the form
J \ . p , the problem is to classify
2

according to the different possible relations between k, X.
Put
<ru = kp\

<rv = J\. p .
2

Then, since the former rectangle is rational, the latter medial,
u is rational and « cr,
v is rational and ^ <r.
Also the rectangles are incommensurable;
so that
u u v.
Hence u, v are rational and *•>-;
whence ( « + v) is a binomial straight line.
