The possibilities now are as follows :
I.

a > v.
Then either
(1)

Ju* — p* «"> u,

or ( 2 ) Ju'-t/
V, a,
while in both cases a « o-.
In case ( 1 ) (a + zi) is a
binomial straight line,
and in case ( 2 ) (a +?>) is a fourth binomial straight line.
Thus vV(a + v) is either (1) a binomial straight line [ x . 5 4 ] or ( 2 ) a major
irrational straight line [ x . 5 7 ] .
II.

v>u.
Then either

while in both cases v ^ <r, but a «<r.
Hence, in case (1), (v + « ) is a ftw/zi binomial straight line,
and, in case ( 2 ) , (?' + 11) is a b i n o m i a l straight line.
Thus Ja (v + a) is either ( 1 ) a first bimedial straight line [ x . 55], or ( 2 ) a

side of a rational plus a medial area [x. 58].
PROPOSITION

72.

If two medial areas incommensurable with one another be
added together, the remaining two irrational straight lines
arise, namely either a second bimedial or a side of the sum of
two medial areas.
For let two medial areas AB, CD incommensurable with
one another be added together ;
I say that the "side" of the area AD is either a second
bimedial or a side of the sum of two medial areas.

For AB is either greater or less than CD.
First, if it so chance, let AB be greater than CD.
Let the rational straight line EF be set out,
and to EF let there be applied the rectangle EG equal to
