AB and producing EH as breadth, and the rectangle HI
equal to CD and producing HK as breadth.
Now, since each of the areas AB, CD is medial,
therefore each of the areas EG, HI is also medial.
And they are applied to the rational straight line EE,
producing EH, HK as breadth ;
therefore each of the straight lines EH, HK is rational and
'ncommensurable in length with EE.
[x. 22]
And, since AB is incommensurable with CD,
and AB is equal to EG, and CD to HI,
therefore EG is also incommensurable with HI.
But, as EG is to HI, so is EH to HK;
[vi- 1 ]
therefore EH is incommensurable in length with HK. [x. n ]
Therefore EH, HK are rational straight lines commen­
surable in square only ;
therefore EK is binomial.

But the square on EH is greater than the square on HK
either by the square on a straight line commensurable with
EH or by the square on a straight line incommensurable
with it.
First, let the square on it be greater by the square on a
straight line commensurable in length with itself.
Now neither of the straight lines EH, HK is commen­
surable in length with the rational straight line EF set out;
therefore EK is a third binomial.
[x. Deff. it. 3 ]
But EF is rational;
and, if an area be contained by a rational straight line and the
third binomial, the "side" of the area is a second bimedial;
fx- 56]
therefore the "side" of EI, that is, of AD, is a second bimedial.
Next, let the square on EH be greater than the square
on HK by the square on a straight line incommensurable in
length with EH.
Now each of the straight lines EH, HK is incommen­
surable in length with EF;
therefore EK is a sixth binomial.

But, if an area be contained by a rational straight line and
