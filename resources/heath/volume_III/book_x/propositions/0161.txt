the sixth binomial, the "side" of the area is the side of the
sum of two medial areas;
[x. 59]
so that the "side" of the area AD is also the side of the
sum of two medial areas.
Therefore etc.
Q. E. D.


E. D.

We have to classify, according to the different possible relations between
k, \, the straight line
where Jh. p- and JS.. p- are incommensurable.
2

era = Jk. p ,

Suppose that

av = ij\. p".
2

It is immaterial whether Jk. p or J\. p" is the greater.
that the former is.
2

Suppose, e.g.,

2

Now, Jk. p , J \ . p being both medial areas, and cr rational,
u, v are both rational and ^ cr
Again, by hypothesis,
or

era ^ av,
«u »

(1).
(2).

Hence [(1), (2)] (a + v) is a binomial straight line.
Next, \/u* -v* is either commensurable or incommensurable in length
with u.
Suppose Ju* - v* is u.
In this case (a + v) is a third binomial straight line,
and therefore [ x . 5 6 ]
(a)

Vo- (a + v) is a second bimedial straight line.
(0)
UsJu^F^u,
(u + v) is a sixth binomial straight line,
and therefore [x. 5 9 ]
J a (a + v) is a side of the sum of two medial areas.

T h e binomial straight line and the irrational straight lines
after it are neither the same with the medial nor with one
another.
For the square on a medial, if applied to a rational straight
line, produces as breadth a straight line rational and incom­
mensurable in length with that to which it is applied.
[x. 22]
But the square on the binomial, if applied to a rational
straight line, produces as breadth the first binomial.
[x. 60]
T h e square on the first bimedial, if applied to a rational
straight line, produces as breadth the second binomial, [x. 61]
