T h e square on the second bimedial, if applied to a rational
straight line, produces as breadth the third binomial.
[x. 62]
T h e square on the major, if applied to a rational straight
line, produces as breadth the fourth binomial.
[x. 63]
T h e square on the side of a rational plus a medial area, if
applied to a rational straight line, produces as breadth the fifth
binomial.
[x. 64]
T h e square on the side of the sum of two medial areas, if
applied to a rational straight line, produces as breadth the
sixth binomial.
[x. 65]
And the said breadths differ both from the first and from
one another: from the first because it is rational, and from
one another because they are not the same in order;
so that the irrational straight lines themselves also differ from
one another.
T h e explanation after x. 72 is for the purpose of showing that all the
irrational straight lines treated hitherto are different from one another, viz. the
medial, the six irrational straight lines beginning with the binomial, and the
six consisting of the first, second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth binomials.

PROPOSITION

73.

If from a rational straight line there be subtracted a
rational straight line commensurable with the whole in square
only, the remainder is irrational; and let it be called an
apotome.
F o r from the rational straight line AB let the rational
straight line BC, commensurable with
the whole in square only, be subA
is
B
tracted ;
I say that the remainder AC is the irrational straight line
called a p o t o m e .
For, since AB is incommensurable in length with BC,
and, as AB is to BC, so is the square on AB to the rectangle
AB, BC,
therefore the square on AB is incommensurable with the
rectangle AB, BC.

But the squares on AB, BC are commensurable with the
square on AB,

and twice the rectangle AB, BC is commensurable with the
rectangle AB, BC.
