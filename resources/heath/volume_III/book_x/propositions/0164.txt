I say that the remainder A C is irrational; and let it be
called a first a p o t o m e of a m e d i a l straight line.
For, since AB, BC are medial,
the squares on AB,

BC are also medial.

But twice the rectangle AB, BC is rational;
therefore the squares on AB, BC are incommensurable with
twice the rectangle AB, BC;
therefore twice the rectangle AB, BC is also incommensurable
with the remainder, the square on A C,
[cf. H. 7]
since, if the whole is incommensurable with one of the magni­
tudes, the original magnitudes will also be incommensurable.

But twice the rectangle AB, BC is rational;
therefore the square on A C is irrational;
therefore AC is irrational.

[x. Def. 4]

And let it be called a first a p o t o m e of a m e d i a l straight
line.
T h e first apotome of a medial straight line is the difference between straight
lines of the form k^p, $p, which are medial straight lines commensurable in
square only and forming a rational rectangle.
By hypothesis, x\ y* are medial areas.
And, since xy is rational,

(X? +y') « xy
v

whence

2xy,

<x -y)* ^ 2xy.

But 2xy is rational;
therefore (x-

2

y) , and consequently (x-y),

is irrational.

This irrational, which is of the form ($p ~ $p), is the first apotome of a
medial straight line; the term corresponding of course to first bimedial, which
applies where the sign is positive.
