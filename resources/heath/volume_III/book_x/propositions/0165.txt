If from a medial straight line there be subtracted a medial
straight line which is commensurable with the whole in square
only, and which contains with the whole a medial rectangle,
the retnainder is irrational; and let it be called a s e c o n d
a p o t o m e of a m e d i a l straight line.
For from the medial straight line AB let there be sub­
tracted the medial straight line CB which is commensurable
with the whole AB in square only and such that the rectangle
AB, BC, which it contains with the whole AB, is medial; [x. 28]
I say that the remainder AC is irrational; and let it be called
a s e c o n d a p o t o m e of a m e d i a l straight line.

For let a rational straight line DI be set out,
let DE equal to the squares on AB, BC be applied to DI,
producing DG as breadth,
and let DH equal to twice the rectangle AB, BC be applied
to DI, producing DF as breadth ;
therefore the remainder FE is equal to the square on AC.
["• 7 ]

Now, since the squares on AB, BC are medial and
commensurable,
therefore DE is also medial.
[x. 15 and 23, Por.]
And it is applied to the rational straight line DI, producing
DG as breadth ;
therefore DG is rational and incommensurable in length
with DI.
[x. 22]
Again, since the rectangle AB, BC is medial,
therefore twice the rectangle AB, BC is also medial.
