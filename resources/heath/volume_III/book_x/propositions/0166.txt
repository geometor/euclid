And it is equal to DH;
therefore DH is also medial.
And it has been applied to the rational straight line DI,
producing DF as breadth ;
therefore DF is rational and incommensurable in length
with DI.
[x. 22]
And, since AB, BC are commensurable in square only,
therefore AB is incommensurable in length with BC;
therefore the square on AB is also incommensurable with the
rectangle AB, BC.
[x. i i ]
But the squares on AB, BC are commensurable with the
square on AB,
[x. 15]
and twice the rectangle AB, BC is commensurable with the
rectangle AB, BC;
[x. 6]
therefore twice the rectangle AB, BC is incommensurable with
the squares on AB, BC.
[x. 13]
But DE is equal to the squares on AB, BC,
and DH to twice the rectangle AB, BC;
therefore DE is incommensurable with DH.
But, as DE is to DH, so is GD to DF;
[vi. 1]
therefore GD is incommensurable with DF.
[x. 11]
And both are rational;
therefore GD, DFare
rational straight lines commensurable
in square only;
therefore FG is an apotome.
[x. 73]
But DI is rational,
and the rectangle contained by a rational and an irrational
straight line is irrational,
[deduction from x. 20]
and its "side" is irrational.
And AC is the "side" of FE;
therefore A C is irrational.
And let it be called a s e c o n d a p o t o m e of a m e d i a l
straight line.

W e have here the difference between M*p, J \ . pjk*, two medial straight
lines commensurable in square only and containing a medial rectangle.
Apply each of the areas (x'+y ),
2xy to a rational straight line cr, i.e.
suppose that

x + y = era,
2xy = av.
