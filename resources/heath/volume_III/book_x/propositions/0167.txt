PROPOSITION

If from a straight line there be subtracted a straight line
which is incommensurable in square with the whole and which
with the whole makes the squares on them added together
rational, but the rectangle contained by them medial, the
remainder is irrational; and let it be called m i n o r .
For from the straight line AB let there be subtracted the
straight line BC which is incom­
mensurable in square with the whole
A"
&
B
and fulfils the given conditions.
[x. 33]
I say that the remainder AC is the irrational straight line
called m i n o r .
For, since the sum of the squares on AB, BC is rational,
while twice the rectangle AB, BC is medial,
therefore the squares on AB, BC are incommensurable with
twice the rectangle AB, BC;
and, convertendo, the squares on AB, BC are incommensurable
with the remainder, the square on AC.
[11. 7, x . 16]
But the squares on AB, BC are rational;
therefore the square on A C is irrational ;
therefore AC is irrational.
And let it be called m i n o r .
