PROPOSITION

77.

If from a straight line there be subtracted a straight line
which is incommensurable in square with the whole, and which
with the whole makes the sum of the squares on them medial,
but twice the rectangle contained by them rational, the remainder
is irrational: and let it be called t h a t w h i c h p r o d u c e s w i t h
a rational area a medial whole.
F o r from the straight line AB let there be subtracted the
straight line BC which is incommensurable in square
with AB and fulfils the given conditions ;
[x. 34]
I say that the remainder AC is the irrational straight
line aforesaid.
For, since the sum of the squares on AB, BC is
medial,
while twice the rectangle AB, BC is rational,
therefore the squares on AB, BC are. incommensurable
with twice the rectangle AB, BC;
therefore the remainder also, the square on AC, is incom­
mensurable with twice the rectangle AB, BC.
[n. 7, x. 16]
And twice the rectangle AB, BC is rational;
therefore the square on A C is irrational;
therefore AC is irrational.
And let it be called t h a t w h i c h p r o d u c e s w i t h a
rational area a medial whole.
