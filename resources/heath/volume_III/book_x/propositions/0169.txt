literally that which with a rational area makes the whole medial (17 p e ™ ptjrov

is described on it." A clearer way of expressing the meaning would be to call
this straight line the "side" of a medial minus a rational area corresponding
to the "side" of a rational plus a medial area [x. 40].

PROPOSITION 

78.

If from a straight line there be subtracted a straight line
which is incommensurable in square with the whole and which
with the whole makes the sum of the squares on them medial,
twice the rectangle contained by them medial, and further the
squares on them incommensurable with twice the rectangle
contained by them, the remainder is irrational; and let it be
called t h a t w h i c h p r o d u c e s w i t h a m e d i a l a r e a a
medial whole.
For from the straight line AB let there be subtracted the
straight line BC incommensurable in
square with AB and fulfilling the
given conditions ;
[x. 35]
I say that the remainder A C is the
irrational straight line called t h a t
which produces with a medial
area a medial whole.
"
For let a rational straight line DI
A c
B
be set out,
to DI let there be applied DE equal to the squares on AB,
BC, producing DG as breadth,
and let DH equal to twice the rectangle AB, BC be
subtracted.
