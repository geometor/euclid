Therefore
on

the remainder FE

is equal to the square

AC,

[11.7]

so that AC is the " side " of FE.
Now, since the sum of the squares on AB, BC is medial
and is equal to DE,
therefore DE is medial.
And it is applied to the rational straight line DI, producing
DG as breadth;
therefore DG is rational and incommensurable in length
with DI.
[x. 22]
Again, since twice the rectangle AB, BC is medial and is
equal to DH,
therefore DH is medial.
And it is applied to the rational straight line DI, producing
DF as breadth;
therefore DF is also rational and incommensurable in length
with DI.
[x. 22]
And, since the squares on AB, BC are incommensurable
with twice the rectangle AB, BC,
therefore DE is also incommensurable with DH.
But, as DE is to DH, so also is DG to DF;
therefore DG is incommensurable with DF.

[vi. 1]
[x. n ]

And both are rational;
therefore GD, DF are rational straight lines commensurable
in square only.
Therefore FG is an apotome.

[x. 73]

And FH is rational;
but the rectangle contained by a rational straight line and an
apotome is irrational,
[deduction from x. 20]
and its "side" is irrational.
And AC is the "side" of FE;
therefore A C is irrational.
And let it be caljed t h a t w h i c h p r o d u c e s w i t h
medial area a medial whole.
