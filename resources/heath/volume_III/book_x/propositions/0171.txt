Hence [(1), ( 2 ) ] a, v are rational and »>-,

medial area a medial whole, more literally that which with a medial area makes
the whole medial (1) aera. peVou piaov TO O\O>' 7ROIOUCRA). A clearer phrase (to
us) would be the "side" of the difference between two medial areas, correspond­

Proposition

79.

To an apotome only one rational straight line can be
annexed which is commensurable with the whole in square only.
Let A3 be an apotome, and BC an annex to i t ;
therefore AC, CB are rational
straight lines commensurable in
c d
square only.
[x. 73]
'
I say that no other rational
straight line can be annexed to AB which is commensurable
with the whole in square only.
For, if possible, let BD be so annexed ;
therefore AD, DB are also rational straight lines commen­
surable in square only.
[ - 73]
Now, since the excess of the squares on AD, DB over
twice the rectangle AD, DB is also the excess of the squares
on AC, CB over twice the rectangle AC, CB,
for both exceed by the same, the square on AB,
