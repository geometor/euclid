therefore, alternately, the excess of the squares on AD, DB
over the squares on A C, CB is the excess of twice the rect­
angle AD, DB over twice the rectangle A C, CB.
But the squares on AD, DB exceed the squares on AC,
CB by a rational area,
for both are rational;
therefore twice the rectangle AD, DB also exceeds twice the
rectangle A C, CB by a rational area:
which is impossible,
for both are medial [x. 21], and a medial area does not exceed
a medial by a rational area.
[x. 26]
Therefore no other rational straight line can be annexed
to AB which is commensurable with the whole in square only.
Therefore only one rational straight line can be annexed
to an apotome which is commensurable with the whole in
square only.

This proposition proves the equivalent of the well-known theorem of surds
that,
if a — Jb = x — Jy, then a = x, b =y;
and, if Ja - Jb = Jx - Jy, then a = x, b =y.
T h e method of proof corresponds to that of x . 42 for positive signs.
Suppose, if possible, that an apotome can be expressed as (x -y) and also
as (x'—y'), where x, y are rational straight lines commensurable in square only,
and x', y' are so also.
Of x, x', let x be the greater.
Now, since
x —y = x' —y,
x* +y - (x' +y'*) = txy - 2x'y'.
But (x* +y),
(•*'*+/*) are both rational, so that their difference is a
rational area.

On the other hand, 2xy, 2x'y' are both medial areas, being of the form
J6.fr;
therefore the difference between two medial areas is rational:
which is impossible [ x . 26].
Therefore etc.

PROPOSITION

80.

To a first apotome of a medial straight line only one
medial straight line can be annexed which is commensurable
with the whole in square only and which contains with the
whole a rational rectangle.
