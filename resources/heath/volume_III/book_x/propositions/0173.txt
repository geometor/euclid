For let AB be a first apotome of a medial straight line,
and let BC be an annex to AB ;
therefore AC, CB are medial
?
£—straight lines commensurable in
square only and such that the rectangle AC, CB which they
contain is rational;
[x. 74]
I say that no other medial straight line can be annexed to
AB which is commensurable with the whole in square only
and which contains with the whole a rational area.
For, if possible, let DB also be so annexed ;
therefore AD, DB are medial straight lines commensurable
in square only and such that the rectangle AD, DB which
they contain is rational.
[x. 74]
Now, since the excess of the squares on AD, DB over
twice the rectangle AD, DB is also the excess of the squares
on AC, CB over twice the rectangle AC, CB,
for they exceed by the same, the square on AB,
[11. 7]
therefore, alternately, the excess of the squares on AD, DB
over the squares on A C, CB is also the excess of twice the
rectangle AD, DB over twice the rectangle AC, CB.
But twice the rectangle AD, DB exceeds twice the rect­
angle A C, CB by a rational area,
for both are rational.
Therefore the squares on AD, DB also exceed the squares
on A C, CB by a rational area :
which is impossible,
for both are medial [x. 15 and 23, Por.], and a medial area does
not exceed a medial by a rational area.
[x. 26]
Therefore etc.
Q. E. D.


E. D.

Suppose, if possible, that the same first apotome of a medial straight line
can be expressed in terms of the required character in two ways, so that
x —y = x' —y',
and suppose that x > x'.
In this case x* +y*, (x' +y'*) are both medial areas, and 2xy, 2x'y' are both
rational areas;
and
x +y -(x''+/')
= 2xy-2x'y'.
Hence x . 2 6 is contradicted again ;
i

therefore etc.
