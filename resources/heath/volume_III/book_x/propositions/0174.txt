PROPOSITION

8I.

To a second apotome of a medial straight line only one
medial straight line can be annexed which is commensurable
with the whole in square only and which contains with the
whole a medial rectangle.
Let AB be a second apotome of a medial straight line
and BC an annex to AB;
therefore AC, CB are medial straight
C D
lines commensurable in square only and
such that the rectangle AC, CB which
they contain is medial.
[x. 75]
I say that no other medial straight line
can be annexed to AB which is commen­
surable with the whole in square only and
which contains with the whole a medial
rectangle.
For, if possible, let BD also be so
annexed;
therefore AD, DB are also medial straight
lines commensurable in square only and
such that the rectangle AD, DB which
they contain is medial.
[x. 75]
Let a rational straight line EF be set out,
let £G equal to the squares on A C, CB be applied to EF,
producing EM as breadth,
and let HG equal to twice the rectangle AC, CB be sub­
tracted, producing HM as breadth ;
therefore the remainder EL is equal to the square on AB,
[»• 7]

so that AB is the "side" of EL.
Again, let EI equal to the squares on AD, DB be applied
to EF, producing EN as breadth.
But EL is also equal to the square on AB;
therefore the remainder HI is equal to twice the rectangle
AD, DB.
[11. 7]
Now, since AC, CB are medial straight lines,
therefore the squares on A C, CB are also medial.
