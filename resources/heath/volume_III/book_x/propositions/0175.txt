And they are equal to EG;
therefore EG is also medial.
[x. 15 and 23, Por.]
And it is applied to the rational straight line EF, producing
EM as breadth ;
therefore EM is rational and incommensurable in length
with EF.
[x. 22]
Again, since the rectangle A C, CB is medial,
twice the rectangle A C, CB is also medial.
[x. 23, Por.]
And it is equal to HG;
therefore HG is also medial.
And it is applied to the rational straight line EF, producing
HM as breadth;
therefore HM is also rational and incommensurable in length
with EF.
[x. 22]
And, since AC, CB are commensurable in square only,
therefore AC is incommensurable in length with CB.
But, as AC is to CB, so is the square on AC to the rect­
angle AC, CB;
therefore the square on AC is incommensurable with the
rectangle AC, CB.
[x. i x ]
But the squares on AC, CB are commensurable with the
square on AC,
while twice the rectangle AC, CB is commensurable with the
rectangle A C, CB ;
[x. 6 ]
therefore the squares on AC, CB are incommensurable with
twice the rectangle AC, CB.
[x. 13]
And EG is equal to the squares on A C, CB,
while GH is equal to twice the rectangle AC, CB;
therefore EG is incommensurable with HG.
But, as EG is to HG, so is EM to HM;
[vi. 1]
therefore EM is incommensurable in length with MH. [x. 11]
And both are rational;
therefore EM, MH are rational straight lines commensurable
in square only;
therefore EH is an apotome, and HM an annex to it. fx. 73]
