Similarly we can prove that HN is also an annex to it;
therefore to an apotome different straight lines are annexed
which are commensurable with the wholes in square only :

As the irrationality of the second apotome of a medial straight line was
deduced [x. 75] from the irrationality of an apotome, so the present theorem
is reduced to x. 79.
Suppose, if possible, that (x -y), (x' -y') are the same second apotome of
a medial straight line ;
and let (say) x be greater than x'.

Apply (x* +y'), 2xy and also (JC' +_y' ), 2x'y' to a rational straight line a,
i.e. put
2

x*+y* = au 1
2xy = av I

2

* ' + / = oV 1
2x'y' = av' f '

Dealing with (x -y) first, we have:
(x +y>) is a medial area, and 2xy is also a medial area.
Therefore u, v are both rational and ^ a
Also, since x r—y,
x ^ y,
so that
x ^ xy,
whence, as usual,
x + y ^ 2xy,
that is,
era >j av,
and therefore
u « v
Thus [(1) and (2)] u, v are rational and

so that ( » — v) is ah apotome.
Similarly («' - v') is proved to be the same apotome.
Hence this apotome is formed in two ways:
which contradicts x. 79.
Therefore the original hypothesis is false, and a second apotome of a
medial straight line is uniquely formed.

To a minor straight line only one straight line can be
annexed which is incommensurable in square with the whole
and which makes, with the whole, the sum of the squares on
them rational but twice the rectangle contained by them medial.
L e t AB be the minor straight line, and let BC be an
annex to AB;
therefore AC, CB are straight
