which make the sum of the squares on them rational, but
twice the rectangle contained by them medial.

I say that no other straight line can be annexed to AB
fulfilling the same conditions.
For, if possible, let BD be so annexed ;
therefore AD, DB are also straight lines incommensurable
in square which fulfil the aforesaid conditions.
[x. 76]
Now, since the excess of the squares on AD, DB over
the squares on AC, CB is also the excess of twice the rect­
angle AD, DB over twice the rectangle AC, CB,
while the squares on AD, DB exceed the squares on AC,
CB by a rational area,
for both are rational,
therefore twice the rectangle AD, DB also exceeds twice
the rectangle A C, CB by a rational area:
which is impossible, for both are medial.

Therefore to a minor straight line only one straight
line can be annexed which is incommensurable in square with
the whole and which makes the squares on them added
together rational, but twice the rectangle contained by them
medial.

Suppose, if possible, that, with the usual notation,
x-y =
x-y';
and let x (say) be greater than x'.
In this case (x? +y*), (x' + y ) are both rational areas,
and 2xy, 2x'y' are both medial areas.
But, as before,
(x + y ) - ( x ' +_y' ) = 2xy - 2x'y',
so that the difference between two medial areas is rational:
which is impossible [x. 2 6 ] .
Therefore etc.

PROPOSITION

83.

To a straight line which produces with a rational area a
medial whole only one straight line can be annexed which is
incommensurable in square with the whole straight line and
which with the whole straight line makes the sum of the squares
on them medial, but twice the rectangle contained by them
rational.
