Let AB be the straight line which produces with a rational
area a medial whole,
and let BC be an annex to AB;
P
S_P
therefore A C, CB are straight lines
incommensurable in square which fulfil the given conditions.

[*r 77]

I say that no other straight line can be annexed to AB
which fulfils the same conditions.
For, if possible, let BD be so annexed ;
therefore AD, DB are also straight lines incommensurable in
square which fulfil the given conditions.
[x. 77]
Since then, as in the preceding cases,
the excess of the squares on AD, DB over the squares on
AC, CB is also the excess of twice the rectangle AD, DB
over twice the rectangle A C, CB,
while twice the rectangle AD, DB exceeds twice the rectangle
AC, CB by a rational area,
for both are rational,
therefore the squares on AD, DB also exceed the squares
on A C, CB by a rational area:
which is impossible, for both are medial.
[x. 26]
Therefore no other straight line can be annexed to AB
which is incommensurable in square with the whole and which
with the whole fulfils the aforesaid conditions;
therefore only one straight line can be so annexed.
Q. E. D.


E. D.

Suppose, with the same notation, that
x-y =x —y.
(x > x')
Here, (x*+y), (x'^+y'*) being both medial areas, and 2xy, ix'y' both
rational areas,
while
(x +y*) — (#' +y'*) = 2xy - 2x'y',
x. 26 is contradicted again.
Therefore etc.

PROPOSITION

84.

To a straight line which produces with a medial area a
medial whole only one straight line can de annexed which is
incommensurable in square with the whole straight line and
which with the whole straight line makes the sum of the squares
