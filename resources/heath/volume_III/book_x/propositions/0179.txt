on them medial and twice the rectangle contained by them both
medial and also incommensurable with the sum of the squares
on them.
Let AB be the straight line which produces with a medial
area a medial, whole,
and BL an annex to it;
therefore AC, CBare straight lines incommensurable in square
which fulfil the aforesaid conditions.

I say that no other straight line can be annexed to AB
which fulfils the aforesaid conditions.
For, if possible, let BD be so annexed,
so that AD, DB are also straight lines incommensurable in
square which make the squares on AD, DB added together
medial, twice the rectangle AD, DB medial, and also the
squares on AD, DB incommensurable with twice the rectangle
AD, DB.
[x. 78]
Let a rational straight line EF be set out,
let EG equal to the squares on AC, CB be applied to EF,
producing EM as breadth,
and let HG equal to twice the rectangle AC, CB be applied
to EF, producing HM as breadth ;
therefore the remainder, the square on AB [n. 7], is equal
to EL ;
therefore AB is the "side" of EL.
Again, let EI equal to the squares on AD, DB be applied
to EF, producing EN as breadth.
But the square on AB is also equal to EL ;
therefore the remainder, twice the rectangle AD, DB [11. 7],
is equal to HI.
