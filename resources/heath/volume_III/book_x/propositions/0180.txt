Now, since the sum of the squares on AC, CB is medial
and is equal to EG,
therefore EG is also medial.
And it is applied to the rational straight line EF, pro­
ducing EM as breadth ;
therefore EM is rational and incommensurable in length
with EF.
[x. 22]
Again, since twice the rectangle AC, CB is medial and is
equal to HG,
therefore HG is also medial.
And it is applied to the rational straight line EF, pro­
ducing HM as breadth ;
therefore HM
with EF.

is rational and incommensurable in length
[x. 22]

And, since the squares on AC, CB are incommensurable
with twice the rectangle A C, CB,
EG is also incommensurable with HG;
therefore EM is also incommensurable in length with MH.
[vi. I, x. 11]
And both are rational;
therefore EM, MH are rational straight lines commensurable
in square only;
therefore EH is an apotome, and HM an annex to it.

[x. 73]

Similarly we can prove that EH is again an apotome and
an annex to it.
Therefore to an apotome different rational straight lines
are annexed which are commensurable with the wholes in
square only:
HN

which was proved impossible.

[x. 79]

Therefore no other straight line can be so annexed to AB.
Therefore to AB only one straight line can be annexed
which is incommensurable in square with the whole and which
with the whole makes the squares on them added together
medial, twice the rectangle contained by them medial, and
also the squares on them incommensurable with twice the
rectangle contained by them.
