With the usual notation, suppose that

Let

x -y = x -y'.
(x > xf)
x +y* = <ru 1
, x'* + «*• = au' )
\ and
f, ,
, \.
2xy = <rv J
2xy =<rv )
,

Consider (x -y) first;
it follows, since (x* +y*), ixy are both medial areas, that
u, v are both rational and w <r
But
x* +y* w 2xy,
that is,
au w av,
and therefore
u^ v
Therefore [ ( 1 ) and (2)] u, v are rational and » y ;

(1).

(a).

hence (u — v) is an apotome.
Similarly (»' - tf) is proved to be the same apotome.
Thus the same apotome is formed as such in two ways:
which is impossible [ x . 79].
Therefore, etc.
DEFINITIONS III.

1. Given a rational straight line and an apotome, if the
square on the whole be greater than the square on the annex
by the square on a straight line commensurable in length with
the whole, and the whole be commensurable in length with
the rational straight line set out, let the apotome be called a
first a p o t o m e .
2. But if the annex be commensurable in length with
the rational straight line set out, and the square on the whole
be greater than that on the annex by the square on a straight
line commensurable with the whole, let the apotome be called
a second apotome.
3. But if neither be commensurable in length with the
rational straight line set out, and the square on the whole be
greater than the square on the annex by the square on a
straight line commensurable with the whole, let the apotome
be called a t h i r d a p o t o m e .
4. Again, if the square on the whole be greater than
the square on the annex by the square on a straight line
incommensurable with the whole, then, if the whole be com­
mensurable in length with the rational straight line set out,
let the apotome be called a f o u r t h a p o t o m e ;
