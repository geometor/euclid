But DE has to EF the ratio which a square number has
to a square number,
for each is square ;
therefore the square on GB also has to the square on H the
ratio which a square number has to a square number;
therefore BG is commensurable in length with H.

[x. 9]

And the square on BG is greater than the square on GC
by the square on H;
therefore the square on BG is greater than the square on GC
by the square on a straight line commensurable in length
with BG.
And the whole BG is commensurable in length with the
rational straight line A set out.
Therefore BC is a first apotome.
[ x . Deff. In. 1]
Therefore the first apotome BC has been found.
(Being) that which it was required to find.
Take kp commensurable in length with 0, the given rational straight line.

Let m , n' be square numbers such that (m* - n') is not square.
Take x such that

m*: (m>-n') ^Pp'-.x*

so that

x = kp

• kp V i - A , say.
Then shall kp - x, or kp -kp -Ji-X',

be afirstapotome.

For (a) it follows irom ( 1 ) that x is rational but incommensurable with kp,
whence kp, x are rational and
so that (kp — x) is an apotome.

m* : n' = k*p :y>,
whence y, that is, %/Pp* — x?, is commensurable in length with kp.
And kp

therefore kp - x i« afirstapotome.
As explained in the note to x. 4 8 , the first apotome
