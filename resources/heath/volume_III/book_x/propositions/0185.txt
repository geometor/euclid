with BG.
And CG, the annex, is commensurable with the rational
straight line A set out.
Therefore BC is a second apotome.
[x. Deff. m. 2]
Therefore the second apotome BC has been found.

Take, as before, kp commensurable in length with p.
Let m , « be again square numbers, but (m' — » ) not square.
Take x such that

Thus y, or Jx^-Pp', is commensurable in length with x.
And kp is « p.
Therefore X — kp is a second apotome.

To find the third apotome.
Let a rational straight line A be set out,
let three numbers E, BC, CD be
