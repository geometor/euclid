and, as BC is to CD, so is the square on FG to the square
[x. 6, Por.]
on GH.
Since then, as E is to BC, so is the square on A to the
square on FG,
therefore the square on A is commensurable with the square
on FG.
[*• 6 ]
But the square on A is rational;
therefore the square on FG is also rational;
therefore FG is rational.
And, since E has not to BC the ratio which a square
number has to a square number,
therefore neither has the square on A to the square on FG
the ratio which a square number has to a square number;
therefore A is incommensurable in length with FG.
[x. 9 ]
Again, since, as BC is to CD, so is the square on FG to
the square on GH,
therefore the square on FG is commensurable with the square
on GH.
[x. 6 ]
But the square on FG is rational;
therefore the square on GH is also rational;
therefore GH is rational.
And, since BC has not to CD the ratio which a square
number has to a square number,
therefore neither has the square on FG to the square on GH
the ratio which a square number has to a square number;
therefore FG is incommensurable in length with GH.
[x. 9]
And both are rational;
therefore FG, GH are rational straight lines commensurable
in square only;
therefore FH is an apotome.
[x. 73]
I say next that it is also a third apotome.
F o r since, as E is to BC, so is the square on A to the
square on FG,
and, as BC is to CD, so is the square on FG to the square
on HG,
therefore, ex aequali, as E is to CD, so is the square on A
to the square on HG.
