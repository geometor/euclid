But E has not to CD the ratio which a square number
has to a square number;
therefore neither has the square on A to the square on GH
the ratio which a square number has to a square number;
therefore A is incommensurable in length with GH.
[x. 9 ]
Therefore neither of the straight lines FG, GH is
commensurable in length with the rational straight line A
set out.
Now let the square on K be that by which the square on
FG is greater than the square on GH.
Since then, as BC is to CD, so is the square on FG to
the square on GH,
therefore, convertendo, as BC is to BD, so is the square on
FG to the square on K.
[v. 19, Por.]
But BC has to BD the ratio which a square number has
to a square number ;
therefore the square on FG also has to the square on K the
ratio which a square number has to a square number.
Therefore FG is commensurable in length with K, fx. 9 ]
and the square on FG is greater than the square on GH by
the square on a straight line commensurable with FG.
And neither of the straight lines FG, GH is commen­
surable in length with the rational straight line A set out;
therefore FH is a third apotome.
[x. Deff. m. 3 ]
Therefore the third apotome FH has been found.
Q. E. D.

Let p be a rational straight line.
Take numbers
qm', q (m' - n') which have not to one another the ratio
of square to square.
Now let x, y be such that

/ : qm' = p' : x'

qm': q (m' - n') m x* : f.

and

Then shall (x —y) be a third apotome.
For (o), from ( 1 ) ,
x is rational but « p
And, from (2), y is rational but w x.
Therefore x, y are rational and
so that (x -y)

is an apotome.

(2).
