whence y ^ p.
Thus, by this and (3), x, y are both w p
Lastly, let z* = x* -y', so that, from (2), convertendo,

To find the fourth apotome.
Let a rational straight line A be set out, and BG com­
mensurable in length with i t ;
therefore BG is also rational.

Q

1

Let two numbers DF, FE be set out such that the whole
DE has not to either of the numbers DF, EF the ratio
which a square number has to a square number.
Let it be contrived that, as DE is to EF, so is the square
on BG to the square on GC;
[x. 6, Por.]
therefore the square on BG is commensurable with the square
on GC.
[x. 6]
But the square on BG is rational;
therefore the square on GC is also rational;
therefore GC is rational.
