Now, since DE has not to EF the ratio which a square
number has to a square number,
therefore neither has the square on BG to the square on GC
the ratio which a square number has to a square number ;
therefore BG is incommensurable in length with GC.
Fx. 9 ]
And both are rational;
therefore BG, GC are rational straight lines commensurable
in square only;
therefore BC is an apotome.
fx. 73]
Now let the square on H be that by which the square on
BG is greater than the square on GC.
Since then, as DE is to EF, so is the square on BG to
the square on GC,
therefore also, convertendo, as ED is to DF, so is the square
on GB to the square on H.
[v. 19, Por.]
But ED has not to DF the ratio which a square number
has to a square number ;
therefore neither has the square on GB to the square on H
the ratio which a square number has to a square number;
therefore BG is incommensurable in length with H.
fx. 9 ]
And the square on BG is greater than the square on GC
by the square on H;
therefore the square on BG is greater than the square on GC
by the square on a straight line incommensurable with BG.
And the whole BG is commensurable in length with the
rational straight line A set out.
Therefore BC is a fourth apotome.
[x. Deff. m. 4 ]
Therefore the fourth apotome has been found.

Beginning with p, kp, as in x . 8 5 , 86, we take numbers m, n such that
(m + n) has not to either of the numbers m, n the ratio of a square number to
a square number.
Take x such that

(m + n):tt
