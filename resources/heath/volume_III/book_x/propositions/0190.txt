PROPOSITION

89.

To find the fifth apotome.
Let a rational straight line A be set out,
and let CG be commensurable in length
with A ;
therefore CG is rational.
Let two numbers DF, FE be set out
such that DE again has not to either of the
numbers DF, FE the ratio which a square
number has to a square number;
and let it be contrived that, as FE is to ED,
so is the square on CG to the square on GB.
Therefore the square on GB is also
rational;
[x. 6 ]
therefore BG is also rational.
Now since, as DE is to EF, so is the square on BG to
the square on GC,
while DE has not to EF the ratio which a square number
has to a square number,
therefore neither has the square on BG to the square on GC
the ratio which a square number has to a square number;
therefore BG is incommensurable in length with GC.
[x. 9 ]
And both are rational;
therefore BG, GC are rational straight lines commensurable
in square only;
therefore BC is an apotome.
