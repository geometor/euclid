I say next that it is also a fifth apotome.
F o r let the square on H be that by which the square on
BG is greater than the square on GC.
Since then, as the square on BG is to the square on GC,
so is DE to EF,
therefore, convertendo, as ED is to DF, so is the square on
BG to the square on H.
[v. 19, Por.]
But ED has not to DF the ratio which a square number
has to a square number ;
therefore neither has the square on BG to the square on H
the ratio which a square number has to a square number;
therefore BG is incommensurable in length with H.

[x. 9 ]

And the square on BG is greater than the square on GC
by the square on H;
therefore the square on GB is greater than the square on GC
by the square on a straight line incommensurable in length
with GB.
And the annex CG is commensurable in length with the
rational straight line A set out;
therefore BC is a fifth apotome.

[x. Deff. ra. 5 ]

Therefore the fifth apotome BC has been found.
Q. E. D.

Let p, kp and the numbers m, n of the last proposition be taken.
Take x such that

n : (m + n) = ky:

In this case * > kp, and

x = kp.

x'

= kpj 1 + A, say.
Then shall (x - kp), or (hp J 1 + A — kp), be afifthapotome.
For, by ( 1 ) , x is rational and « - kp.

And since, by (1), (m + ») -.m-x*:

(x — k*p*),

*/x*- k*if is incommensurable with x.
Also kp « p.

As explained in the note on x . 52, thefifthapotome

ipsj 1 + A - £p
is the lesser root of the quadratic

x* - ikpj 1 + A. * + A#p* = o.
