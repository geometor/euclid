To find the sixth apotome.
Let a rational straight line A be set out, and three
numbers E, BC, CD not having
to one another the ratio which
a square number has to a square

number;
and further let CB also not have
to BD the ratio which a square
number has to a square number.

Let it be contrived that, as
E is to BC, so is the square on A to the square on FG,
and, as BC is to CD, so is the square on FG to the square
on GH.

Now since, as E is to BC, so is the square on A to the
square on FG,
therefore the square on A is commensurable with the square
on FG.
[x. 6 ]
But the square on A is rational ;
therefore the square on FG is also rational;
therefore FG is also rational.
And, since £ has not to BC the ratio which a square
number has to a square number,
therefore neither has the square on A to the square on FG
the ratio which a square number has to a square number;
therefore A is incommensurable in length with FG.
[x. 9]
Again, since, as BC is to CD, so is the square on FG to
the square on GH,
therefore the square on FG is commensurable with the square
on GH.

But the square on FG is rational;
therefore the square on GH is also rational;
therefore GH is also rational.
And, since BC has not to CD the ratio which a square
number has to a square number,
