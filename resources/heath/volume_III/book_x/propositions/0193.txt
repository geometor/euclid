therefore neither has the square on FG to the square on GH
the ratio which a square number has to a square number;
therefore FG is incommensurable in length with GH.
[x. 9 ]
And both are rational;
therefore FG, GH are rational straight lines commensurable
in square only;
therefore FH is an apotome.
[x. 73]
I say next that it is also a sixth apotome.
F o r since, as E is to BC, so is the square on A to the
square on FG,
and, as BC is to CD, so is the square on FG to the square
on GH,
therefore, ex aequali, as E is to CD, so is the square on A to
the square on GH.
[V. 22]
But E has not to CD the ratio which a square number
has to a square number;
therefore neither has the square on A to the square on GH
the ratio which a square number has to a square number;
therefore A is incommensurable in length with GH;
[x. 9 ]
therefore neither of the straight lines FG, GH is commen­
surable in length with the rational straight line A.
Now let the square on A" be that by which the square on
FG is greater than the square on GH.
Since then, as BC is to CD, so is the square on FG to
the square on GH,
therefore, convertendo, as CB is to BD, so is the square on
FG to the square on K.
[v. 19, Por.]
But CB has not to BD the ratio which a square number
has to a square number;
therefore neither has the square on FG to the square on K
the ratio which a square number has to a square number;
therefore FG is incommensurable in length with K.
[x. 9 ]
And the square on FG is greater than the square on GH
by the square on K;
therefore the square on FG is greater than the square on GH
by the square on a straight line incommensurable in length
with FG.
