And neither of the straight lines FG, GH is commen­
surable with the rational straight line A set out.
Therefore FH is a sixth apotome.
[x. Deff. m. 6 ]
Therefore the sixth apotome FH has been found.

Let ft be the given rational straight line.
Take numbers / , (m + n), n which have not to one another the ratio of a
square number to a square number, m, n being also chosen such that the
ratio (m + n) :m is not that of square to square.
Take x, y such that

/ : ( » » + « ) = p': a*
(m + n) : n = x :y*
Then shall (x -y) be a sixth apotome.
For, by ( 1 ) , x is rational and « p
By ( 2 ) , since x is rational,
y is rational and w x
Thus [ ( 3 ) , (4)] (x -y) is an apotome.
Again, ex aequali,
p : n = p* : y,
whence y ^ p.

Thu,s x, y are both « p.
Lastly, convertendo from (2),

whence Jx*-y* _ x.
Therefore (x -y) is a sixth apotome.
From ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) we have

As explained in the note on x. 53, the sixth apotome is the lesser root of
the equation

PROPOSITION 

9 1 .

If an area be contained by a rational straight line and a
first apotome, the "side" of the area is an apotome.
F o r let the area AB be contained by the rational straight
line AC and the first apotome AD ;
I say that the "side" o f the area AB is an apotome.
