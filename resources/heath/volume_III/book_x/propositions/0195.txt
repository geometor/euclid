For, since AD is a first apotome, let DG be its annex ;
therefore AG, GD are rational straight lines commensurable
in square only.
fx. 73]
And the whole AG is commensurable with the rational
straight line AC set out,
and the square on AG is greater than the square on GD
by the square on a straight line commensurable in length
with AG;
[x. Deff. m. 1]
if therefore there be applied to A G a parallelogram equal to
the fourth part of the square on DG and deficient by a square
figure, it divides it into commensurable parts.

Let DG be bisected at E,
let there be applied to AG a parallelogram equal to the square
on EG and deficient by a square figure,
and let it be the rectangle AE, FG;
therefore AF is commensurable with FG.
And through the points E, F, G let EH, FI^ GKbe drawn
parallel to A C.
Now, since AF is commensurable in length with FG,
therefore AG is also commensurable in length with each of
the straight lines AF, FG.
fx. 15]
But AG is commensurable with AC;
therefore each of the straight lines AF, FG is commensurable
in length with AC.
