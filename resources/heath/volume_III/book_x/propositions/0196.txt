And AC is rational;
therefore each o f the straight lines AF, FG is also rational,
so that each of the rectangles AI, FK is also rational, [x. 19]
Now, since DE is commensurable in length with EG,
therefore DG is also commensurable in length with each of
the straight lines DE, EG.
[x. 15]
But DG is rational and incommensurable in length
with AC;
therefore each of the straight lines DE, EG is also rational
and incommensurable in length with AC;
[x. 13]
therefore each of the rectangles DH, EK is medial.
[x. 21]
Now let the square LM be made equal to AI, and let
there be subtracted the square NO having a common angle
with it, the angle LPM, and equal to FK;
therefore the squares LM, NO are about the same diameter.
[vi. 26]
Let PR be their diameter, and let the figure be drawn.
Since then the rectangle contained by AF, FG is equal to
the square on EG,
therefore, as AF is to EG, so is EG to FG.
[vi. 17]
But, as AF is to EG, so is AI to EK,
and, as EG is to FG, so is EK to KF;
[vi. 1]
therefore EK is a mean proportional between A I, KF. [v. u ]
But MN is also a mean proportional between LM, NO,
as was before proved,
[Lemma after x . 53]
and AI is equal to the square LM, and KF to NO ;
therefore MN is also equal to

EK.

But EK is equal to DH, and MN to LO ;
therefore DK is equal to the gnomon UVWaxiA
But AK

is also equal to the squares LM,

therefore the remainder AB is equal to
But ST is the square on

LN;

therefore the square on LN is equal to
therefore LN

ST.

is the "side" of AB.
