I say next that LN is an apotome.
For, since each of the rectangles AI, FK is rational,
and they are equal to LM, NO,
therefore each of the squares LM, NO, that is, the squares on
LP, PN respectively, is also rational;
therefore each of the straight lines LP, PN is also rational.
Again, since DH is medial and is equal to LO,
therefore LO is also medial.
Since then LO is medial,
while NO is rational,
therefore LO is incommensurable with NO.
But, as LO is to NO, so is LP to PN;
[vi. 1]
therefore LP is incommensurable in length with PN. [x. n ]
And both are rational;
therefore LP, PN are rational straight lines commensurable
in square only;
therefore LN is an apotome.
[x. 73]
And it is the "side" of the area AB;
therefore the "side" o f the area AB is an apotome.
Therefore etc.

Q. E. D.

This proposition corresponds to x . 54, and the problem solved in it is to
find and to classify the side of a square equal to the rectangle contained by a
first apotome and p, or (algebraically) to find
2

Jp(kp - kp J1 - X ) .
First find u, v from the equations
u + v = kp
I
uv = ±k*p>(1 - \*) )
If u, v represent the values so found, put

v

''

(2)

and (x -y) shall be the square root required.
T o prove this Euclid argues thus.

By (1),
whence

1

u:\kp <Jl-\* =\kp sIT- X : v,
pu : |j8p* vT^X = ikp* y/i-X* : pv,
x> : \kp* s/T-J? = \kp* V i - X : Jf.

But [Lemma after x. 5 3 ]

x : xy = xy : y',
so that

xy = %kp- Ji - A
