Thus ( x -y) is equal to J p(kpkp J1 — X ).
It has next to be proved that (x-y)
is an apotome.
F r o m ( 1 ) it follows, by x . 17, that
u <-> v;

thus u, v are both commensurable with (u + v) and therefore with p

(4).

Hence u, v are both rational,
so that pu, pv are rational areas;
2

2

therefore, by ( 2 ) , x , y

are rational and commensurable

(5),

whence also * , y are rational straight lines

Next, kp Vi - A. is rational and ^ 0 ;

therefore \kp V ' I —X is a medial area.
That is, by (3), xy is a medial area.

But [(5)] y is a rational area;

therefore

xy ^ _y ,

or

x ^ y.
But [(6)] x , j are both rational.
Therefore x, y are rational and « - ;

so that ( x - _ y ) is an apotome.
T o find the form of ( x - j ) algebraically, we have, by solving ( 1 ) ,

If an area be contained by a rational straight line and a
second apotome, the "side" of the area is a first apotome of a
medial straight line.
F o r let the area AB be contained by the rational straight
line AC and the second apotome AD ;
