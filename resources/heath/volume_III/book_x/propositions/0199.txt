For let DG be the annex to AD ;
therefore AG, GD are rational straight lines commensurable
in square only,
[x. 73]
and the annex DG is commensurable with the rational straight
line AC set out,
while the square on the whole AG is greater than the square
on the annex GD by the square on a straight line commen­
surable in length with AG.
[x. Deff. in. 2]
Since then the square on A G is greater than the square
on GD by the square on a straight line commensurable
with AG,
therefore, if there be applied to AG a parallelogram equal to
the fourth part of the square on GD and deficient by a square
figure, it divides it into commensurable parts.
[x. 17]
Let then DG be bisected at E,
let there be applied to A G a parallelogram equal to the square
on EG and deficient by a square figure,
and let it be the rectangle AF, FG;
therefore AF is commensurable in length with FG.
Therefore AG is also commensurable in length with each
of the straight lines AF, FG.
[x. 15]
But AG is rational and incommensurable in length
with AC;
