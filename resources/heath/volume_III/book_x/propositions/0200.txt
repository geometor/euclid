therefore each of the straight lines AF, FG is also rational
and incommensurable in length with AC;
[x. 13]
therefore each of the rectangles A J, FK is medial.
[x. 21]
Again, since DE is commensurable with EG,
therefore DG is also commensurable with each of the straight
lines DE, EG.
[x. 15]
But DG is commensurable in length with AC.
Therefore each of the rectangles DH, EK is rational.
[x. 19]
Let then the square LMbe
constructed equal to AI,
and let there be subtracted NO equal to FK and being about
the same angle with LM, namely the angle LPM;
therefore the squares LM, NO are about the same diameter.
[vi. 26]
Let PR be their diameter, and let the figure be drawn.
Since then AI, FK are medial and are equal to the squares
on LP, PN,
the squares on LP, PN are also medial;
therefore LP, PN are also medial straight lines commen­
surable in square only.
And, since the rectangle AF, FG is equal to the square
on EG,
therefore, as AF is to EG, so is EG to FG,
[vi. 17]
while, as AF is to EG, so is AI to EK,
and, as EG is to FG, so is EK to FK;
[vi. 1]
therefore EK is a mean proportional between A I, FK. [v. n ]
But MN is also a mean proportional between the squares
LM, NO,
and AI is equal to LM, and FK to NO ;
therefore MN is also equal to EK.
But DH is equal to EK, and LO equal to MN;
therefore the whole DK is equal to the gnomon
UVW
and NO.
Since then the whole AK is equal to LM, NO,
and, in these, DK is equal to the gnomon UVW and NO,
therefore the remainder AB is equal to TS.
