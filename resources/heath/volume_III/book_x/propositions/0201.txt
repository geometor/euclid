AB;

I say that LN is a first apotome of a medial straight line.
For, since EK is rational and is equal to LO,
therefore LO, that is, the rectangle LP, PN, is rational.
But N0 was proved medial;
therefore LO is incommensurable with NO.
But, as LO is to NO, so is LP to PN;
[vi. 1]
therefore LP, PN are incommensurable in length.
[x. n ]
Therefore LP, PN are medial straight lines commen­
surable in square only which contain a rational rectangle;
therefore LN is a first apotome of a medial straight line.
[x. 74]

And it is the "side" of the area AB.
Therefore the "side" of the area AB
of a medial straight line.

There is an evident flaw in the text in the place (Heiberg, p. 282,
1 1 . 1 7 — 2 0 : translation p . 196 above) where it is said that "since then A I, FK
are medial and are equal to the squares on LP, PN, the squares on LP, PN
are also medial; therefore L P , PN are also medial straight lines commensurable
in square only." It is not till the last lines of the proposition (Heiberg, p. 284,
11. 17, 18) that it is proved that LP, PN are incommensurable in length. What
should have been proved in the former passage is that the squares on LP, PN
are commensurable, so that LP, PN are commensurable in square (not
commensurable in square only). I have supplied the step in the note below :
" A l s o x ^y , since u « v." Theon seems to have observed the omission and
to have put " a n d commensurable with one another" after " m e d i a l " in the
passage quoted, though even this does not show why the squares on LP, PN
are commensurable. One MS. ( V ) also has " o n l y "
erased after
"commensurable in square."
