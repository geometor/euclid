is proved in the same way as is the corresponding fact in x. 9 1 .
From (1)

u:\kp = \kp:v,

so that

pu :\kp

But

whence, by ( 2 ) ,

xy = \kp

(x -yf

Next, we have to prove that (x —y) is a first apotome of a medial straight
line.
From (1) it follows, by x . 17, that
u f> v

U)>

therefore u, v are both « (u + v).
But [(1)] ( « + v) is rational and ^ p;
therefore u, v are both rational and
p
(5).
Therefore pu, pv, or x , y\ are both medial areas, and x, y are medial
straight lines

Also x <~~ y , since u « v [(4)]

Now xy, or | £ p , is a rational a r e a ;
therefore

Hence [(6), (7), (3)] x, y are medial straight lines commensurable in square
only and containing a rational rectangle;
therefore (x —y) is a first apotome of a medial straight line.
