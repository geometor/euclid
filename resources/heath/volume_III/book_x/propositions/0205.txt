But, as AF is to EG, so is AI to EK,
and, as EG is to EG, so is EK to FK;
[vi. i ]
therefore also, as AI is to EK, so is EK to /TA';
[v. u ]
therefore EK is a mean proportional between A I, FK.
But MN is also a mean proportional between the squares
LM,
NO,
and AI is equal to Z M , and
to 7V<9 ;
therefore EK is also equal to MN.
But J / i V is equal to LO, and EK equal to Z ? / f ;
therefore the whole DK is also equal to the gnomon
UVW
and iVO.
But
is also equal to LM,
NO;
therefore the remainder AB is equal to 5 Z , that is, to the
square on
LN;
therefore LN is the "side" of the area AB.

I say that LN is a second apotome of a medial straight
line.
For,since AI,FKwere
proved medial, and are equal to the
squares on LP,
PN,
therefore each of the squares on LP, PN

is also medial;

therefore each of the straight lines LP, PN is medial.
And, since AI is commensurable with FK,
[vi. i , x. n ]
therefore the square on LP is also commensurable with the
square on PN.
Again, since AI was proved incommensurable with EK,
therefore LM is also incommensurable with MN,
that is, the square on LP with the rectangle LP,
PN;
so that LP is also incommensurable in length with PN;
[vi. I , x. 1 1 ]
therefore LP, PN are medial straight lines commensurable in
square only.
I say next that they also contain a medial rectangle.
For, since EK was proved medial, and is equal to the
rectangle LP,
PN,
therefore the rectangle LP, PN is also medial,
so that LP, PN are medial straight lines commensurable in
square only which contain a medial rectangle.
