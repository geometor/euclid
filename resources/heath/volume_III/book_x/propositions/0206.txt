Therefore the "side" of the area AB

is a second apotome
Q. E. D.


Here we are to find and classify the irrational straight line
Jp(Jk.p-Jk.pjT-\*).
Following the same method, we put
u + v=Jk.p
K»

Next, u, v being found, let
#'*»'-\

( 2 )

.

then (x-y) is the square root required and is a second apotome of a medial
straight line.
That (x —y) is the square root required and that x", y" are medial areas, so
that x, y are medial straight lines, is proved exactly as in the last proposition.
T h e rectangle xy, being equal to J Jk .f? Jl - X*, is also medial.
Now, from (1), by x . 1 7 ,
whence
But

u <•> v,
u + v o u.

(u + v), or Jk. p, v J Jk . p JT^- X?;

therefore

u ^ J Jk. p Ji—X',

and consequently

or

x <_. xy,

whence
x ^ y.
And, since u « v,
pu <"> pv,
or
x* « y
Thus x, y are medial straight lines commensurable in square only.
A n d xy is a medial area.
Therefore (x—y) is a second apotome of a medial straight line.
Its actual form is found by solving equations (1), ( 2 ) ;
thus
u = I (Jk. p + \ Jk. p),
v=
l(Jk.p-\Jk.p),

As explained in the note on x . 56, this is the lesser positive root of the
