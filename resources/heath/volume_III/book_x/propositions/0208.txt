is rational and commensurable in length

therefore the whole AK is rational.
[x. 19]
Again, since DG is incommensurable in length with AC,
and both are rational,
therefore DK is medial.
[x. 21]
Again, since AEis
incommensurable in length with EG,
therefore AI is also incommensurable with EK.
[vt 1, x. n]
Now let the square LM be constructed equal to AI,
and let there be subtracted NO equal to FK and about the
same angle, the angle LPM.
Therefore the squares LM, NO are about the same
diameter.
[vi. 26]
Let PR be their diameter, and let the figure be drawn.

Since then the rectangle AF,
EG,

therefore, proportionally, as AF

so is EG to EG.
[vi. 1 7 ]

But, as AF is to EG, so is AI to EK,
and, as EG is to EG, so is EK to FK;
[vi. 1]
therefore EK is a mean proportional between A I, FK. [v. » ]
But MN is also a mean proportional between the squares
LM,
NO,
and AI is equal to LM, and FK to NO;
therefore EK is also equal to MN.
But DH is equal to EK, and Z 0 is equal to MN;
therefore the whole DK is equal to the gnomon
