Q. E. D.


E. D.

We have here to find a"nd classify the straight line

A s usual, we find u, v from the equations
u + v = kp
\
, ky I
* 1 + AJ
and then, giving u, v their values, we put

(i),

(2).

\

w

y = pv )
Then (x -y) is the required square root.
This is proved in the same way as before, and, as before, it is proved that
V I -l-A

Now, from ( 1 ) , by x . 18,

u ^ v;

therefore

pu ^> pv,

or

x* ysy>,

so that x, y are incommensurable in square.

A n d x +y, or p (« + v), is a rational area (kp ).
V
But 2xy = 1

, which is a medial area.

Hence [x. 76] (x -y) is the irrational straight line called minor.
