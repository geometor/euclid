on the annex DG by the square on a straight line incommen­
surable with A G.
[x. Deff. m. 5]
Therefore, if there be applied to AG a parallelogram
equal to the fourth part of the square on DG and deficient
by a square figure, it will divide it into incommensurable
[x. 18]
parts.
Let then DG be bisected at the point E,
let there be applied to AG a parallelogram equal to the
square on EG and deficient by a square figure, and let it be
the rectangle AF, EG ;
therefore AF

is incommensurable in length with EG.

Now, since AG is incommensurable in length with
and both are rational,
therefore AK

is medial.

CA,

[x. 21]

Again, since DG is rational and commensurable in length
with A C,
DK

is rational.

[x. 19]
Now let the square LM be constructed equal to AI, and
let the square NO equal to FK and about the same angle, the
angle LPM, be subtracted ;
therefore the squares LM,

NO

are about the same diameter.
[vi. 26]

Let PR be their diameter, and let the figure be drawn.
Similarly then we can prove that LN is the "side" of the
area AB.
I say that LN is the straight line which produces with a
rational area a medial whole.
For, since AK was proved medial and is equal to the
squares on LP,
PN,
therefore the sum of the squares on LP,

PN

is medial.

Again, since DK is rational and is equal to twice the
rectangle LP,
PN,
the latter is itself also rational.
And, since AI is incommensurable with FK,
therefore the square on LP is also incommensurable with the
square on PN;
therefore LP,

PN

are straight lines incommensurable in
