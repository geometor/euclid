square which make the sum of the squares on them medial
but twice the rectangle contained by them rational.
Therefore the remainder LN is the irrational straight line
called that which produces with a rational area a medial
whole;
[x. 77]
and it is the " side " of the area

AB.

Therefore the "side" of the area AB is a straight line
which produces with a rational area a medial whole.
Q. E. D.


Here the problem is to find and classify
Jp(kp J1 + X - kp).
A s usual, we put
U + V = kpJl+\\

. v

and, u, v being found, we take
2

}

x = pu
f = pv
T h e n (x-y) so found is our required square root.
This fact is proved as before, and, as before, we see that

to

xy = \ V u ~ v,
pu ^ pv,
x? ^ y,

Now from ( 1 ) , by x . »8,
whence
or

and x, y are incommensurable in square.

Next (x +y')=p(u + v) = kp Ji + K, which is a medial area.
A n d 2xy = kp , which is a rational area.
Hence (x-y) is the "side" of a medial, minus a rational, area.
Algebraical solution gives
1

[x. 77]

* = ^(VTTx-Vx),
and therefore
p y/*(Ji+K+

VX)-p

*/*(Ji+X-JX),

which is, as explained in the note to x. 58, the lesser positive root of the
equation

x* - 2k? V r + x .

+ X / t y = o.
