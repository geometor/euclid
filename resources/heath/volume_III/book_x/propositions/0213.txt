For let the area AB be contained by the rational straight
line AC and the sixth apotome AD ;
I say that the "side" of the area AB is a straight line which
produces with a medial area a medial whole.

For let DG be the annex to

AD;

therefore AG, GD are rational straight lines commensurable
in square only,
neither of them is commensurable in length with the rational
straight line A C set out,
and the square on the whole AG is greater than the square
on the annex DG by the square on a straight line incommen­
surable in length with A G.
[x. Deff. ni. 6]
Since then the square on A G is greater than the square
on GD by the square on a straight line incommensurable in
length with A G,
therefore, if there be applied to AG a parallelogram equal to
the fourth part of the square on DG and deficient by a square
figure, it will divide it into incommensurable parts.
[x. 18;
Let then DG be bisected at E,
let there be applied to AG

a parallelogram equal to the square
