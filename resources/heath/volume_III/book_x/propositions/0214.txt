on EG and deficient by a square figure, and let it be the
rectangle AF,
EG;
therefore AF is incommensurable in length with EG.
But, as AF

is to EG, so is AI

to FK;

[vi .1]

therefore AI is incommensurable with FK.
[x. u ]
And, since AG, AC are rational straight lines commensur­
able in square only,
AK is medial.
[x. 21]
Again, since AC, DG are rational straight lines and
incommensurable in length,
DK is also medial.
[x. 21]
Now, since AG, GD are commensurable in square only,
therefore A G is incommensurable in length with GD.
But, as A G is to GD, so is AK to KD ;
[vi. 1]
therefore AK is incommensurable with KD.
[x. n ]
Now let the square LM be constructed equal to AI,
and let NO equal to FK, and about the same angle, be
subtracted ;
therefore the squares LM, NO are about the same diameter.
[vi. 26]

Let PR be their diameter, and let the figure be drawn.
Then in manner similar to the above we can prove that
LN is the " side " of the area AB.
I say that LN is a straight line which produces with a
medial area a medial whole.
For, since AK
was proved medial and is equal to the
squares on LP,
PN,
therefore the sum of the squares on LP, PN is medial.
Again, since DK was proved medial and is equal to twice
the rectangle LP,
PN,
twice the rectangle LP, PN is also medial.
And, since AK was proved incommensurable with DK,
the squares on LP, PN are also incommensurable with twice
the rectangle LP,
PN.
And, since AI is incommensurable with FK,
therefore the square on LP is also incommensurable with the
square on PN;
