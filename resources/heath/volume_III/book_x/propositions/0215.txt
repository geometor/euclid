therefore LP, PN
are straight lines incommensurable in
square which make the sum of the squares on them medial,
twice the rectangle contained by them medial, and further the
squares on them incommensurable with twice the rectangle
contained by them.
Therefore LN is the irrational straight line called that
which produces with a medial area a medial whole; [x. 78]
and it is the " side " of the area

AB.

Therefore the "side" of the area is a straight line which
produces with a medial area a medial whole.
Q. E. D.


We have to find and classify
Jp(Jk.p-J%

Put, as usual,

(2).

and, u, v being thus found, let

Then, as before, (x-y)

is the square root required.

For, from (1), by x . 18,
u ^ v,
whence
pu ^ pv,
or
x v y,
and x, y are incommensurable in square.
Next, x* +y = p (u +• v) = Jk. p\ which is a medial area.
Also 2xy = JK. p , which is again a medial area.
Lastly, Jk. p, JK. p are by hypothesis
so that
Jk. p
JK. p,
whence
Jk. p' w JK. p*
or
(x* +yr) u 2xy.
Thus (x-y) is the "side" of a medial, minus a medial, area [x. 78].
Algebraical solution gives

u=

^(JA-+Jk^K),

v^(Jk-JJ^K),
whence
x-y = p-J?(Jk + Jk-K) -pJ%(JkJk-K).
This, as explained in the note on x . 59, is the lesser positive root of the
equation
x*-2jk.p'x*
+ (k-X)p = o.
