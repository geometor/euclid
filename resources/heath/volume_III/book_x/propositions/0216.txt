The square on an apotome applied to a rational
line -produces as breadth a first apotome.

straight

Let AB be an apotome, and CD rational,
and to CD let there be applied CE equal to the square on
AB and producing CE as breadth ;
I say that CE is a first apotome.

For let BG be the annex to AB ;
therefore AG, GB are rational straight lines commensurable
in square only.
[x. 73]
T o CD let there be applied CH equal to the square on
and KL equal to the square on BG.
Therefore the whole CL is equal to the squares on A G, GB,
and, in these, CE is equal to the square on AB;
therefore the remainder EL is equal to twice the rectangle
AG, GB.

AG,

Let EM be bisected at the point N,
and let NO be drawn through N parallel to CD;
therefore each of the rectangles EO, LN
is equal to the
rectangle AG,
GB.
Now, since the squares on AG, GB are rational,
and DM is equal to the squares on AG,
GB,.
therefore DM is rational.
And it has been applied to the rational straight line CD,
producing CM as breadth ;
therefore CM is rational and commensurable in length with
CD.
[X. 2<k]
Again, since twice the rectangle AG, GB is medial, and
EL is equal to twice the rectangle A G, GB,
therefore EL is medial.
