FM

And it is applied to the rational straight line CD, producing
as breadth;

therefore FM
CD.

is rational and incommensurable in length with
[x. 22]

And, since the squares on AG, GB are rational,
while twice the rectangle AG, GB is medial,
therefore the squares on A G, GB are incommensurable with
twice the rectangle A G, GB.
And CL is equal to the squares on A G,
and FL to twice the rectangle A G,
therefore DM

GB;

is incommensurable with

But, as DM

GB,

FL.

is to FL, so is CM to FM;

therefore CM is incommensurable in length with FM.

[vi. 1 ]

[x. n ]

And both are rational;
therefore CM, MF
in square only;

are rational straight lines commensurable

therefore CF is an apotome.

[x. 73]

I say next that it is also a first apotome.
For, since the rectangle AG, GB is a mean proportional
between the squares on AG,
GB,
and CH is equal to the square on
KL

equal to the square on

and NL

AG,

BG,

equal to the rectangle AG,

therefore NL

GB,

is also a mean proportional between CH, KL ;

therefore, as CH is to NL,

so is NL

But, as CH is to NL,

so is CK to

and, as NL

is to KL, so is NM

to

to

KL.
NM,

KM;

[vi- 1]

therefore the rectangle CK, KM is equal to the square on
NM [vi. 17], that is, to the fourth part of the square on FM.
And, since the square ox\ AG
square on GB,

is commensurable with the

CH

KL.

is also commensurable with
But, as CH is to KL,

so is CK to KM;

therefore CK is commensurable with

KM.

Since then CM, MF are two unequal straight lines,
