and to CM there has been applied the rectangle CK, KM
equal to the fourth part of the square on FM and deficient by
a square figure,
while CK is commensurable with

KM,

therefore the square on CM is greater than the square on MF
by the square on a straight line commensurable in length
with CM.
[x. 17]
And CM is commensurable in length with the rational
straight line CD set out;
therefore CF is a first apotome.

Q. E. D.


Here begins the hexad of propositions solving the problems which are the
converse of those in the hexad just concluded. Props. 97 to 102 correspond
of course to Props. 60 to 65 relating to the binomials etc.
We have in x. 97 to prove that, (p — Jk. p) being an apotome,
(P~jk.p?
f
is a first apotome, and we have to find it geometrically.
Euclid's procedure may be represented thus.

and we have to prove that (x+y) — 2Z is afirstapotome.
(o) Now p ' + kp', or a(x +y), is rational;
therefore (x +y) is rational and * a
A n d 2 Jk. p', or a. 2z, is medial:
therefore 2% is rational and <-> a
But, a (x +y) being rational, and a . 22 medial,
a(x +y) v a . 2Z,
whence
( +J>) w 2z.
Therefore, since (x +y), 2Z are both rational [(2), (3)],
(x +y), 2z are rational and
Hence (x +y) - 2z is an apotome.
(/3) Since Jk. p' is a mean proportional between p", kp',
az is a mean proportional between ax, ay [by (1)].
That is,
ax : az = az : ay,
or
x : z = z : y,
