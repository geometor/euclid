The square on a first apotome of a medial straight
line
applied to a rational straight line produces as breadth a second
apotome.
Let AB be a first apotome of a medial straight line and
CD a rational straight line,
and to CD let there be applied CE equal to the square on
AB, producing C F a s breadth ;
I say that CE is a second apotome.
For let BG be the annex to AB;.
therefore AG, GB are medial straight lines commensurable in
square only which contain a rational rectangle.

T o CD let there be applied CH equal to the square on
AG, producing CK as breadth, and KL equal to the square
on GB, producing KM as breadth ;
therefore the whole CL is equal to the squares on A G, GB ;
therefore CL is also medial.
[x. 15 and 23, Por.]
And it is applied to the rational straight line CD, pro­
ducing CM as breadth;
therefore CM is rational and incommensurable in length with
[x. 22]
CD.
