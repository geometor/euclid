Now, since CL is equal to the squares on AG, GB,
and, in these, the square on AB is equal to CE,
therefore the remainder, twice the rectangle A G, GB, is equal
to FL.
[»• 7]
But twice the rectangle A G, GB is rational;
therefore EL is rational.
And it is applied to the rational straight line EE, producing
FM as breadth ;
therefore FM is also rational and commensurable in length
with CD.
[x. 20]
Now, since the sum of the squares on AG, GB, that is,
CL, is medial, while twice the rectangle AG, GB, that is, FL,
is rational,
therefore CL is incommensurable with FL.
But, as CL is to FL, so is CM to FM;
therefore CM is incommensurable in length with FM.

[vi. 1]
[x. n]

And both are rational;
therefore CM, MF are rational straight lines commensurable
in square only;
therefore CE is an apotome.
[x. 73]
I say next that it is also a second apotome.
For let FM be bisected at N,
and let NO be drawn through N parallel to CD;
therefore each of the rectangles FO, NL
is equal to the
rectangle A G, GB.
Now, since the rectangle AG, GB is a mean proportional
between the squares on AG,
GB,
and the square on AG is equal to CH,
the rectangle A G, GB to NL,
and the square on BG to KL,
therefore NL is also a mean proportional between CH, KL;
therefore, as CH is to NL, so is NL to KL.
But, as CH is to NL, so is CK to NM,
and, as NL is to KL, so is NM to MK;
K 1]
[v. » ]
therefore, as CK is to NM, so is NM to KM;
therefore the rectangle CK, KM is equal to the square on
NM [vi. 17], that is, to the fourth part of the square on FM.
