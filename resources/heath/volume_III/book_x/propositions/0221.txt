Since then CM, MF are two unequal straight lines, and
the rectangle CK, KM equal to the fourth part of the square
on MF and deficient by a square figure has been applied to
the greater, CM, and divides it into commensurable parts,
therefore the square on CM is greater than the square on MF
by the square on a straight line commensurable in length with
CM.

[x. 1 7 ]
And the annex FM is commensurable in length with the
rational straight line CD set out;
therefore CF is a second apotome.

In this case we have to find and classify

therefore a (x +y) is medial,
whence (x+y) is rational and ^ a

But 2kp*, and therefore a. 22, is rational,
whence 22 is rational and a

And, a (x+y) being medial, and a. 22 rational,
a (x +y) ^ a . 22,
or
(x +y) ^ 22.
Hence (x+y), 22 are rational straight lines commensurable in square only,
and therefore (x+y)-2s
is an apotome.

Therefore [(4), (5)], by x. 17,

And 22 « <r.
Therefore (x +y) - 22 is a second apotome.
Obviously

(x +y) - 22 = — {Jk (1 + k) - 2k}.
