The square on a second apotome of a medial straight
applied to a rational straight line produces as breadth a
apotome.

line

Let AB be a second apotome of a medial straight line,
and CD rational,
and to CD let there be applied CE equal to the square on
AB, producing CE as breadth ;
I say that CE is a third apotome.

For let BG be the annex to AB;
therefore AG, GB are medial straight lines commensurable
in square only which contain a medial rectangle.
[x. 75]
Let CH equal to the square on AG be applied to CD,
producing CK as breadth,
and let KL equal to the square on BG be applied to KH,
producing KM as breadth ;
therefore the whole CL is equal to the squares on AG,
GB;
therefore CL is also medial.
[x. 15 and 23, Por.]
And it is applied to the rational straight line CD, producing
CM as breadth ;
therefore CM is rational and incommensurable in length with
CD.
[x. 22]
Now, since the whole CL is equal to the squares on AG,
GB, and, in these, CE is equal to the square on AB,
therefore the remainder LF is equal to twice the rectangle
AG,

GB.

Let then FM be bisected at the point A ,
and let NO be drawn parallel to CD;
therefore each of the rectangles FO, NL is equal to the rect­
angle AG,
GB.
