But the rectangle AG, GB is medial;
therefore FL is also medial.
And it is applied to the rational straight line EF, producing
FM as breadth ;
therefore FM is also rational and incommensurable in length
with CD.
[x. 22]
And, since AG, GB are commensurable in square only,
therefore A G is incommensurable in length with GB;
therefore the square on A G is also incommensurable with the
rectangle AG, GB.
[vi. 1, x. n ]
But the squares on AG, GB are commensurable with the
square on AG,
and twice the rectangle AG, GB with the rectangle AG, GB;
therefore the squares on AG, GB are incommensurable with
twice the rectangle AG, GB.
[x. 13]
But CL is equal to the squares on A G, GB,
and FL is equal to twice the rectangle A G,

GB;

therefore CL is also incommensurable with

FL.

But, as CL is to FL,

so is CM to FM;

[vi. 1]

therefore CM is incommensurable in length with FM.

[x. 1 1 ]

And both are rational;
therefore CM, MF are rational straight lines commensurable
in square only;
therefore CF is an apotome.

|x. 73]

I say next that it is also a third apotome.
For, since the square on AG is commensurable with the
square on GB,
therefore CH is also commensurable with KL,
so that CK is also commensurable with KM.
[vi. 1, x. n ]
And, since the rectangle AG, GB is a mean proportional
between the squares on A G, GB,
and CH is equal to the square on
KL

AG,

equal to the square on GB,

and NL

equal to the rectangle A G,

therefore NL

GB,

is also a mean proportional between CH, KL ;

therefore, as CH is to NL,

so is NL

to

KL.
