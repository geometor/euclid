But, as CH is to NL, so is CK to NM,
and, as NL is to KL, so is NM to KM;

[vi. i ]

therefore, as CK is to MN,

[v. i i ]

so is MN

to j O / ;

therefore the rectangle CK, KM is equal to [the square on
MN,
that is, to] the fourth part of the square on FM.
Since then CM, MF are two unequal straight lines, and
a parallelogram equal to the fourth part of the square on FM
and deficient by a square figure has been applied to CM, and
divides it into commensurable parts,
therefore the square on CM is greater than the square on
MF
by the square on a straight line commensurable with
CM.
[x. 17]
And neither of the straight lines CM, MF is commensur­
able in length with the rational straight line CD set out;
therefore CF is a third apotome.
[x. Deff. in. 3]
Therefore etc.
