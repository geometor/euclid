Thus [(1), (2), (3)] (x +y), 2z are rational and
so that (x+y) - 2z is an apotome.

Therefore (x + y) - 2Z is a Mf'riZ apotome.

The

square on a minor straight line applied to a
line produces as breadth a fourth
apotome.

rational

Let AB be a minor and CD a rational straight line, and
to the rational straight line CD let CE be applied equal to the
square on AB and producing CE as breadth ;
I say that CE is a fourth apotome.

For let BG be the annex to AB;
therefore AG, GB are straight lines incommensurable in
square which make the sum of the squares on AG,

rational, but twice the rectangle AG, GB medial.

T o CD let there be applied CH
and producing CK as breadth,

equal to the square on

and KL equal to the square on BG, producing KM as breadth;
therefore the whole CL is equal to the squares on AG, GB.
And the sum of the squares on A G, GB is rational;
therefore CL is also rational.
And it is applied to the rational straight line CD, producing
CM as breadth;
therefore CM is also rational and commensurable in length
with CD.
