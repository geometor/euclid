And, since twice the rectangle AG,

GB is medial and is

therefore FL

is also medial.

And it is applied to the rational straight line EE, producing
FM as breadth ;
therefore FM is rational and incommensurable in length with

CD.
And, since the sum of the squares on AG, GB is rational,
while twice the rectangle AG, GB is medial,
the squares on AG, GB are incommensurable with twice the
rectangle A G, GB.
But CL is equal to the squares on AG,
and FL

equal to twice the rectangle A G,

GB,
GB;

therefore CL is incommensurable with FL.
But, as CL is to FL, so is CM to MF;
therefore CM is incommensurable in length with MF.

[vi. i ]

[x. n ]

A n d both are rational;
therefore CM, MF are rational straight lines commensurable
in square only;
therefore CF is an apotome.
[x. 73]
I say that it is also a fourth apotome.
For, since AG, GB are incommensurable in square,
therefore the square on A G is also incommensurable with the
square on GB.
And CH is equal to the square on A G,
and KL

equal to the square on

GB;

therefore CH is incommensurable with

KL.
