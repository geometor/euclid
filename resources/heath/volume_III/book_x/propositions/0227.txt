But, as CH is to KL,

so is CK to KM;

[vi. 1]

therefore CK is incommensurable in length with KM.
And, since the rectangle AG,
between the squares on AG,

GB

[x. it]

is a mean proportional

GB,

and the square on A G is equal to CH,
the square on GB to

KL,

and the rectangle A G, GB to
therefore NL

NL,

is a mean proportional between CH, KL ;

therefore, as CH is to NL,

so is NL

to

KL.

7

But, as CH is to A / . , so is CK to A W ,
and, as NL

is to KL,

so is A W to KM;
7

therefore, as CK is to ^ / A , so is MN

[vi. 1]

to A W ;

[v. n ]

therefore the rectangle CK, KM is equal to the square on
MN [vi. I 7], that is, to the fourth part of the square on FM.
Since then CM, MF are two unequal straight lines, and
the rectangle CK, KM equal to the fourth part of the square
on MF and deficient by a square figure has been applied to
CM and divides it into incommensurable parts,
therefore the square on CM is greater than the square on
MF by the square on a straight line incommensurable with
CM.
[x. 18]
And the whole CM is commensurable in length with the
rational straight line CD set out;
therefore CF is a fourth apotome.

[x. Deff. mi. 4]

Therefore etc.
