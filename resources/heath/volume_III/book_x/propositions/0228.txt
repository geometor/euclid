Let AB
be the straight line which produces with a
rational area a medial whole, and CD a rational straight line,
and to CD let CE be applied equal to the square on AB and
producing CE as breadth ;
I say that CE is a fifth apotome.

For let BG be the annex to AB ;
therefore AG, GB are straight lines incommensurable in
square which make the sum of the squares on them medial
but twice the rectangle contained by them rational.

T o CD let there be applied CH equal to the square on
A G, and KL equal to the square on GB;
therefore the whole CL is equal to the squares on AG, GB.
