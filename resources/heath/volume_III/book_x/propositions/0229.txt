together is

therefore CL is medial.
CM

And it is applied to the rational straight line CD, producing
as breadth;

therefore CM is rational and incommensurable with CD. [x. 22]
And, since the whole CL is equal to the squares on AG,
and, in these, CE is equal to the square on

Let then FM be bisected at N,

therefore FL is rational.

Now, since CL is medial, and FL rational,
cherefore CL is incommensurable with

FL,

But, as CL is to FL, so is CM to MF;
therefore CM is incommensurable in length with MF.

[x. it]

And both are rational;
therefore CM, MF are rational straight lines commensurable
in square only;
therefore CF is an apotome.

[x. 73]

I say next that it is also a fifth apotome.
For we can prove similarly that the rectangle CK, KM
is equal to the square on NM, that is, to the fourth part of the
square on FM.
And, since the square on AG is incommensurable with the
square on GB,
