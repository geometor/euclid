while the square on AG

is equal to

CH,

KL,

therefore CH is incommensurable with
But, as CH is to KL,

KL.

so is CK to KM;

[vi. i ]

therefore CK is incommensurable in length with KM.

[x. 11]

Since then CM, MF are two unequal straight lines,
and a parallelogram equal to the fourth part of the square
on FM and deficient by a square figure has been applied to
CM, and divides it into incommensurable parts,
therefore the square on CM is greater than the square on
MF by the square on a straight line incommensurable with
CM.
[x. 18J
And the annex FM is commensurable with the rational
straight line CD set out;
x

therefore CF is a fifth apotome.

Call this - (« - j') , and take x, y, z such that
<rx = u'
<ry = v
a . 22 - 2UV
In this case u . v are incommensurable, (« + v*) is a medial area and 2uv
a rational area.
Since a (x + y) is medial and c . 22 rational,
(x +y) is rational and ~ cr,
22 is rational and " cr,
while
(x+y) ^ 2 2 .
It follows that (x +y), 22 are rational and «•>-,
so that (JC +y) - *z is an apotome.
Again, as before,
xy = z = \ (2Z) ,
and, since « ^ y ,
