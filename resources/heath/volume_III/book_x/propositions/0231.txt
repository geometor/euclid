Let AB be the straight line which produces with a medial
area a medial whole, and CD a rational straight line,
and to CD let CE be applied equal to the square on AB
producing CE as breadth;

I say that CE is a sixth apotome.

For let BG be the annex to AB ;
therefore AG, GB are straight lines incommensurable in
square which make the sum of the squares on them medial,
twice the rectangle AG, GB medial, and the squares on AG,
GB incommensurable with twice the rectangle AG, GB. [x. 78]
Now to CD let there be applied CH equal to the square
on AG and producing CK a.s breadth,
and KL equal to the square on

BG;

therefore the whole CL is equal to the squares on AG,

GB;

therefore CL is also medial.
And it is applied to the rational straight line CD, produc­
ing CM as breadth;
therefore CM
with CD.

is rational and incommensurable in length
[x. 22]

Since now CL is equal to the squares on AG,
GB,
and, in these, CE is equal to the square on AB,
therefore the remainder FL is equal to twice the rectangle
AG, GB.

And twice the rectangle A G, GB is medial;
therefore FL is also medial.
