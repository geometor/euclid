therefore FM

is rational and incommensurable in length
[x. 22]

And, since the squares on AG, GB are incommensurable
with twice the rectangle A G, GB,
and CL is equal to the squares on AG, GB,
and FL equal to twice the rectangle A G, GB,
therefore CL is incommensurable with FL.
But, as CL is to FL, so is CM to MF;
[Vi. 1]
therefore CM is incommensurable in length with MF.
[x. n ]
And both are rational.
Therefore CM, MF are rational straight lines commen­
surable in square only;
therefore CE is an apotome.
[x. 73]
I say next that it is also a sixth apotome.
For, since FL is equal to twice the rectangle AG,
let FM be bisected at N,

GB,

and let NO be drawn through N parallel to CD;
therefore each of the rectangles FO, NL is equal to the rect­
angle AG, GB.
And, since AG,

GB are incommensurable in square,

therefore the square on AG
square on GB.

is incommensurable with the

But CH is equal to the square on A G,
and KL

is equal to the square on

GB;

therefore CH is incommensurable with

KL.

But, as CH is to KL, so is CK to KM;
therefore CK is incommensurable with KM.

And, since the rectangle A G, GB is a mean proportional
between the squares on AG, GB,
and CH is equal to the square on A G,
KL

equal to the square on GB,

and NL

equal to the rectangle AG,

therefore NL

GB,

is also a mean proportional between CH, KL ;

therefore, as CH is to NL,

so is NL

to

KL.
