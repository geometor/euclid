And for the same reason as before the square on CM is
greater than the square on MF by the square on a straight
line incommensurable with CM.
[x. 18]
And neither of them is commensurable with the rational
straight line CD set out;
therefore CF is a sixth apotome.

Here u , v are incommensurable,
(» + v ), 2uv are both medial areas,
and
(u + i?)
2uv.
Since a-(x + y), c r . 2z are medial and incommensurable,
(x +y) is rational and ^ <r,
z is rational and ^ cr,
and
(* +y) ^ 2Z.
Hence (x +y), 2z are rational and
so that (x +y) — 22 is an apotome.
Again, since u , v , or ax, ay, are incommensurable,
x v y.
And, as before,
xy = z = i (22)'.
Therefore [x. 18]

Let AB be an apotome,
and let CD be commensurable
length with AB;

in

I say that CD is also an apotome and
the same in order with AB.
