For, since AB
therefore AE, EB
in square only.

is an apotome, let BE

be the annex to it;

are rational straight lines commensurable
[x. 73]

Let it be contrived that the ratio of BE
as the ratio of AB to CD;

to DF is the same
[vi. 12]

therefore also, as one is to one, so are all to all;
therefore also, as the whole AE
to CD.

[v. 12]

is to the whole CE, so is AB

But AB is commensurable in length with CD.
Therefore AE is also commensurable with CE, and BE
with DF.
[x. 11]
And AE, EB
square only;

are rational straight lines commensurable in

therefore CF, ED are also rational straight lines commensur­
able in square only.
[x. 13]
Now since, as AE

is to CF, so is BE

alternately therefore, as AE

to DF,

is to EB, so is CF to FD.

[v. 16]

And the square on AE is greater than the square on EB
either by the square on a straight line commensurable with
AE
or by the square on a straight line incommensurable
with it.
If then the square on AE is greater than the square on
EB by the square on a straight line commensurable with AE,
the square on CF will also be greater than the square on FD
by the square on a straight line commensurable with CF.
[x. 14]
And, if AE is commensurable in length with the rational
straight line set out,
CF is so also,
if BE,

[x. 12]

then DF also,

and, if neither of the straight lines AE,
the straight lines CF, FD.

[id.]
EB,

then neither of
[x. 13]

But, if the square on AE is greater than the square on EB
by the square on a straight line incommensurable with AE,
the square on CF will also be greater than the square on FD
by the square on a straight line incommensurable with CF.
[x. 14]
