And, if AE is commensurable in length with the rational
straight line set out,
CE is so also,
if BE,

then DF also,

[x. 12]

and, if neither of the straight lines AE, EB, then neither of
the straight lines CF, FD.

Therefore CD is an apotome and the same in order
with AB.
Q. E. D.


This and the following propositions to 107 inclusive (like the correspond­
ing theorems x. 66 to 70) are easy and require no elucidation. T h e y are
equivalent to saying that, if in any of the preceding irrational straight lines
m

p is substituted for p, the resulting irrational is of the same kind and order

as that from which it is altered.

PROPOSITION

A straight
line commensurable
medial straight line is an apotome
and the same in order.

104.

with an apotome of a
of a medial straight
line

Let AB be an apotome of a medial straight line,
and let CD be commensurable in
length with AB;
I say that CD is also an apotome of a
c
p
medial straight line and the same in
order with AB.
A

B

E

F

For, since AB is an apotome of a medial straight line, let
be the annex to it.
Therefore AE, EB are medial straight lines commensur­
able in square only.
[x. 74, 75]
Let it be contrived that, as AB is to CD, so is BE to DF;
EB

[vi. 12]

therefore AE
is also commensurable with CF, and BE
with DF.
[v. 12, x. 1 1 ]
But AE, EB are medial straight lines commensurable in
square only;
therefore CF, FD are also medial straight lines [x. 23] com­
mensurable in square only ;
[x. 13]
therefore CD is an apotome of a medial straight line. [x. 74, 75]
