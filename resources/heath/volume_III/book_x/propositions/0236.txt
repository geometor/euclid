I say next that it is also the same in order with
Since, as AE is to EB, so is CF to FD,

therefore also, as the square on AE is to the rectangle
EB, so is the square on CF to the rectangle CF, FD.
But the square on AE
on CF;
therefore the rectangle AE,
the rectangle CF, FD.

AE,

is commensurable with the square
EB

is also commensurable with
[v. 16, x. u]

Therefore, if the rectangle AE, EB is rational, the rect­
angle CF, FD will also be rational,
[x. Def. 4~
and if the rectangle AE, EB is medial, the rectangle CF, FD
is also medial.
[x. 23, Por.]
Therefore CD is an apotome of a medial straight line and
the same in order with AB.

then, since AE, EB are incommensur­
able in square,
[x. 76]
therefore CF, FD are also incommensurable in square, [x. 13]
N o w since, as AE is to EB, so is CF to FD, [v. 12, v. 16]
therefore also, as the square on AE is to the square on EB,
so is the square on CF to the square on FD.
[vi. 22]
Therefore, componendo, as the squares on AE, EB are to
the square on EB, so are the squares on CF, FD to the
square on FD.
[v. 18]
But the square on BE is commensurable with the square
on DF;
therefore the sum of the squares on AE, EB is also commen­
surable with the sum of the squares on CF, FD.
[v. 16, x. n]
But the sum of the squares on AE, EB is rational; [x. 76]
therefore the sum of the squares on CF, FD is also rational.
