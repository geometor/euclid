EB,

Again, since, as the square ox\AE
is to the rectangle
so is the square on CF to the rectangle CF, FD,

while the square on AE
on CF,

AE,

is commensurable with the square

therefore the rectangle AE,
the rectangle CF, FD.
But the rectangle AE,

EB
EB

is also commensurable with
is medial;

[x. 76]

therefore the rectangle CF, FD is also medial;

[x. 23, Por.]

therefore CF, FD are straight lines incommensurable in square
which make the sum of the squares on them rational, but the
rectangle contained by them medial.
Therefore CD is minor.

PROPOSITION

A straight
line commensurable
with that which
produces
with a rational area a medial whole is a straight line which
produces with a rational area a medial whole.
Let AB be a straight line which produces with a rational
area a medial whole,
and CD commensurable with AB ;
I say that CD is also a straight line
which produces with a rational area a
medial whole.
For let BE

be the annex to AB ;

therefore AE, EB are straight lines incommensurable in
square which make the sum of the squares on AE,
EB
medial, but the rectangle contained by them rational.
[x. 77]
Let the same construction be made.
Then we can prove, in manner similar to the foregoing,
that CF, FD are in the same ratio as AE,
EB,
the sum of the squares on AE, EB
the sum of the squares on CF, FD,
and the rectangle AE,

EB

is commensurable with

with the rectangle CF,

FD;

so that CF, FD are also straight lines incommensurable in
square which make the sum of the squares on CF, FD medial,
but the rectangle contained by them rational.
