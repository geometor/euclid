Therefore CD is a straight line which produces with a
rational area a medial whole.

A straight line commensurable
with that which
produces
with a medial area a medial whole is itself also a straight line
which produces with a medial area a medial whole.
Let AB be a straight line which produces with a medial
area a medial whole,
and let CD be commensurable with

AB;
A

I say that CD is also a straight line
which produces with a medial area a
medial whole.
For let BE be the annex to AB,

B

E

'
1

and let the same construction be made;
therefore AE,
EB are straight lines incommensurable in
square which make the sum of the squares on them medial,
the rectangle contained by them medial, and further the sum
of the squares on them incommensurable with the rectangle
contained by them.

CF,

Now, as was proved, AE,
FD,

EB

the sum of the squares on AE,
squares on CF, FD,
and the rectangle AE,

EB

are commensurable with
EB

with the sum of the

with the rectangle CF,

FD;

therefore CF, FD are also straight lines incommensurable in
square which make the sum of the squares on them medial,
the rectangle contained by them medial, and further the sum
of the squares on them incommensurable with the rectangle
contained by them.
Therefore CD is a straight line which produces with a
medial area a medial whole.
