If from a rational area a medial area be subtracted,
the
"side" of the remaining
area becomes one of two
irrational
straight lines, either an apotome or a minor straight
line.
For from the rational area BC let the medial area BD
subtracted;

be

I say that the " side " of the
remainder EC becomes one
of two irrational straight lines,
either an apotome or a minor
straight line.
For let a rational straight
line EG be set out,
to EG let there be applied the
rectangular parallelogram GH
equal to BC,
and let GK equal to DB be subtracted :
therefore the remainder EC is equal to LH.
Since then BC is rational, and BD medial,
while BC is equal to GH, and BD to GK,
therefore GH is rational, and GK medial.
And they are applied to the rational straight line EG;
therefore EH is rational and commensurable in length with
EG,
[x. 20]
while EK is rational and incommensurable in length with EG;
[x. 22]
therefore EH is incommensurable in length with EK.
[x. 13]
Therefore EH, EK are rational straight lines commen­
surable in square only ;
therefore KH is an apotome [x. 73], and KF the annex to it.
Now the square on HE is greater than the square on EK
by the square on a straight line either commensurable with
HE or not commensurable.
First, let the square on it be greater by the square on a
straight line commensurable with it.
Now the whole HE is commensurable in length with the
rational straight line EG set out;
therefore KH is a first apotome.
