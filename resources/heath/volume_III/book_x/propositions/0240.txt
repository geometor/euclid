But the " side " of the rectangle contained by a rational
straight line and a first apotome is an apotome.
[x. 91]
Therefore the " side " of LH, that is, oiEC, is an apotome.
But, if the square on HF is greater than the square on
FK
by the square on a straight line incommensurable
with HF,
while the whole FH is commensurable in length with the
rational straight line FG set out,
KH

is a fourth apotome.

But the "side" of the rectangle contained by a rational
straight line and a fourth apotome is minor.

A rational area being of the form kp , and a medial area of the form

according to the different possible relations between k, \.
Suppose that
<r» = kp ,

<TV=JK.

p\

Since <ru is rational and av medial,
» is rational and * cr,
while v is rational and w <r.
Therefore
u ^ v;
thus u, v are rational and
whence (» - v) is an apotome.
T h e possibilities are now as follows.

u.

In both cases u «•> a,
so that (u — v) is either ( 1 ) a first apotome,
or (2) a fourth apotome.
In case (1) -J<r(u — v) is an apotome [x. 9 1 ] ,
but in case (2) J<r(u- v) is a minor irrational straight line [x. 94].
PROPOSITION

109.

If from a medial area a rational area be subtracted,
there
arise two other irrational
straight lines, either a first apotome
of a medial straight line or a straight line which produces with
a rational area a medial
whole.
For from the medial area BC let the rational area BD be
subtracted.
