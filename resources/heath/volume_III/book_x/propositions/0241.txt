I say that the "side" of the remainder EC becomes one
of two irrational straight lines, either a first apotome of a
medial straight line or a straight line which produces with a
rational area a medial whole.
K H

For let a rational straight line EG be set out,
and let the areas be similarly applied.
It follows then that EH is rational and incommensurable
in length with EG,
while KF is rational and commensurable in length with EG;
therefore EH, EK are rational straight lines commensurable
in square only ;
[x. 13]
therefore KH is an apotome, and EK the annex to it. [x. 73]
Now the square on HE is greater than the square on EK
either by the square on a straight line commensurable with
HE or by the square on a straight line incommensurable
with it.
If then the square on HE is greater than the square on
EK by the square on a straight line commensurable with HE,
while the annex EK is commensurable in length with the
rational straight line EG set out,
KH is a second apotome.
[x. Deff. m. 2]
But EG is rational;
so that the " side " of LH, that is, of EC, is a first apotome of
a medial straight line.
[x. 92]
But, if the square on HE is greater than the square on
EK by the square on a straight line incommensurable with HE,
while the annex EK is commensurable in length with the
rational straight line EG set out,
KH is a fifth apotome ;
[x. Deff. m. 5]
so that the "side" of EC is a straight line which produces
with a rational area a medial whole.
[x. 95]
