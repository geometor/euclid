In this case we have to classify

cru = Jk. p ,

Thus, <ru being medial and <rv rational,
u is rational and « cr,
while v is rational and r> cr.
Thus, as before, u, v are rational and

Therefore (u - v) is either (1) a second apotome,

If from a medial area there be subtracted a medial area
incommensurable
with the whole, the two remaining
irrational
straight lines arise, either a second apotome of a medial straight
line or a straight line which produces with a medial area a
medial
whole.
For, as in the foregoing figures, let there be subtracted
from the medial area BC the medial area BD incommensur­
able with the whole;

I say that the " side " of EC is one of two irrational straight
lines, either a second apotome of a medial straight line or a
straight line which produces with a medial area a medial whole.
