For, since each of the rectangles BC, BD
and BC is incommensurable with

is medial,

BD,

it follows that each of the straight lines FH, FK
rational and incommensurable in length with FG.
And, since BC is incommensurable with
that is, GH with
HF

BD,

GK,

is also incommensurable with FK;

therefore FH, FK
in square only;
therefore KH

will be
[x. 22]

[vi. 1, x. u ]

are rational straight lines commensurable

is an apotome.

|x- 73]

If then the square on FH is greater than the square on
FK by the square on a straight line commensurable with FH,
while neither of the straight lines FH, FK is commensurable
in length with the rational straight line FG set out,
KH

is a third apotome.
But KL

[x. Deff. m. 3]

is rational,

and the rectangle contained by a rational straight line and a
third apotome is irrational,
and the " side" of it is irrational, and is called a second
apotome of a medial straight line ;
[x. 93]
so that the " side " of LH,
of a medial straight line.
FK

that is, of EC, is a second apotome

But, if the square on FH is greater than the square on
hy the square on a straight line incommensurable with FH,

while neither of the straight lines HF,
in length with FG,
KH

is a sixth apotome.

FK

is commensurable
[x. Deff. HI. 6]

But the " side " of the rectangle contained by a rational
straight line and a sixth apotome is a straight line which
produces with a medial area a medial whole.
[x. 96]
Therefore the " side " of LH, that is, of EC, is a straight
line which produces with a medial area a medial whole.

We have to classify
J Jk. p - JK . p ,
where Jk. p is incommensurable with J\. p .
