PROPOSITION

The

H I .

apotome is not the same with the binomial straight

line.

Let AB be an apotome ;
I say that AB is not the same with the
binomial straight line.
For, if possible, let it be so;
let a rational straight line DC be set out,
and tc CD let there be applied the
rectangle CE equal to the square on
AB
and producing DE as breadth.
Then, since AB
DE

is an apotome,

is a first apotome.

[x. 97]

Let EE be the annex to it;
therefore DE, EE are rational straight
lines commensurable in square only;
the square on DF is greater than the square on EE by the
square on a straight line commensurable with DF,
and DF is commensurable in length with the rational straight
line DC set out.
[x. Deff. HI. I ]
Again, since AB is binomial,
therefore DE is a first binomial straight line.
Let it be divided into its terms at G,
and let DG be the greater term ;
therefore DG, GE
in square only,

are rational straight lines commensurable
