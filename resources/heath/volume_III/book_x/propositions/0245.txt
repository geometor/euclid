the square on DG is greater than the square on GE by the
square on a straight line commensurable with DG, and the
greater term DG is commensurable in length with the rational
straight line DC set out.

[x. Deff. 11. 1]

Therefore DF is also commensurable in length with

DG;
[x. 12]
therefore the remainder GF is also commensurable in length
with DF.
[x. 15]
But DF is incommensurable in length with EE;
therefore FG is also incommensurable in length with EE. [x. 13]
Therefore GF, EE are rational straight lines commensur­
able in square only;
therefore EG is an apotome.
[x. 73]
But it is also rational:
which is impossible.
Therefore the apotome is not the same with the binomial
straight line.
Q. E. D.


This proposition proves the equivalent of the fact that
Jx + Jy cannot be equal to Jx - Jy, and
x + Jy cannot be equal to x' - Jy'.
We should prove these results by squaring the respective expressions; and
Euclid's procedure corresponds to this exactly.
H e has to prove that
p + Jk. p cannot be equal to p' — J \ . p.
For, if possible, let this be so.
