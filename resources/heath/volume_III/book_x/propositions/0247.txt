following the apotome produce, as breadths, each according
to its own order, apotomes, and those following the binomial
straight line themselves also, according to their order, produce
the binomials as breadths,
therefore those following the apotome are different, and those
following the binomial straight line are different, so that there
are, in order, thirteen irrational straight lines in all,
Medial,
Binomial,
First bimedial,
Second bimedial,
Major,
"Side" of a rational plus a medial area,
" Side " of the sum of two medial areas,
Apotome,
First apotome of a medial straight line,
Second apotome of a medial straight line,
Minor,
Producing with a rational area a medial whole,
Producing with a medial area a medial whole.
PROPOSITION

112.

The square on a rational
straight
line applied
to the
binomial straight
line produces as breadth an apotome the
terms of which are commensurable
with the terms of the bi­
nomial and moreover in the same ratio;
and further
the
apotome so arising will have the same order as the
binomial
straight
line.
Let A be a rational straight line,
let BC be a binomial, and let DC be its greater term ;
let the rectangle BC, EF be equal to the square on A ;

I say that EF is an apotome the terms of which are commen­
surable with CD, DB, and in the same ratio, and further EF
will have the same order as BC.
