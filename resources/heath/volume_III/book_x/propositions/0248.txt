For again let the rectangle BD, G be equal to the square
A.
Since then the rectangle BC, EF is equal to the rectangle
BD,
G,
on

therefore, as CB is to BD,

so is G to EF.

[vi. r6]

But CB is greater than BD ;
therefore G is also greater than EF.
Let EH

be equal to G;

therefore, as CB is to BD,
therefore, separando,

as CD is to BD, so is HF to

But the square on CD is commensurable with the square
on DB;
[x. 36]
therefore the square on HK

And, as the square on HK is to the square on KF, so is
HK to KE, since the three straight lines HK, KF, KE are
proportional.
[v. Def. 9]
Therefore HK is commensurable in length with KE,
so that HE

is also commensurable in length with EK.

Now, since the square on A

therefore the rectangle EH,

And it is applied to the rational straight line
