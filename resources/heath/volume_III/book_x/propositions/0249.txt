Since, then, as CD is to DB,
while CD, DB
only,
therefore FK,

so is FK

to

KE,

are straight lines commensurable in square
KE

are also commensurable in square only.
[X. I I ]

But KE

is rational;

therefore FK is also rational.
Therefore FK, KE
surable in square only;

are rational straight lines commen­

therefore EF is an apotome.

[x. 73]

Now the square on CD is greater than the square on DB
either by the square on a straight line commensurable with
CD or by the square on a straight line incommensurable
with it.
If then the square on CD is greater than the square on
DB by the square on a straight line commensurable with CD,
the square on FK is also greater than the square on KE by
the square on a straight line commensurable with FK.
[x. 14]
And, if CD is commensurable in length with the rational
straight line set out,
so also is FK;

[x. i t , 12]

if BD is so commensurable,
so also is KE;

[x. 12]

but, if neither of the straight lines CD, DB is so commensur­
able,
neither of the straight lines FK, KE is so.
But, if the square on CD is greater than the square on
DB
by the square on a straight line incommensurable
with CD,
the square on FK is also greater than the square on KE by
the square on a straight line incommensurable with FK. [x. 14]
And, if CD is commensurable with the rational straight
line set out,
so also is

FK;

if BD is so commensurable,
so also is KE ;
