The square on a rational straight line, if applied to an
apotome, produces as< breadth the binomial straight
line the
terms of which are commensurable
with the terms of the
apotome and in the same ratio;
and further
the
binomial
so arising has the same order as the apotome.
Let A be a. rational straight line and BD
and let the rectangle BD, KH be equal to
the square on A, so that the square on the
rational straight line A when applied to the
apotome BD produces KH as breadth ;
I say that KH is a binomial straight line the
terms of which are commensurable with the
terms of BD and in the same ratio; and
further KH has the same order as BD.

an apotome,

For let DC be the annex to BD ;
therefore BC, CD are rational straight lines commensurable
in square only.
[x. 73]
Let the rectangle BC, G be also equal to the square on A.
But the square on A is rational;
therefore the rectangle BC, G is also rational.
A n d it has been applied to the rational straight line

BC;

therefore G is rational and commensurable in length with BC.
