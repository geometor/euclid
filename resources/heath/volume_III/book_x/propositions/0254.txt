But BC, CD are rational straight lines commensurable in
square only ;
therefore KF, FH are also rational straight lines [x. Def. 3]
commensurable in square only ;
therefore KH

is binomial.

[x. 36]

If now the square on BC is greater than the square on CD
by the square on a straight line commensurable with BC,
the square on KF will also be greater than the square on FH
by the square on a straight line commensurable with KF. [x 14]
And, if BC is commensurable in length with the rational
straight line set out,
so also is KF;
if CD is commensurable in length with the rational straight
line set out,
so also is FH,
but, if neither of the straight lines BC, CD,
then neither of the straight lines KF,

FH.

But, if the square on BC is greater than the square on CD
by the square on a straight line incommensurable with BC,
the square on KF is also greater than the square on FH by
the square on a straight line incommensurable with KF. [x. 14]
And, if BC is commensurable with the rational straight
line set out,
so also is KF;
if CD is so commensurable,
so also is FH;
but, if neither of the straight lines BC, CD,
then neither of the straight lines KF,
FH.
Therefore KH is a binomial straight line, ..he terms of
which KF, FH are commensurable with the terms BC, CD of
the apotome and in the same ratio,
and further KH has the same order as BD.

This proposition, which is companion to the preceding, gives us the equiva­
lent of the rationalisation of the denominator of
