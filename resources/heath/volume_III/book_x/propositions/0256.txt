If an area be contained by an apotome and the binomial
straight line the terms of which are commensurable
with the
terms of the apotome and in the same ratio, the " side " of the
area is rational.
For let an area, the rectangle AB,
the apotome AB and the binomial
straight line CD,

CD, be contained by

A

and let CE be the greater term of
the latter;
let the terms CE, ED
of the
binomial straight line be commensurable with the terms AF, FB of
the apotome and in the same ratio;
and let the "side" of the rectangle
AB, CD be G ;
I say that G is rational.

For let a rational straight line H be set out,
and to CD let there be applied a rectangle equal to the square
on H and producing KL as breadth.
Therefore KL is an apotome.
Let its terms be KM, ML commensurable with the terms
CE, ED of the binomial straight line and in the same ratio.
