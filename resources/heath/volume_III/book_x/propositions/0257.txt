But CE, ED are also commensurable with AF,
the same ratio;
therefore, as AF

is to FB, so is KM

Therefore, alternately, as AF
therefore also the remainder AB
AF is to KM.
But AF\s
therefore AB

to

FB and in

ML.

is to KM,

so is BE to

LM;

is to the remainder KL as
[v. 19]

commensurable with KM;

[x. 12]

is also commensurable with KL.

[x. n ]

And, as AB is to KL, so is the rectangle CD, AB to the
rectangle CD, KL ;
[vi. 1]
therefore the rectangle CD, AB is also commensurable with
the rectangle CD, KL.
[x. "]
But the rectangle CD, KL is equal to the square on H;
therefore the rectangle CD, AB is commensurable with the
square on H.
But the square on G is equal to the rectangle CD,

AB;

therefore the square on G is commensurable with the square
onH.
But the square on H is rational;
therefore the square on G is also rational;
therefore G is rational.
And it is the "side" of the rectangle CD,

AB.

Therefore etc.
PORISM.
And it is made manifest to us by this also that
it is possible for a rational area to be contained by irrational
straight lines.
Q. E. D.


This theorem is equivalent to the proof of the fact that
J(JA - JB){\ JA + X JB) JX(A-B),
and
J\ ~ JBJ~(Xa + X JB) = Jx(a'~B).
a

T h e result of the theorem x. 112 is used for the purpose thus.
We have to prove that
J(p-JA.p)(\p
+
kJk. )
is rational
By x . 112 we have, if cr is a rational straight line,
