Now
p:\'p = Jk.p :\' Jk.p = (p-Jk.p)

so that
(p- Jk .p)~ (X'p - X' Jk . p).
Multiplying each by (Xp + X Jk. p), we have

That is,

PROPOSITION

115.

From a medial straight line there arise irrational
straight
lines infinite in number, and none of them is the same as any
of the preceding.
Let A be a medial straight line ;
I say that from A there arise
irrational straight lines infinite in
number, and none of them is the
same as any of the preceding.
Let a rational straight line B
be set out,
D
and let the square on C be equal
to the rectangle B, A ;
therefore C is irrational;
[x. Def. 4]
for that which is contained by an irrational and a rational
straight line is irrational.
[deduction from x. 20]
And it is not the same with any of the preceding;
for the square on none of the preceding, if applied to a rational
straight line produces as breadth a medial straight line.
Again, let the square on D be equal to the rectangle B, C;
therefore the square on D is irrational.
[deduction from x. 20]
A

0

Therefore D is irrational;

[x. Def. 4]

and it is not the same with any of the preceding, for the
square on none of the preceding, if applied to a rational
straight line, produces C as breadth.
Similarly, if this arrangement proceeds ad infinitum,
it
is manifest that from the medial straight line there arise
irrational straight lines infinite in number, and none is the
same with any of the preceding.
Q. E. D.
