W e now pass to the trinomial etc., with the commentator's further remarks
about them.
( i ) The trinomial. " Suppose three rational straight lines commensurable in
square only. T h e line composed of two of these lines, that is, the binomial
straight line, is irrational, and, in consequence, the area contained by this line
and the remaining line is irrational, and, likewise, the double of the area
contained by these two lines will be irrational.
T h u s the square on the
whole line composed of three lines is irrational and consequently the line is
irrational, and it is called a trinomial straight line."
It is easy to see that this " p r o o f " is not conclusive as stated. Nor does
Woepcke seem to show how the proposition can be proved on Euclidean
lines. But I think it would be somewhat as follows.
Suppose x, y, z to be rational and <•«•.
T h e n x , y , z are rational, and zyz, 2zx, 2xy are all medial.
First, (2yz + 2zx + 2xy) cannot be rational.
For suppose this sum equal to a rational area, say a .

Since

2yz + zx + xy = a ,

2zx + 2xy = a"

- yz,

or the sum of two medial areas incommensurable with one another is equal to
the difference between a rational area and a medial area.
But the " s i d e " of the sum of the two medial areas must [x. 72] be one of
two irrationals with a positive sign; and the " side " of the difference between a
rational area and a medial area must [x. 108] be one of two irrationals with a
negative sign.
A n d the first " s i d e " cannot be the same as the second [x. i n and ex­
planation following].
Therefore
2zx + 2xy # cr - yz,
2

2

and

2yz + 2zx + 2xy is consequently irrational.
2

Therefore

2

(x +y + z ) ^ (2yz + 2zx + ixy),
2

whence

2

2

2

( * + y + z) K> (x +y + z ),

so that (x +y + z) , and therefore also (x +y + z), is irrational.
T h e commentator goes on :
" A n d , if we have four lines commensurable in square, as we have said, the
procedure will be exactly the same; and we shall treat the succeeding lines in
an analogous manner."
Without speculating further as to how the extension was made to the
quadrinomial etc., we may suppose with Woepcke that Apollonius probably
investigated the multinomial
