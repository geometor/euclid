T h e first trimedial straight line.

T h e commentator here says: " Suppose we nave three medial lines com­
mensurable in square [only], one of which contains with each of the two others
a rational rectangle; then the straight line composed of the two lines is
irrational and is called the first bimedial; the remaining line is medial, and
the area contained by these two lines is irrational. Consequently the square
on the whole line is irrational."
T o begin with, the conditions here given are incompatible. If x, y, 2 be
medial straight lines such that xy, xz are both rational,
y : z = xy : xz = m : n,
and y, 2 are commensurable in length and not in square only.
Hence it seems that we must, with Woepcke, understand " three medial
straight lines such that one is commensurable with each of the other two in
square only and makes with it a rational rectangle."
If x, y, z be the three medial straight lines,
(X + V + Z ) r> X

so that (x + y + z ) is medial.
Also we have 2xy, 2xz both rational and 2/2 medial.
Now (x +y + 2 ) + 2yz + 2xy + xz cannot be rational, for, if it were, the
sum of two medial areas, (x* +f + 2 ), 2/2, would be rational: which is im­
possible. [Cf. x . 72.]

T h e second trimedial straight line.

Suppose x, y, 2 to be medial straight lines commensurable in square only
and containing with each other medial rectangles.

Then

(x +y + z ) « x , and is medial.

Also

2_yz, 2zx, 2xy are all medial areas.

T o prove the irrationality in this case I presume that the metnod would
be like that of x . 38 about the second bimedial.
Suppose cf to be a rational straight line and let

2yz = au
2ZX = <rv
2xy = aw

Here, since, e.g.,
xz : xy = v : w,
or
z : y = v. w,
and similarly
x : z = w : u,
u, v, w are commensurable in square only.
Also, since
t is incommensurable with w.
