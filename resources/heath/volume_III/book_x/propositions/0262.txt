Similarly
But

t is incommensurable with u, v.
/, u, v, w are all rational and « - o-.

Therefore (/ + » + v + zc) is a quadrinomial and therefore irrational.
Therefore <r (/ + « + v + w), or (x+y + z)\ is irrational,
whence
(x +y + z) is irrational.

T h e »a/t>r made up of three straight lines.

T h e commentator describes this as " the line composed of three straight
lines incommensurable in square and. such that one of them gives with each
of the other two a sum of squares (which is) rational, while the rectangle
contained by the two lines is medial."
If
y, z are the three straight lines, this would indicate
(x*+y) rational,

(x + z ) rational,
iyz medial.
Woepcke points out (pp. 696—8, note) the difficulties connected with this
supposition or the supposition of

(x +y ) rational,
(x + z ) rational,
2xy (or 2xz) medial,
and concludes that what is meant is the supposition
(x* +y ) rational
xy medial xz medial .
(though the text is against this).
T h e assumption of (x* +y') and (x + z ) being concurrently rational is
certainly further removed from Euclid, for x . 33 only enables us to find one
pair of lines having the property, as x, y.
But we will not pursue these speculations further.

A s regards further irrationals formed by subtraction the commentator
writes as follows.
" Again, it is not necessary that, in the irrational straight lines formed by
means of subtraction, we should confine ourselves to making one subtraction
only, so as to obtain the apotome, or the first apotome of the medial, or the
second apotome of the medial, or the minor, or the straight line which
produces with a rational area a medial whole, or that which produces with a
medial area a medial whole; but we shall be able here to make two or three
or four subtractions.
" When we d o that, we show in manner analogous to the foregoing that
the lines which remain are irrational and that each of them is one of the lines
formed by subtraction. That is to say that, if from a rational line we cut off
another rational line commensurable with the whole line in square, we obtain,
for remainder, an a p o t o m e ; and, if we subtract from this line (which is)
cut off and rational—that which Euclid calls the annex (irp«rap/io£owa)—
another rational line which is commensurable with it in square, we obtain, as
the remainder, an apotome; likewise, if we cut off from the rational line cut
