DEFINITIONS.

1.

A solid is that which has length, breadth, and depth.

2.

A n extremity of a solid is a surface.

3. A straight line is at right angles to a plane,
when it makes right angles with all the straight lines which
meet it and are in the plane.
4. A plane is at right angles to a plane when the
straight lines drawn, in one of the planes, at right angles to
the common section of the planes are at right angles to the
remaining plane.
5. T h e inclination of a straight line to a plane
is, assuming a perpendicular drawn from the extremity of
the straight line which is elevated above the plane to the
plane, and a straight line joined from the point thus arising
to the extremity of the straight line which is in the plane,
the angle contained by the straight line so drawn and the
straight line standing up.
6. T h e inclination of a plane to a plane is the acute
angle contained by the straight lines drawn at right angles
to the common section at the same point, one in each of the
planes.
7. A plane is said to be similarly inclined to a plane
as another is to another when the said angles of the inclina­
tions are equal to one another.
8.

Parallel planes are those which do not meet.
