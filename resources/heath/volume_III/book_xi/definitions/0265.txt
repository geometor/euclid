9. Similar solid figures are those contained by similar
planes equal in multitude.
10. Equal and similar solid figures are those con­
tained by similar planes equal in multitude and in magnitude.
11. A solid angle is the inclination constituted by more
than two lines which meet one another and are not in the
same surface, towards all the lines.
Otherwise: A solid angle is that which is contained by
more than two plane angles which are not in the same plane
and are constructed to one point.
12. A pyramid is a solid figure, contained by planes,
which is constructed from one plane to one point.
13. A prism is a solid figure contained by planes two
of which, namely those which are opposite, are equal, similar
and parallel, while the rest are parallelograms.
14. When, the diameter of a semicircle remaining fixed,
the semicircle is carried round and restored again to the same
position from which it began to be moved, the figure so
comprehended is a sphere.
15. T h e axis of the sphere is the straight line which
remains fixed and about which the semicircle is turned.
16. T h e centre of the sphere is the same as that
of the semicircle.
17. A diameter of the sphere is any straight line
drawn through the centre and terminated in both directions
by the surface of the sphere.
18. When, one side of those about the right angle in a
right-angled triangle remaining fixed, the triangle is carried
round and restored again to the same position from which it
began to be moved, the figure so comprehended is a cone.
And, if the straight line which remains fixed be equal to
the remaining side about the right angle which is carried
round, the cone will be right-angled; if less, obtuse-angled ;
and if greater, acute-angled.
19. T h e axis of the cone is the straight line which
remains fixed and about which the triangle is turned.
