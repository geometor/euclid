(iv. i, 208 b i 3 s q q . ) he speaks of the " d i m e n s i o n s " as six, dividing each of
the three into two opposites, " up and down, before and behind, right and left,"
though of course, as he explains, these terms are relative.
Heron, as might be expected, combines the two forms of the definition.
" A solid body is that which has length, breadth, and depth: or that which
possesses the three dimensions." (Def. 1 1 . )
Similarly Theon of Smyrna (p. i n , 19, ed. Hiller): " that which is extended
(SuMrraTdV) and divisible in three directions is solid, having length, breadth
and depth."

In like manner Aristotle says (Metaph. 1066 b 23) that the notion (Ao'yos)
of body is "that which is bounded by surfaces" (rawc'Son in this case) and
(Metaph. 1060 b 15) "surfaces (orirpaVeiai) are divisions of bodies."
So Heron (Def. 11.): " E v e r y solid is bounded (irfpaTovTcu) by surfaces, and
is produced when a surface is moved from a forward position in a backward
direction."

This definition and the next are given almost word for word by Heron
(Def. i i ) .
That a straight line can be so related to a plane as described in Def. 3 is
established in x i . 4. T h e fact has been made the basis of a definition of a
plane which is attributed by Crelle to Fourier, and is as follows. " A plane is
formed by the totality of all the straight lines which, passing through one and
the same point of a straight line in space, stand perpendicular to it." Stated
in this form, the definition is open to the objection that the conception of a
right angle, involving the measurement of angles, presupposes a plane, inasmuch
as the measurement of angles depends ultimately upon the superposition of two
planes and their coincidence throughout when two lines in one coincide with
two lines in the other respectively. Cf. my note on 1. Def. 7, Vol. 1. pp. 1 7 3 — 5 .

Both this definition and Def. 6 use the common section of two planes,
though it is not till x i . 3 that this common section is proved to be a straight
line. T h e definition however, just like Def. 3, is legitimate, because the object
is to explain the meaning of terms, not to prove anything
The definition of perpendicular planes is made by Legendre a particular
case of Def. 6, the limiting case, namely, where the angle representing the
" inclination of a plane to a plane " is a right angle.
