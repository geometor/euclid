For, if possible, let a part AB of the straight line
ABC
be in the plane of reference, and a part
BC
in a plane more elevated.

There will then be in the plane of
reference some straight line continuous
with AB
in a straight line.
Let it be BD ;
therefore AB is a common segment of the
two straight lines ABC, ABD :
which is impossible, inasmuch as, if we
describe a circle with centre B and distance
AB,
the diameters will cut off unequal circumferences of the
circle.
Therefore a part of a straight line cannot be in the plane
of reference, and a part in a plane more elevated.

There is no doubt that the proofs of the first three propositions are
unsatisfactory owing to the fact that Euclid is not able to make any use of his
definition of a plane for the purpose of these proofs, and they really depend
upon truths which can only be assumed as axiomatic. T h e definition of a plane
as that surface which lies evenly with the straight lines on itself, whatever its
exact meaning may be, is nowhere appealed to as a criterion to show whether
a particular surface is or is not a plane. If the meaning of it is what I conjec­
ture in the note on Book I., Def. 7 (Vol. 1. p. 171), if, namely, it only tries to
express without an appeal to sight what Plato meant by the " middle covering
the extremities " (i.e. apparently, in the case of a plane, the fact that a plane
looked at edgewise takes the form of a straight line), then it is perhaps
possible to connect the definition with a method of generating a plane which
