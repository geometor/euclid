And, because the points B, C are in this plane, the straight line BC is
in it.
[Simson's def.]
Therefore there are two straight lines ABC, ABD in the same plane that
have a common segment AB :
which is impossible."
Simson, o f course, justifies the last inference by reference to his Corollary
to i. I I , which, however, as we have seen, is not a valid proof of the assump­
tion, which is really implied in i. Post. 2.
A n alternative reading, perhaps due to Theon, says, after the words
" w h i c h is impossible" in the Greek text, "for a straight line does not meet a
straight line in more points than o n e ; otherwise the straight lines will
coincide." Simson (who however does not seem to have had the second
clause beginning " otherwise " in the text which he used) attacks this alterna­
tive reading in a rather confused note chiefly directed against a criticism by
Thomas Simpson, without (as it seems to me) sufficient reason. It contains
surely a legitimate argument. T h e supposed straight lines ABC, ABD meet
in more than two points, namely in alt the points between A and B. But two
straight lines cannot have two points common without coinciding altogether;
therefore ABC must coincide with ABD.

For let the two straight lines AB,
the point E ;

they are in one plane,
CD cut one another at

I say that AB, CD are in one plane,
and every triangle is in one plane.
For

let points F, G be taken at

let CB,

FG

and let FH,

EB,

be joined,
GK be drawn across ;

I say first that the triangle ECB

in one plane.
For, if part of the-triangle
ECB,
either FHC or GBK, is in the plane of reference, and the rest
in another,
a part also of one of the straight lines EC, EB

But,

if the part FCBG

of the triangle ECB

be in the

plane of reference, and the rest in another,
a part also of both the straight lines EC,

EB

will be in the

plane of reference and a part in another :
which was proved absurd.
