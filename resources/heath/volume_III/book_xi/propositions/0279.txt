Therefore the triangle ECB is in one plane.
But, in whatever plane the triangle ECB is, in that plane
also is each of the straight lines EC, EB,
and, in whatever plane each of the straight lines EC, EB is,
in that plane are AB, CD also.
[xi. 1]
Therefore the straight lines AB,

CD are in one plane,

and every triangle is in one plane.
Q. E. D.


It must be admitted that the " p r o o f " of this proposition is not of any
value. For one thing, Euclid only takes certain triangles and a certain
quadrilateral respectively forming part of the original triangle, and argues
about these. But, for anything we are supposed to know, there may be some
part of '.he triangle bounded (let us say) by some curve which is not in the
same plane with the triangle.
We may agree with Simson that it would be preferable to enunciate the
proposition as follows.
Two straight lines which intersect are in one plane, and three straight lines
which intersect two and two are in one plane.
Adopting Smith and Bryant's figure in preference to Simson's, we suppose
three straight lines PQ, RS, XYto intersect
two and two in A, B, C.

Then Simson's proof (adopted by Legen\

dre also) proceeds thus.

Let any plane pass through the straight

line PQ, and let this plane be turned about

passes through the point C.

Then, since the points A, C are in this

plane, the straight line AC (and therefore

the straight line RS produced indefinitely)

lies wholly in the plane.
[Simson's def.]
For the same reason, since the points B, C are in the plane, the straight
line X Y lies wholly in the plane.
Hence all three straight lines PQ, RS, XY (and of course any pair of
them) lie in one plane.
But it has still to be proved that there is only one plane passing through
the three straight lines.
This may be done, as in Mr Taylor's Euclid, thus.
Suppose, if possible, that there are two different planes through A, B, C.
T h e straight lines BC, CA, AB then lie wholly in each of the two planes.
Now any straight line in one of the two planes must intersect at least two
of the straight lines (produced if necessary);

B

let it intersect two of them in K, L.
Then, since K, L are also in the second plane,- the line KL lies wholly in
that plane.
Hence every straight line in either of the planes lies wholly in the other
a l s o ; and therefore the planes are coincident throughout their whole surface.
