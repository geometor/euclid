It follows from the above that
A plane is determined (i.e. uniquely detertnined) by any of the following data:
(1) by three straight lines meeting one another two and two,
(2) by three points not in a straight line,
(3) by two straight lines meeting one another,
(4) by a straight line and a point without it.

For let the two planes AB, BC cut one another,
and let the line DB be their common

I say that the line DB is a straight line.

For, if not, from D to B let the straight
line DEB
be joined in the plane AB, and
in the plane BC the straight line DEB.
Then the two straight lines DEB, DEB
will have the same extremities, and will
clearly enclose an area:

Therefore DEB, DEB are not straight lines.
Similarly we can prove that neither will there be any
other straight line joined from D to B except DB the common
section of the planes AB,
BC.
Therefore etc.
Q. E. D.


I think Simson is right in objecting to the words after " which is absurd,"
to the effect that DEB, DEB are not straight lines, and that neither can there
be any other straight line joined from D to B except DB, as being unneces­
sary. It is right to conclude at once from the absurdity that BD cannot but
be a straight line.
Legendre makes his proof depend on Prop. 2. " For, if, among the points
common to the two planes, three should be found which are not in a straight
line, the two planes in question, each passing through three points, would only
amount to one and the same plane." [This of course assumes that three
points determine one and only one plane, which, strictly speaking, involves
more than Prop. 2 itself, as shown in the last note.]
A favourite proposition in modern text-books is the following. T h e proof
seems to be due to von Staudt (Killing, Grundlagen der Geometrie, Vol. n .
P- 43)-
