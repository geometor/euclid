If two planes meet in a point, they meet in a straight line.
Let ABC, ADE be two given planes meeting
at A.
T a k e any points B, C lying on the plane ABC,
and not on the plane ADE but on the same side
of it.
Join AB, A C, and produce BA to F.
Join CF.
Then, since B, F are on opposite sides of the
plane ADE,
C, Fare also on opposite sides of it.
Therefore CF must meet the plane ADE in
some point, say G.
Then, since A, G are both in each of the planes ABC, ADE, the straight
line A G is in both planes.
[Simson's def.]
This is also the place to insert the proposition that, If three planes intersect
two and two, their lines of intersection either meet in a point or are parallel two
and two.
Let there be three planes intersecting in the straight lines AB, CD, EF.

Now AB, EF are in a plane; therefore they either meet in a point or are
parallel.
(1) L e t them meet in 0.
T h e n 0, being a point in AB, lies in the plane AD, and, being also a
point in EF, lies also in the plane ED.
Therefore O, being common to the planes AD, DE, must lie on CD, the
line of their intersection;
i.e. CD, if produced, passes through O.
(2) Let AB, EFnot meet, but let them be parallel.
Then CD cannot meet AB; for, if it did, it must necessarily meet EF,
by the first case.
Therefore CD, AB, being in one plane, are parallel.
Similarly CD, EFaxe parallel.

If a straight line be set up at right angles to two straight
lines which cut one another, at their common point of section,
it will also be at right angles to the plane through
them.
