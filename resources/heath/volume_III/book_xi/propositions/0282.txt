For let a straight line EF be set up at right angles to the
two straight lines AB, CD, which
cut one another at the point E,
1
from E;
I say that EF is also at right
angles to the plane through AB,
For let AE, EB, CE, ED be
cut off equal to one another,
and let any straight line GEH be drawn across through E,
at random ;
let AD, CB be joined,
and further let FA, FG, FD, EC, FN, FB be joined from
the point F taken at random < o n
EF>.
Now, since the two straight lines AE, ED are equal to
the two straight lines CE, EB, and contain equal angles, [1. 15]
therefore the base AD is equal to the base CB,
and the triangle A ED will be equal to the triangle CEB; [1.4]
so that the angle DAE
is also equal to the angle EBC.
But the angle AEG is also equal to the angle BEH;
[1.15]
therefore AGE,
BEH
are two triangles which have two
angles equal to two angles respectively, and one side equal
to one side, namely that adjacent to the equal angles, that
is to say, AE to
EB;
therefore they will also have the remaining sides equal to the
remaining sides.
[>• 26]
Therefore GE is equal to EH, and AG to BH.
And, since AE is equal to EB,
while EE is common and at right angles,
therefore the base FA is equal to the base FB.
For the same reason
EC is also equal to FD.

[1. 4]

And, since AD is equal to CB,
and FA is also equal to FB,
the two sides FA, AD are equal to the two sides FB, BC
respectively ;
and the base FD was proved equal to the base EC;
therefore the angle FAD is also equal to the angle FBC. [1.8]
