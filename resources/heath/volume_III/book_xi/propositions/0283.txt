And since, again, A G was proved equal to BH,
and further FA also equal to FB,
the two sides FA, AG are equal to the two sides FB

BH.

And the angle FAG was proved equal to the angle
therefore the base FG is equal to the base FH.

FBH;
[1. 4]

Now since, again, GB was proved equal to BH,
and EF is common,
the two sides GE, EF are equal to the two sides HE,
EF;
and the base FG is equal to the base FH;
therefore the angle GEE is equal to the angle HEF.
[1. 8 ]
Therefore each of the angles GEE, HEF is right.
Therefore EE is at right angles to GH drawn at random
through E.
Similarly we can prove that EE will also make right
angles with all the straight lines which meet it and are in the
plane of reference.
But a straight line is at right angles to a plane when it
makes right angles with all the straight lines which meet it
and are in that same plane;
f x i . Def. 3]
therefore EE is at right angles to the plane of reference.
But the plane of reference is the plane through the straight
lines AB,
CD.
Therefore EE is at right angles to the plane through
AB,
CD.
Therefore etc.
Q. E. D.


T h e steps to be successively proved in order to establish this proposition
by Euclid's method are
(1) triangles AED, BEC equal in all respects,

[by 1. 4]

(2) triangles AEG, BEH equal in all respects,
so that AG is equal to BH, and GE to EH,
(3) triangles AEF, BEE equal in all respects,
so that AE\s equal to BE,
(4) likewise triangles CEE, DEE,
so that CE is equal to DE,
(5) triangles FAD, FBC equal in all respects,
so that the angles FAG, FBH axe. equal,
(6) triangles FAG, FBH equal in all respects,
so that FG is equal to FH,
