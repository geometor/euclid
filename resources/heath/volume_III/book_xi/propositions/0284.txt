(7) triangles FEG, FEH equal in all respects,
[by (2), (6) and I. 8]
so that the angles EEG, FEH axe equal,
and therefore EE is at right angles to GH.
In consequence of the length of the above proof others have been
suggested, and the proof which now finds most general acceptance is that of
Cauchy, which is as follows.
Let AB be perpendicular to two straight lines BC, BD in the plane MN
at their point of intersection B.
In the plane MNfaaw BE, any straight line
through B.
Join CD, and let CD meet BE in E.
Produce AB to F so that BF is equal to AB.
Join AC, AE, AD, CF, EF, DF.
Since BC is perpendicular to AF at its
middle point B,
AC is equal to CF.
Similarly AD is equal to DF.
Since in the triangles A CD, FCD the two
sides AC, CD are respectively equal to the two
sides EC, CD, and the third sides AD, FD are
also equal,
the angles A CD, FCD are equal.
[1. 8]
T h e triangles ACE, FCE thus have two sides and the included angle
equal, whence
EA is equal to EF.
[1. 4]
T h e triangles ABE, FBE have now all their sides equal respectively;
therefore the angles ABE, FBE are equal,
[1. 8]
and AB is perpendicular to BE.
A n d BE is in any straight line through B in the plane MN.
Legendre's proof is not so easy, but it is interesting.
to draw through any point £ within the angle
CBD a straight line CD bisected at E.
T o do this we draw EK parallel to DB
meeting BC in K, and then mark off KC equal
to BK.
CE is then joined and produced to D; and
CD is the straight line required.
Now, joining AC, AE, AD in the figure
above, we have, since CD is bisected at E,
(1) in the triangle A CD,

We are first required

AC + AD = 2AE + 2 ED ,
and also (2) in the triangle BCD,
BC' + BD = 2BE + 2ED .
Subtracting, and remembering that the triangles ABC,
angled, so that
AC -BC
= AB ,
and
AD" - BD = AB ,
we have
2AB = 2AE - 2BE ,
or
AE = AB + BE ,
