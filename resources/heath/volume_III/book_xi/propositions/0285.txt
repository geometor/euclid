whence [1. 48] the angle ABE is a right angle, and AB is perpendicular
to BE.
It follows of course from this proposition that the perpendicular AB is the
shortest distance from A to the plane M N .
And it can readily be proved that,
If from a point without a plane oblique straight lines be drawn to the plane,
(1) those meeting the plane at equal distances from the foot of the perpendicular
are equal, and
(2) of two straight lines meeting the plane at unequal distances from the foot of
the perpendicular, the more remote is the greater.
Lastly, it is easily seen that
From a point outside a plane only one perpendicular can be drawn to that
plane.
For, if possible, let there be two perpendiculars. Then a plane can be
drawn through them, and this will cut the original plane in a straight line.
This straight line and the two perpendiculars will form a plane triangle
which has two right angles: which is impossible.

PROPOSITION

5.

If a straight line be set up at right angles to three
straight
lines which meet one another, at their common point of section,
the three straight lines are in one plane.
For let a straight line AB be set up at right angles to the
three straight lines BC, BD, BE,
at
their point of meeting at B;
A
I say that BC, BD, BE are in one plane.

For suppose they are not, but, if
possible, let BD, BE be in the plane of
reference and BC in one more elevated ;
let the plane through AB,
BC
be
produced;

it will thus make, as common section in the plane of reference,
a straight line.
[xi. 3]
Let it make BE.
Therefore the three straight lines AB, BC, BE are in one
plane, namely that drawn through AB,
BC.
Now, since AB
lines BD,
BE,
therefore AB
BD, BE.

is at right angles to each of the straight

is also at right angles to the plane through
