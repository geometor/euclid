(1) it would intersect AB at O but not pass through OQ, or
(2) it would intersect AB at a point different from O.
In either case, an absurdity would result.

PROPOSITION

If two straight lines be at right
the straight lines will be parallel.

angles

to the same

plane,

For let the two straight lines AB, CD be at right angles
to the plane of reference ;
I say that AB is parallel to CD.
For let them meet the plane of
reference at the points B, D,
let the straight line BD be joined,
let DE be drawn, in the plane of
reference, at right angles to BD,
let DE be made equal to AB,
and let BE, AE, AD be joined.
Now, since A Bis at right angles to the plane of reference,
it will also make right angles with all the straight lines which
meet it and are in the plane of reference.
[xi. Def. 3 ]
But each of the straight lines BD, BE is in the plane of
reference and meets A B ;
therefore each of the angles ABD, ABE is right.
For the same reason
each of the angles CDB, CDE is also right.
And, since AB is equal to
and BD is common,
the two sides AB,

DE,

BD are equal to the two sides ED,

and they include right angles ;
therefore the base AD is equal to the base

BE.

And, since AB is equal to DE,
while AD is also equal to BE,
the two sides AB, BE are equal to the two sides ED,
and AE is their common base ;
therefore the angle ABE

is equal to the angle EDA.
