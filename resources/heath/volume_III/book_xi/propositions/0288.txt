But the angle ABE
therefore the angle EDA
therefore ED

is right;
is also right;

is at right angles to

DA.

But it is also at right angles to each of the straight lines
BD,
DC;
therefore ED is set up at right angles to the three straight
lines BD, DA, DC at their point of meeting ;
therefore the three straight lines BD, DA, DC are in one
plane.
[xi. 5]
But,
also,

in whatever plane DB,

DA

are, in that plane is

for every triangle is in one plane ;
therefore the straight lines AB,
And

[xi. 2]

BD,

each of the angles A BD,

therefore AB

DC are in one plane.

BDC

is right;

is parallel to CD.

Therefore etc.

Q. E. D.


If anyone wishes to convince himself of the real necessity for some
general agreement as to the order in which propositions in elementary
geometry should be taken, let him contemplate the hopeless result of too
much independence on the part of editors in the matter of this proposition
and its converse, XI. 8.
Legendre adopts a different, and elegant, method of proof; but he applies
it to x i . 8, which he gives first, and then deduces XI. 6 from it by reductio ad
absurdum. D r Mehler uses Legendre's method of proof but applies it to
xi. 6, and then gives XI. 8 as a deduction from it. Lardner follows Legendre.
Holgate, the editor of a recent American book, gives Euclid's proof of XL 6
and deduces XI. 8 by reductio ad absurdum. H i s countrymen, Schultze and
Sevenoak, give XI. 8 first, but put it after, and deduce it from, Eucl. XI. 1 0 ;
they then give XI. 6, practically as a deduction from XI. 8 by reductio ad
absurdum, after a proposition corresponding to Eucl. x i . 11 and 12, and a
corollary to the effect that through a given point one and only one perpen­
dicular can be drawn to a given plane.
W e will now give the proof of XI. 6 by Legendre's method (adopted by
Smith and Bryant as well as by Mehler).
Let AB, CD be both perpendicular to the
C
A
same plane MN.
Join BD.
\ \ \
f
Now, since BD meets AB, CD, both of
\ \ \ ;'
which are perpendicular to the plane MN in
4
/
which BD is,
the angles ABD, CDB are right angles.
AB, CD will therefore be parallel provided
^ 1
IN
that they are in the same plane.
Through D draw EDF, in the plane MN,
at right angles to BD, and make ED equal to DF.
