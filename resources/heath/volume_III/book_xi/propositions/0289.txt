Join BE, BE, AE, AD, AE.
Then the triangles BDE, BDF are equal in all respects (by i. 4), so that
BE is equal to BE.
It follows, since the angles ABE, ABE axe right, that the triangles ABE,
ABE axe equal in all respects, and
AE is equal to AE.
[Mehler now argues elegantly thus. If CE, CE be also joined, it is clear
that
CE is equal to CF.
Hence each of the four points A, B, C, D is equidistant from the two
points E, F.
Therefore the points A , B , C , D are in one plane, so that AB, CD are
parallel.
If, however, we d o not use the locus of points equidistant from two fixed
points, we proceed as follows.]
T h e triangles AED, AFD have their sides equal respectively;
hence [1. 8] the angles ADE, ADFaxe equal,
so that ED is at right angles to AD.
Thus ED is at right angles to BD, AD, CD;
therefore CD is in the plane through AD, BD.
[xi. 5 ]
But AB is in that same plane;
[ x i . 2]
therefore AB, CD are in the same plane.
A n d the angles ABD, CDB are right;
therefore AB, CD are parallel.

PROPOSITION

7.

If two straight
lines be parallel
and points
be taken
random on each of them, the straight line joining
the points
in the same plane with the parallel
straight
lines.
Let AB,

at
is

CD be two parallel straight lines,

and let points E, F be taken at random
on them respectively ;

E
A

I say that the straight line joining the
points E, F is in the same plane with
the parallel straight lines.
For suppose it is not, but, if possible,
let it be in a more elevated plane as
EGF,
and let a plane be drawn through
it will then make, as
straight line.
