But in Book x i . it becomes a question whether there can be more than one
plane through parallel straight lines.
Simson goes on to say (2) " Besides, this 7th Proposition is demonstrated
by the preceding 3 r d ; in which the very same thing which is proposed to be
demonstrated in the 7th is twice assumed, viz., that the straight line drawn
from one point to another in a plane is in that plane." But there is nothing
in Prop. 3 about a plane in which two parallel straight lines a r e ; therefore
there is no assumption of the result of Prop. 7. What is assumed is that,
given two points in a plane, they can be joined by a straight line in the plane :
a legitimate assumption.
Lastly, says Simson, " A n d the same thing is assumed in the preceding
6th Prop, in which the straight line which joins the points B, D that are in
the plane to which AB and CD are at right angles is supposed to be in that
plane." Here again there is no question of a plane in which Into parallels are;
so that the criticism here, as with reference to Prop. 3, appears to rest on a
misapprehension.

PROPOSITION

8.

If two straight
lines be parallel,
and one of them be at
right angles to any plane, the remaining
one will also be at
right angles to the same
plane.
Let AB,

CD be two parallel straight lines,

and let one of them, AB,

be at right

angles to the plane of reference ;
I say that the remaining one, CD, will
also be at right angles

to the

same

plane.
For let AB,

CD meet the plane of

reference at the points B,
and let BD

therefore AB,
to

Let DE
BD,

let DE

CD, BD

are in one plane.

[xi. 7]

be drawn, in the plane of reference, at right angles

be made equal to

and let BE,

D,

be joined ;

AE,

AD

AB,

be joined.

Now, since AB is at right angles to the plane of reference,
therefore AB is also at right angles to all the straight lines
which meet it and are in the plane of reference ;
[ x i . Def. 3]
therefore each of the angles ABD, ABE
is right.
AB,

And, since the straight line BD
CD,

has fallen on the parallels
