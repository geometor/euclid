is also at right angles to the plane through

But the plane through DE,

DB

is the plane of reference;

therefore CD is at right angles to the plane of reference.
Therefore etc.
Q. E. D.


Simson objects to the words which explain why DC is in the plane through
BD, DA, viz. "inasmuch as AB, BD are in the plane through BD, DA, and
DC is also in the plane in which AB, BD are," as being too roundabout.
H e concludes that they are corrupt or interpolated, and that we ought only to
have the words " because all three are in the plane in which are the parallels
AB, CD" (by Prop. 7 preceding). B u t I think Euclid's words can be
defended. Prop. 7 says nothing of a plane determined by two transversals as
BD, DA are. Hence it is natural to say that DC is in the same plane in
which AB, BD are [Prop. 7], and AB, BD are in the same plane as BD,
DA [Prop. 2], so that DC is in the plane through BD, DA.
Legendre s alternative proof is split by him into two propositions.
(1) Let A B be a perpendicular to the plane M N and E F a line situated in that
plane ; if from B , the foot of the perpendicular, B D be drawn perpendicular to
E F , and A D be joined, I say that A D will be perpendicular to E F .
(2) If A B is perpendicular to the plane M N , every straight line C D parallel to
A B will be perpendicular to the same plane.
T o prove both propositions together we suppose CD given, join BD,
and draw EF perpendicular to BD in the
plane MN.

(1) A s before, we make DE equal to DF and
join BE, BF, AE, AF.
Then, since the angles BDE, BDF are
right, and DE, DF equal,
/ /
BE is equal to BF.

And, since AB is perpendicular to the
1
plane,
the angles ABE, ABE axe. both right.
Therefore, in the triangles ABE, ABE,
AE is equal to AF.
[1. 4]
Lastly, in the triangles ADE, ADF, since AE is equal to AF, and DE
to DF, while AD is common,
the angle ADE is equal to the angle ADF,
so that AD is perpendicular to EF.

[1. 8]

(2) ED being thus perpendicular to DA, and also (by construction)
perpendicular to DB,
ED is perpendicular to the plane ADB.
[ x i . 4]
But CD, being parallel to AB, is in the plane ABD;
therefore ED is perpendicular to CD.
