Also, since AB, CD are parallel,
and ABD is a right angle,
CDB is also a right angle.
T h u s CD is perpendicular to both DE and DB, and therefore to the
plane MN through DE, DB.

PROPOSITION

Straight
lines which are parallel to the same straight
line
and are not in the same plane with it are also parallel
to one
another.
For let each of the straight lines AB, CD be parallel to
EF, not being in the same plane
with it;
B
H
A
I say that AB

is parallel to CD.

For let a point G be taken at
F
random on EF,
and from it let there be drawn
GH, in the plane through EF,
AB,
at right angles to EF, and GK
EE, CD again at right angles to EF.
Now, since EF
lines GH,
GK,

E

in the plane through

is at right angles to each of the straight

therefore EF is also at right angles to the plane through
GH, GK.
[xi. 4]
And EF is parallel to AB;
therefore AB
HG, GK.

is also at right angles to the plane through
[xi. 8]

For the same reason
CD is also at right angles to the plane through HG,
GK;
therefore each of the straight lines AB, CD is at right angles
to the plane through HG,. GK.
But, if two straight lines be at right angles to the same
plane, the straight lines are parallel;
[xi. 6]
therefore AB is parallel to CD.
