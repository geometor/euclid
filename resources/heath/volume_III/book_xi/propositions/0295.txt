If two straight
lines meeting one another be parallel
to
two straight lines meeting one another not in the same
plane,
they will contain equal angles.
For let the two straight lines AB, BC meeting one
another be parallel to the two straight lines DE, EF meeting
one another, not in the same plane ;
I say that the angle ABC is equal to the angle DEF.

For let BA, BC, ED, EF be cut off equal to one another,
and let AD,

CF, BE,

Now, since BA

AC, DF be joined.

is equal and parallel to

ED,

therefore AD is also equal and parallel to BE.
[1. 33]
For the same reason
CF is also equal and parallel to BE.
Therefore each of the straight lines AD, CF is equal and
parallel to BE.
But straight lines which are parallel to the same straight
line and are not in the same plane with it are parallel to one
another;
[»• 9]
therefore AD is parallel and equal to CF.
And AC, DF')6\x\ them ;
therefore AC is also equal and,parallel to DF.
[1. 33]
Now, since the two sides AB,
sides DE,
EF,

BC are equal to the two

and the base AC is equal to the base DF,
therefore the angle ABC is equal to the angle DEF.
Therefore etc.
