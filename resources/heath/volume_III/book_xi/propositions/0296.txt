T h e result of this proposition does not appear to be quoted in Euclid until
x u . 3 ; but Euclid no doubt inserted it here advisedly, because it has the
effect of incidentally proving that the "inclination of two planes to one
another," as denned in XI. Def. 6, is one and the same angle at whatever
point of the common section the plane angle measuring it is drawn.

PROPOSITION

From a given elevated point
dicular to a given
plane.

II.

to draw a straight

line

perpen­

Let A be the given elevated point, and the plane of
reference the given plane;
thus it is required to draw from the
point A a straight line perpendicular to
A
the plane of reference.
Let any straight line BC be drawn,
at random, in the plane of reference,
and let AD be drawn from the p o i n t s
perpendicular to BC.
[i. 12]
If then AD is also perpendicular to
the plane of reference, that which was
enjoined will have been done.

But, if not, let DE be drawn from the point D at right
angles to BC and in the plane of reference,
[1. 1 1 ]
let AF be drawn from A perpendicular to DE,
[1. 12]
and let GH

be drawn through the point F parallel to BC.

Now, since BC is at right angles to each of the straight
lines DA,
DE,

And GH is parallel to it;
but, if two straight lines be parallel, and one of them be at
right angles to any plane, the remaining one will also be at
right angles to the same plane ;

therefore GH
