Therefore GH is also at right angles to all the straight
lines which meet it and are in the plane through ED,
DA.
[xi. Def. 3]
But AF

meets it and is in the plane through ED,

therefore GH is at right angles to
so that FA

is also at right angles to

GH.

also at right angles to

DE;

But AFis
therefore AF
GH,

DA ;

FA,

is at right angles to each of the straight lines

DE.
But, if a straight line be set up at right angles to two

straight lines which cut one another, at the point of section,
it will also be at right angles to the plane through them ; [xi. 4]
therefore FA

is at right angles to the plane through ED,

But the plane through ED,
therefore AFis

GH.

GH is the plane of reference ;

at right angles to the plane of reference.

Therefore from the given elevated point A the straight
line AF
has been drawn perpendicular to the plane of
reference.
Q. E. D.

T h e text-books differ in the form which they give to this proposition rather
than in substance. T h e y commonly assume the construction of a plane
through the point A at right angles to any straight line BC in the given plane
(the construction being effected in the manner shown at the end of the note
on x i . 5 above). T h e advantage of this method is that it enables a
perpendicular to be drawn from a point in the plane also, by the same
construction. (Where the letters for the two figures differ, those referring to
the second figure are put in brackets.)

W e can include the construction of the plane through A perpendicular to
BC, and make the whole into one proposition, thus.
BC being any straight line in the given plane MN, draw AD perpendicu­
lar to BC.
In any plane passing through BC but not through A draw DE at right
angles to BC.
Through DA, DE draw a plane; this will intersect the given plane MN
in a straight line, as FD (AD).
In the plane AG draw AHperpendicular
to FG (AD).
T h e n AH is the perpendicular required.
