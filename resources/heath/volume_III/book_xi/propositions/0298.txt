In the plane MN, through H in the first figure and A in the second, draw
KL parallel to BC.
Now, since BC is perpendicular to both DA and DE, BC is perpendicular
to the plane AG.
[xi. 4]
Therefore KL, being parallel to BC, is also perpendicular to the plane
AG [xi..8], and therefore to AH which meets it and is in that plane.
Therefore AH is perpendicular to both FD (AD) and KL at their point
of intersection.
Therefore AH is perpendicular to the plane MN.
T h u s we have solved the problem in XL 12 as well as that in XI. 11 ; and
this direct method of drawing a perpendicular to a plane from a point in it is
obviously preferable to Euclid's method by which the construction of a
perpendicular to a plane from a point without it is assumed, and a line is
merely drawn from a point in the plane parallel to the perpendicular obtained
in xi. 1 1 .

given plane

Let the plane of reference be the given plane,
and A

the point in it;

thus it is required to set up from the point
A a straight line at right angles to the
plane of reference.
Let any elevated point B be conceived,
from B let BC be drawn perpendicular to
the plane of reference,

[xi. n]

and through the point A let AD

be drawn

parallel to BC.

[1. 3 1 ]

Then, since AD,
CB are two parallel straight lines,
while one of them, BC, is at right angles to the plane of
reference,
therefore the remaining one, AD,
the plane of reference.
Therefore AD

is also at right angles to
