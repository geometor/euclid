PROPOSITION

13.

From the same point two straight lines cannot
right angles to the same plane on the same side.

be set up at

For, if possible, from the same point A let the two straight
lines AB,
AC
be set up at right
angles to the plane of reference and on
the same side,
and let a plane be drawn through
AC;

BA,

it will then make, as section through A
in the plane of reference, a straight line.
[xi-

Let it make

3]

DAE;

therefore the stfaight lines AB,

AC, DAE

are in one plane.

And, since CA is at right angles to the plane of reference,
it will also make right angles with all the straight lines which
meet it and are in the plane of reference.
[xi. Def. 3]
But DAE
meets it and is in the plane of reference ;
therefore the angle CAE

is right.

t or the same reason
the angle BAE

is also right;

therefore the angle CAE

is equal to the angle

BAE.

And they are in one plane :
which is impossible.
Therefore etc.
Q. E. D.


Simson added words to this as follows:
" Also, from a point above a plane there can be but one perpendicular to
that plane; for, if there could be two, they would be parallel to one another
[xi. 6], which is absurd."
Euclid does not give this result, but we have already had it in the note
above to x i . 4 (adfin.).
