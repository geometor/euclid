If two straight lines meeting one another be parallel to two
straight lines meeting one another, not being in the same plane,
the planes through them are parallel.
For let the two straight lines AB,
be parallel to the two straight lines
DE, EF meeting one another, not
being in the same plane ;
I say that the planes produced
through AB, BC and DE,
EFwW
not meet one another.

BC meeting one another

For let BG be drawn from the
point B perpendicular to the plane
through DE, EF[xi.
n ] , and let it
meet the plane at the point G;
through G let GH be drawn
parallel to ED, and GK parallel to EF.
[1. 31]
Now, since BG is at right angles to the plane through
DE,
EF,
therefore it will also make right angles with all the straight
lines which meet it and are in the plane through DE,
EF.
[xi. Def. 3]

But each of the straight lines GH, GK meets it and is in
the plane through DE,
EF;
therefore each of the angles BGH, BGK is right.
And, since BA

is parallel to GH,

therefore the angles GBA,

BGH

[xi. 9]

are equal to two right angles.
[1. 29]

But the angle BGH is right;
therefore the angle GBA is also right;
therefore GB is at right angles to BA.
GB

For the same reason
is also at right angles to BC.

Since then the straight line GB is set up at right angles
to the two straight lines BA, BC which cut one another,
therefore GB is also at right angles to the plane through
BA, BC.
