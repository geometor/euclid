For let the two parallel planes AB, CD be cut by the
plane
EFGH,
and let EF, GH be their common sections ;
I say that EF is parallel to GH.

For, if not, EF, GH will, when produced, meet either in
the direction of F, H or of E, G.
Let them be produced, as in the direction of F, H, and
let them, first, meet at K.
Now, since EFK is in the plane AB,
therefore all the points on EFK are also in the plane

AB.
[XI. !]

But K is one of the points on the straight line
EFK;
therefore K is in the plane AB.
For the same reason
K is also irt the plane CD ;
therefore the planes AB, CD will meet when produced.
But they do not meet, because they are, by hypothesis,
parallel;
therefore the straight lines EF, GH will not meet when
produced in the direction of F, H.
Similarly we can prove that neither will the straight lines
EF, GH meet when produced in the direction of E, G.
But straight lines which do not meet in either direction
are parallel.
[i. Def. 23]
Therefore EF is parallel to GH.
Therefore etc.
