Simson points out that, in here quoting 1. Oef. 23, Euclid should have
said " But straight lines in one plane which do not meet in either direction are
parallel."
From this proposition is deduced the converse of x i . 14.
If a straight line is perpendicular to one of two parallel planes, it is
perpendicular to the other also.
For suppose that MN, PQ are two parallel planes, and that AB is perpen­
dicular to MN.
Through AB draw any plane, and let it intersect
the planes MN, PQ in A C, BD respectively.
Therefore AC, BD are parallel.
[xi. 16]
But A C is perpendicular to AB;
therefore AB is also perpendicular to BD.
That is, AB is perpendicular to any line in PQ
passing through B;
therefore AB is perpendicular to PQ.
It follows as a corollary that
Through a given point one plane, and only one, can be draicn parallel to a
given plane.
In the above figure let A be the given point and PQ the given plane.
Draw AB perpendicular to PQ.
Through A draw a plane MN at right angles to AB (see note on x i . 5
above).
Then MN is parallel to PQ.
[xi. 14]
If there could pass through A a second plane parallel to PQ, AB would
also be perpendicular to it.
That is, AB would be perpendicular to two different planes through A :
which is impossible (see the same note).
Also it is readily proved that,
If two planes are parallel to a third plane, they are parallel to one another.
PROPOSITION 

1 7 .

If two straight lines be cut by parallel planes, they will be
cut in the same ratios.
For let the two straight
lines AB, CD be cut by the
parallel planes GH, KL, MN
at the points A, E, B and C,
F,D;
I say that, as the straight line
AE is to EB, so is C ^ t o ED.
For let AC, BD, AD be
joined,
let AD meet the plane KL
at the point O,
and let EO, OF be joined.
