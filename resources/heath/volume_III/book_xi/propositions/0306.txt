Now, since the two parallel planes KL, MN
the plane EBDO,
their common sections EO, BD are parallel.

are cut by
[xi. 16]

For the same reason, since the two parallel planes GH,
KL are cut by the plane A OFC,
their common sections AC, OF are parallel.
[id.}
And, since the straight line EO has been drawn parallel to
BD, one of the sides of the triangle ABD,
therefore, proportionally, as AE is to EB, so is AO to OD.
[vi. 2]

Again, since the straight line OF has been drawn parallel
to AC, one of the sides of the triangle ADC,
proportionally, as AO is to OD, so is CF to FD.
[id.]
But it was also proved that, as AO is to OD, so is AE
to

EB;

therefore also, as AE

is to EB, so is CF to FD.

Therefore etc.

If a straight line be at right angles to any plane, all the
planes through it will also be at right angles to the same plane.
For let any straight line AB be at right angles to the
plane of reference;
I say that all the planes through
AB are also at right angles to the
plane of reference.
For let the plane DE be drawn
through AB,
let CE be the common section of
the plane DE and the plane of
reference,
let a point F'be taken at random on CE,
and from F let EG be drawn in the plane DE at right
angles to CE.
[1. n ]
Now, since AB is at right angles to the plane of reference,
