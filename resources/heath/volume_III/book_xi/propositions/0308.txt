T h e n ABF is the angle which Euclid calls (in the case where it is acute)
the " inclination of the plane to the plane."

But, since AB is perpendicular to the plane MN, it is perpendicular to
BFin it.
Therefore the angle ABF is a right angle ;
whence the plane CE is perpendicular to the plane MN

PROPOSITION

19.

If two planes which cut one another be at right angles to
any plane, their common section will also be at right angles to
the same plane.
For let the two planes AB, BC be at right angles to the
plane of reference,
and let BD be their common section ;
I say that BD is at right angles to the
plane of reference.
For suppose it is not, and from the
point D let DE be drawn in the plane
AB at right angles to the straight line
AD, and DE in the plane BC at right
angles to CD.
Now, since the plane AB is at right
angles to the plane of reference,
and DE has been drawn in the plane AB at right angles to
AD, their common section,
therefore DE is at right angles to the plane of reference.
