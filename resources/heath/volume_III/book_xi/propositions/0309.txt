Similarly we can prove that
DF is also at right angles to the plane of reference.
Therefore from the same point D two straight lines have
been set up at right angles to the plane of reference on the
same side :
which is impossible.
[xi. 13]
Therefore no straight line except the common section DB
of the planes AB, BC can be set up from the point D at right
angles to the plane of reference.
Therefore etc.
Q. E. D.


Legendre, followed by other writers already quoted, uses a preliminary
proposition equivalent to Euolid's definition of planes at right angles to one
another.
If two planes are perpendicular to one another, a straight line drawn in one
of them perpendicular to their common section will be perpendicular to the other.
Let the perpendicular planes CE, MN (figure of last note) intersect in
CD, and let AB be drawn in CE perpendicular to CD.
In the plane MN draw BE at right angles to CD.
Then, since the planes are perpendicular, the angle ABE (their inclination)
is a right angle.
Therefore AB is perpendicular to both CD and BE, and therefore to the
plane MN.
We are now in a position to prove xi. 19, viz. If two planes be perpendicular
to a third, their intersection is also perpen­
dicular to that third plane.
Let each of the two planes AC, AD
intersecting in AB be perpendicular to the
plane MN.
Let A C, AD intersect MN in BC, BD
respectively.
In the plane MN draw BE at right
angles to BC and BE at right angles to
BD.
Now, since the planes AC, MN axe at
right angles, and BE is drawn in the latter perpendicular to BC, BE is
perpendicular to the plane AC.
Hence AB is perpendicular to BE.
[xi. 4]
Similarly AB is perpendicular to BE.
Therefore AB is perpendicular to the plane through BE, BE, i.e. to the
plane MN.
A n useful problem is that of drawing a common perpendicular to two
straight lines not in one plane, and in connexion with this the following
proposition may be given.
