Given a plane and a straight line not perpendicular to it, one plane, and only
one, can be drawn through the straight line perpen­
dicular to the plane.
Let AB be the given straight line, MN the
given plane.
From any point C in AB draw CD perpen­
dicular to the plane MN.
Through AB and CD draw a plane AE.
T h e n the plane AE is perpendicular to the
plane MN.
[xi. 18]
If any other plane could be drawn through M
AB perpendicular to MN, the intersection AB of
the two planes perpendicular to MN would itself
[xi. 19]
be perpendicular to MN:
which contradicts the hypothesis.
To draw a common perpendicular to two straight lines not in the same plane.
Let AB, CD be the given straight lines.
Through CD draw the plane MN parallel to AB (Prop. 2 in note
to x i . 15).
Through AB draw the plane AF perpendicular to the plane MN(see the
last preceding proposition).

Let the planes AF, MN intersect in EE, and let EF meet CD in G.
Frorr. G, in the plane AF, draw GHzX. right angles to EF, meeting AB in H.
GH is then the required perpendicular.
For AB is parallel to EF (Prop. 4 in note to x i . 1 5 ) ; therefore GH,
being perpendicular to EF, is also perpendicular to AB.
But, the plane AF being perpendicular to the plane MN, and GH being
perpendicular to EF, their intersection,
GH is perpendicular to the plane MN, and therefore to CD.
Therefore GH is perpendicular to both AB and CD.
Only one common perpendicular can be drawn to two straight lines not in
one plane.
For, if possible, let KL also be perpendicular to both AB and CD.
Let the plane through KL, AB meet the plane MN'in LQ.
T h e n AB is parallel to LQ (Prop. 4 in note to x i . 15), so that KL, being
perpendicular to AB, is also perpendicular to LQ.
Therefore KL is perpendicular to both CL and LQ, and consequently to
the plane MN.
But, if KP be drawn in the plane AF perpendicular to EF, KP is also
perpendicular to the plane MN.
