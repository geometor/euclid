Thus there are two perpendiculars from the point K to the plane
which is impossible.

Rausenberger's construction for the same problem is more elegant. Draw,
he says, through each straight line a plane parallel
to the other. Then draw through each straight line
a plane perpendicular to the plane through the
other. T h e two planes last drawn will intersect
in a straight line, and this straight line is the
common perpendicular required.
T h e form of the construction best suited for
examination purposes, because the most selfcontained, is doubtless that given by Smith and
Bryant.
Let AB, CD be the two given straight lines.
Through any point E in CD draw EF parallel to AB.
From any point G in AB draw GH perpendicular to the plane CDF,
meeting the plane in H.
Through H in the plane CDF draw
HK parallel to EE or AB, to cut CD
in K.
Then, since AB, HK are parallel,
AGHK is a plane.
Complete the parallelogram GHKL.
Now, since LK, GH are parallel, and
GH is perpendicular to the plane CDF,
LK is perpendicular to the plane
CDF.
Therefore LK is perpendicular to CD and KH, and therefore to AB which
is parallel to KH.

If a solid angle be contained by three plane angles, any two,
taken together in any manner, are greater than the remaining
one.
For let the solid angle at A be contained by the three
plane angles BAC, CAD, DAB;
I say that any two of the angles
BAC, CAD, DAB, taken to­
gether in any manner, are greater
than the remaining one.
If now the angles BAC, CAD,
DAB are equal to one another,
it is manifest that any two are greater than the remaining one.
But, if not, let BA C be greater,
and on the straight line AB, and at the point A on it, let the
