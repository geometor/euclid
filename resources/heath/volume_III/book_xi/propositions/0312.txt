angle BAE be constructed, in the plane through BA, AC,
equal to the angle DAB ;
let AE be made equal to AD,
and let BEC, drawn across through the point E, cut the
straight lines AB, AC at the points B, C;
let DB, DC be joined.
Now, since DA is equal to AE,
and AB is common,
two sides are equal to two sides ;
and the angle DAB is equal to the angle BAE;
therefore the base DB is equal to the base BE.

[i. 4]

And, since the two sides BD, DC are greater than BC,
[1. 20]

and of these DB was proved equal to BE,
therefore the remainder DC is greater than the remainder EC.
Now, since DA is equal to AE,
and AC is common,
and the base DC is greater than the base EC,
therefore the angle DA C is greater than the angle EA C.
L>- *5]

But the angle DAB

was also proved equal to the angle

BAE;
therefore the angles DAB,

DAC

are greater than the angle

BAC.
Similarly we can prove that the remaining angles also,
taken together two and two, are greater than the remaining
one.
Therefore etc.
Q. E. D.


After excluding the obvious case in which all three angles are equal,
Euclid goes on to say " If not, let the angle BA C be greater," without adding
greater than what. Heiberg is clearly right in saying that he means greater
than BAD, i.e. greater than one of the adjacent angles. This is proved by
the words at the end "Similarly we can prove," etc. Euclid thus excludes
as obvious the case where one of the three angles is not greater than either of
the other two, but proves the remaining cases. This is scientific, but he might
further have excluded as obvious the case in which one angle is greater than
one of the others but equal to or less than the remaining one.
