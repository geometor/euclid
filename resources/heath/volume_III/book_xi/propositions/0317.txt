which two, taken together in any manner, are greater than
the remaining one, namely
the angles ABC, DEF greater than the angle GHK,
the angles DEF, GHK greater than the angle ABC,
and, further, the angles GHK, ABC greater than the angle

DEF;
let the straight lines AB, BC, DE, EF, GH, HK be equal,
and let AC, DF, GK be joined ;
I say that it is possible to construct a triangle out of straight
lines equal to AC, DF, GK, that is, that any two of the
straight lines AC, DF, GK are greater than the remaining
one.
H

Now, if tire angles ABC, DEF, GHK are equal to one
another, it is manifest that, AC, DF, GK being equal also,
it is possible to construct a triangle out of straight lines equal
to AC, DF, GK.
But, if not, let them be unequal,
and on the straight line HK, and at the point H on it, let
the angle KHL be constructed equal
to the angle ABC;
let HL be made equal to one of the
straight lines AB, BC, DE, EF, GH,

HK,
and let KL, GL be joined.
Now, since the two sides AB, BC
are equal to the two sides KH,
HL,
and the angle at B is equal to the angle KHL,
therefore the base AC is equal to the base KL.
[1. 4]
And, since the angles ABC, GHK are greater than the
angle DEF,
