Let the angles ABC, DEF, GHK be the three given
plane angles, and let two of these, taken together in any
manner, be greater than the remaining one, while, further,
the three are less than four right angles;
thus it is required to construct a solid angle out of angles
equal to the angles ABC, DEF,
GHK.

Let AB, BC, DE, EF, GH, HK be cut off equal to one
another,
and let AC, DF, GK be joined ;
it is therefore possible to construct a triangle out of straight
lines equal to AC, DE, GK.
[xi. 22]
Let LMN be so constructed that
AC is equal to LM, DF to MN, and
further GK to NL,
let the circle LMN be described about
the triangle LMN,
let its centre be taken, and let it be 0;
let LO, MO, NO be joined ;
I say that AB is greater than LO.
For, if not, AB is either equal to LO, or less.
First, let it be equal.
Then, since AB is equal to LO,
while AB is equal to BC, and OL to OM,
the two sides AB, BC are equal to the two sides LO, OM
respectively;
and, by hypothesis, the base AC is equal to the base LM;
therefore the angle ABC is equal to the angle LOM.
[1. 8]
For the same reason
the angle DEF is also equal to the angle MON,
and further the angle GHK to the angle NOL ;
