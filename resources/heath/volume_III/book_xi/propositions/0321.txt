But they are also equal to four right angles :
which is absurd.
Therefore AB is not less than LO.
And it was proved that neither is it equal;
therefore AB is greater than LO.
Let then OR be set up from the point O at right angles
to the plane of the circle LMN,
[xi. 12]
and let the square on OR be equal to that area by which
the square on AB is greater than the square on LO; [Lemma]
let RL, RM, RN be joined.
Then, since RO is at right angles to the plane of the circle

LMN,
therefore RO is also at right angles to each of the straight
lines LO, MO, NO.
And, since LO is equal to OM,
while OR is common and at right angles,
therefore the base RL is equal to the base RM.
[1. 4]
For the same reason
RN is also equal to each of the straight lines RL,
RM;
therefore the three straight lines RL, RM, RN are equal to
one another.
Next, since by hypothesis the square on OR is equal to
that area by which the square on AB is greater than the
square on LO,
therefore the square on AB is equal to the squares on LO, OR.
But the square on LR is equal to the squares on L 0, OR,
for the angle LOR is right;
[1. 47]
therefore the square on AB is equal to the square on RL ;
therefore AB is equal to RL.
But each of the straight lines BC, DE, EE, GLI, HK is
equal to AB,
while each of the straight lines RM, RN is equal to RL ;
therefore each of the straight lines AB, BC, DE, EF, GH,
HK is equal to each of the straight lines RL, RM, RN.
