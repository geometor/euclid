And, since the two sides LR, RM are equal to the two
sides AB, BC,
and the base LM is by hypothesis equal to the base AC,
therefore the angle LRM is equal to the angle ABC.
[1. 8]
For the same reason
the angle MRN is also equal to the angle
and the angle LRN to the angle GHK.

DEF,

Therefore, out of the three plane angles LRM,
MRN,
LRN, which are equal to the three given angles ABC,
DEF,
GHK, the solid angle at R has been constructed, which is
contained by the angles LRM, MRN,
LRN.
Q. E. D.


LEMMA.

But how it is possible to take the square on OR equal to
that area by which the square on AB is
greater than the square on LO, we can show
c
as follows.
Let the straight lines AB, LO be
set out,
and let AB be the greater;
let the semicircle ABC be described on AB,
and into the semicircle ABC let AC be fitted equal to the
straight line L 0, not being greater than the diameter AB; [iv. 1]
let CB be joined
Since then the angle ACB is an angle in the semicircle

ACB,
therefore the angle ACB is right.
[m. 31]
Therefore the square on AB is equal to the squares on
AC,

CB.

[1.47]

Hence the square on AB is greater than the square on
AC by the square on CB.
But A C is equal to L 0.
Therefore the square on AB is greater than the square on
LO by the square on CB.
If then we cut off OR equal to BC, the square on AB will
be greater than the square on L O by the square on OR.
Q. E. D.


T h e whole difficulty in this proposition is the proof of a fact which makes
the construction possible, viz. the fact that, if LMAlbe a triangle with sides
