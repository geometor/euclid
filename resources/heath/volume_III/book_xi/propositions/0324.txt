Suppose that AB < LO.
Make OP, OQ (measured along OL, OM) each equal to
Thus, OL, OM being equal also, it follows that
PQ
is || to LM.
Hence
LM: PQ = LO : OF;
and, since LO > OP,

i.e. AC,

Thus, in A s POQ,

therefore

two sides are equal to two sides, and base

Suppose, if possible, that AB = LO.
Then (AB + BC), or (DE + EF) = MO + OL

which contradicts the hypothesis.

impossible; for in this case it would result that

Suppose, if possible, that AB = LO.
Then, in the triangles ABC, LOM, two sides AB,
equal to two sides LO, OM, and the bases

therefore

Similarly L. GHK - L NOL.
Therefore, by addition,

But, in the triangles DEF, MON, which

But it was proved that u MON>
