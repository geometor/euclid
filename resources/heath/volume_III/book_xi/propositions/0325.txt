Then LM, PQ are parallel, and

Thus, in the triangles ABC, POQ,

which contradicts the hypothesis.
Simson gives rather different proofs for all three cases; but the essence of

Case I.

(1)

Let AB be, if possible, equal to LO.
Then the A s ABC, DEF, GHK must be identically equal to the A s
LOM, MON, NOL respectively.

Therefore the vertical angles at O in the
latter triangles are equal respectively to the angles
at

B,E,H.

The latter are therefore together equal to four
right angles:
which is impossible.
(2) If AB be less than LO, construct on the
bases LM, MN, NL triangles with vertices
P, Q, R and identically equal to the A s ABC,
DEF,
GHK respectively.
