Then P, Q, R will fall within the respective angles at O, since PL = PM
and < LO, and similarly in the other cases.
T h u s [1. 21] the angles at P, Q, R are respectively greater than the angles
at O in which they lie.
Therefore the sum of the angles at P, Q, R, i.e. the sum of the angles at
B, E, H, is greater than four right angles:
which again contradicts the hypothesis.
Case II.

(O lying on

MN.)

In this case, whether (1) AB = LO, or (2) AB < LO, a triangle cannot
be formed with MN as base and each of the other sides equal to AB. In other
words, the triangle DEE either reduces to a straight line or is impossible.

Case III.
(1)

(O lying outside the A

LMN.)

Suppose, if possible, that AB = LO.

Then the triangles LOM, MON,
triangles ABC, DEE,
GHK.
Since

NOL

are identically equal to the

LLOM+LLON=L
L ABC

MON,

* L GHK=

L

DEE:

which contradicts the hypothesis.
(2)

Suppose that

AB < OL.

Draw, as before, on LM, MN, NL as bases triangles with vertices P, Q, R
and identically equal to the A s ABC, DEE,
GHK.
Next, at N on the straight line NR, make L RNS equal to the angle
PLM,
cut off NS equal to LM and join RS, LS.
T h e n A NRS is identically equal to A LPM or A ABC.
Now

that is,

(LLNR

+ LRNS)<{LNLO

L. LNS

< L

+

I-OLM),

NLM.

Thus, in A s LNS, NLM, two sides are equal to two sides, and the included
angle in the former is less than the included angle in the other.
Therefore

LS < MN.
