PROPOSITION

24.

If a solid be contained by parallel planes, the opposite planes
in it are equal andparallelogrammic.
For let the solid CDHG be contained by the parallel planes
AC, GF, AH, DF, BF,
AE;
I say that the opposite planes
in it are equal and parallelo­
grammic.
For, since the two parallel
planes BG, CE are cut by the
plane A C,
their common sections are
parallel.
