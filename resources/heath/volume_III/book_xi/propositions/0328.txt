Therefore AB is parallel to DC.
Again, since the two parallel planes BF, AE are cut by
the plane AC,
their common sections are parallel.
[xi. 16]
Therefore BC is parallel to AD.
But AB was also proved parallel to DC;
therefore AC is a parallelogram.
Similarly we can prove that each of the planes DF, FG,
GB, BF, AE is a parallelogram.
Let AH, DF be joined.
Then, since AB is parallel to DC, and BH to CF,
the two straight lines AB, BH which meet one another are
parallel to the two straight lines DC, CF which meet one
another, not in the same plane ;
therefore they will contain equal angles;
[xi. 10]
therefore the angle ABH is equal to the angle DCF.
And, since the two sides AB, BH are equal to the two
sides DC, CF,
[1. 34]
and the angle ABH is equal to the angle DCF,
therefore the base AH is equal to the base DF,
and the triangle ABH is equal to the triangle DCF.
[1. 4]
And the parallelogram BG is double of the triangle ABH,
and the parallelogram CE double of the triangle DCF; [1. 34]
therefore the parallelogram BG is equal to the parallelo­
gram CE.
Similarly we can prove that
AC is also equal to GF,
and AE to BF.
Therefore etc.
Q. E. D.

A s Heiberg says, this proposition is carelessly enunciated. Euclid means
a solid contained by six planes and not more, the planes are parallel two and
two, and the opposite faces are equal in the sense of identically equal, or, as
Simson puts it, equal and similar. T h e similarity is necessary in order to
enable the equality of the parallelepipeds in the next proposition to be inferred
from the 10th definition of Book x i . Hence a better enunciation would be:
If a solid be contained by six planes parallel two and two, the opposite faces
respectively are equal and simitar parallelograms.
T h e proof is simple and requires no elucidation.
