PROPOSITION 

2 5 .

If a parallelepipedal solid be cut by a plane which is
parallel to the opposite planes, then, as the base is to the base, so
will the solid be to the solid.
For let the parallelepipedal solid ABCD be cut by the
plane FG which is parallel to the opposite planes RA, DH;
I say that, as the base A EFV is to the base EHCF, so is the
solid ABFU to the solid EGCD.

For let AH be produced in each direction,
let any number of straight lines whatever, AK, KL, be made
equal to AE,
and any number whatever, HM, MN, equal to EH;
and let the parallelograms LP, KV, HW, MS and the solids
LQ, KR, DM, MTbe completed.
Then, since the straight lines LK, KA, AE are equal to
one another,
the parallelograms LP, KV, AF are also equal to one another,
KO, KB, A G are equal to one another,
and further LX, KQ, AR are equal to one another, for they
are opposite.
[xi. 24]
For the same reason
the parallelograms EC, HW, MS are also equal to one another,
HG, HI, IN are equal to one another,
and further DH, MY, NT are equal to one another.
Therefore in the solids LQ, KR, A U three planes are
equal to three planes.
