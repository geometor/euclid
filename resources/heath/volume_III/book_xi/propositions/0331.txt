though it is true, where no solid angle in the figures is contained by more
than three plane angles, that two solid figures are equal and similar which are
contained by the same number of equal and similar faces, similarly arranged,
the fact should have been proved. T o do this, we hare only to prove the
proposition, given above in the note on XI. 21, that two trihedral angles are
equal if the three face angles of the one are respectively equal to the three face
angles in the other, and all are arranged in the same order, and then to prove
equality by applying one figure to the other as is done by Simson in his
proposition C.
Application will also, of course, establish what is assumed by Euclid of
the solids formed by the multiples of the original solids, namely that, if
LF> NF, the solid LU> the solid NU.

PROPOSITION

26.

On a given straight line, and at a given point on it, to
construct a solid angle equal to a given solid angle.
Let AB be the given straight line, A the given point on
it, and the angle at D, contained by the angles EDC,
EDF,
FDC, the given solid angle ;
thus it is required to construct on the straight line AB, and at
the point A on it, a solid angle equal to the solid angle at D.

For let a point F be taken at random on DF,
let FG be drawn from F perpendicular to the plane through
ED, DC, and let it meet the plane at G,
[xi. n ]
let DG be joined,
let there be constructed on the straight line AB and at the
point A on it the angle BAL equal to the angle EDC, and
the angle BAK equal to the angle EDG,
[1. 23]
let AK be made equal to DG,
