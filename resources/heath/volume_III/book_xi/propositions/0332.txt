let KH be set up from the point K at right angles to the
plane through BA, AL,
[xi. 12]
let KH be made equal to GF,
and let HA be joined ;
I say that the solid angle at A, contained by the angles BAL,
BAH, HAL
is equal to the solid angle at D contained by
the angles EDC, EDF,
EDC.
For let AB, DE be cut off equal to one another,
and let HB, KB, EE, GE be joined.
Then, since FG is at right angles to the plane of reference,
it will also make right angles with all the straight lines which
meet it and are in the plane of reference ;
[xi. Def. 3]
therefore each of the angles FGD, FGE is right.
For the same reason
each of the angles HKA, HKB is also right.
And, since the two sides KA, AB are equal to the two
sides GD, DE respectively,
and they contain equal angles,
therefore the base KB is equal to the base GE.
[1. 4]
But KH is also equal to GF,
and they contain right angles;
therefore HB is also equal to EE.
[1. 4]
Again, since the two sides AK, KH are equal to the two
sides DG, GE,
and they contain right angles,
therefore the base AH is equal to the base FD.
[1. 4]
But AB is also equal to DE ;
therefore the two sides HA, AB are equal to the two sides

DF, DE.
And the base HB is equal to the base EE;
therefore the angle BAH is equal tc the angle EDF.
For the same reason
the angle HA L is also equal to the angle FDC.
And the angle BAL

is also equal to the angle EDC.
