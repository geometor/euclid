Therefore on the straight line AB, and at the point A on
it, a solid angle has been constructed equal to the given solid
angle at D.
Q. E. D.

This proposition again assumes the equality of two trihedral angles which
have the three plane angles of the one respectively equal to the three plane
angles of the other taken in the same order.

PROPOSITION

27.

On a given straight line to describe a parallelepipedal solid
similar and similarly situated to a given parallelepipedal solid.
Let AB be the given straight line and CD the given
parallelepipedal solid;
thus it is required to describe on the given straight line AB
a parallelepipedal solid similar and similarly situated to the
given parallelepipedal solid CD.

For on the straight line AB and at the point A on it let
the solid angle, contained by the angles BAH, HAK,
KAB,
be constructed equal to the solid angle at C, so that the angle
BAH is equal to the angle ECF, the angle BAK equal to
the angle ECG, and the angle KAH to the angle GCE;
and let it be contrived that,
as EC is to CG, so is BA to AK,
and, as GC is to CF, so is KA to AH.
[vi 12]
Therefore also, ex aequali,
as EC is to CF, so is BA to AH.
[v. 22]
Let the parallelogram HB and the solid AL be completed.
Now since, as EC is to CG, so is BA to AK,
and the sides about the equal angles ECG, BAK
proportional,

are thus
