therefore the parallelogram GE is similar to the parallelo­
gram KB.
For the same reason
the parallelogram KH is also similar to the parallelogram GF,
and further FE to HB;
therefore three parallelograms of the solid CD are similar to
three parallelograms of the solid AL.
But the former three are both equal and similar to the
three opposite parallelograms,
and the latter three are both equal and similar to the three
opposite parallelograms;
therefore the whole solid CD is similar to the whole solid AL.
[xi. Def. 9]

Therefore on the given straight line AB there has been
described AL similar and similarly situated to the given
parallelepipedal solid CD.
Q. E. D.


PROPOSITION

28.

If a parallelepipedal solid be cut by a plane through the
diagonals of the opposite planes, the solid will be bisected by the
plane.
For let the parallelepipedal solid AB be cut by the plane
CDEF through the diagonals CF, DE of
opposite planes;
I say that the solid AB will be bisected by
the plane CDEF.
For, since the triangle CGF is equal
to the triangle CFB,
[1. 34]
and ADE to DEH,
while the parallelogram CA is also equal
to the parallelogram EB, for they are opposite,
and GE to CH,
therefore the prism contained by the two triangles CGF,
ADE and the three parallelograms GE, AC, CE is also equal
to the prism contained by the two triangles CFB, DEH and
the three parallelograms CH, BE, CE;
