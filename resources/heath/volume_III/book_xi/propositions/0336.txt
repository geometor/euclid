Since the lateral edges of a prism are parallel, CH will fall an CH , and
Z>A!" on .ZXA".
A n d the points E, G, L coincide respectively with E', G', L', so that
the planes GK, GK' coincide.
Hence H, K coincide with H', K' respectively.
Thus the prisms coincide throughout and are equal.
In the same way we can prove that two truncated prisms with three faces
forming a solid angle related to one another as in the above proposition are
identically equal.
In particular,
Cor.

Two right prisms having equal bases and equal heights are equal.

3. An oblique prism is equivalent to a right prism whose base is a right
section of the oblique prism and whose
height is equal to a lateral edge of the
oblique prism.
Suppose GL to be a right section of
the oblique prism AD, and let GL be
a right prism on GL as base and with
height equal to a lateral edge of AD.
Now the lateral edges of GL' axe
equal to the lateral edges of AD'.
Therefore AG = A'G',
BH=BH',
CK= C'K', etc.
Thus the faces AH, BK, CL are
equal respectively to the faces
A'If,
BK,
CL'.
Therefore
[by
the
- proposition
above]
(truncated prism AL) = (truncated
prism A'L').
Subtracting each from the whole solid AL', we see that
the prisms AD, GL' are equivalent.
