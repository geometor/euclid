Now suppose the parallelepiped of Euclid's proposition to be cut by the
plane through AG, DF.
Let KLMNbe a right section of the parallelepiped
cutting the edges AD, BC, GF, HE.
Then KLMN is a parallelogram; and, if the
diagonal KM be drawn,
A KZM= A MNK.
Now the prism of which the A s ABG, DCF are
the bases is equal to the right prism on AKLM as
base and of height AD.
Similarly the prism of which the A s AGH, DEE
are the bases is equal to the right prism on A MNK
as base and with height AD.
[(3) above]
A n d the right prisms on A s KLM, MNK as bases and of equal height
AD are equal.
[(2), Cor. above]
Consequently the two prisms into which the parallelepiped is divided are
equivalent.

PROPOSITION 

29.

Parallelepipedal solids which are on the same base and of
the same height, and in which the extremities of the sides which
stand up are on the same straight lines, are equal to one
another.
Let CM, CN be parallelepipedal solids on the same base
AB and of the same height,
and let the extremities of their
sides which stand up, namely
AG, AF, LM, LN, CD, CE,
BH,BK,be on the same straight
lines FN, DK;
I say that the solid CM is equal
to the solid CN.
For, since each of the figures
CH, CK is a parallelogram, CB
is equal to each of the straight lines DH, EK,
[1- 34]
hence DH is also equal to EK.
Let EH be subtracted from each ;
therefore the remainder DE is equal to the remainder HK.
Hence the triangle DCE is also equal to the triangle
HBK,
[1. 8, 4]
and the parallelogram DG to the parallelogram HN.
