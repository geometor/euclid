For the same reason
the triangle AFG is also equal to the triangle MLN.
But the parallelogram CE is equal to the parallelogram BM,
and CG to BN, for they are opposite ;
therefore the prism contained by the two triangles AFG, DCE
and the three parallelograms AD, DG, CG is equal to the
prism contained by the two triangles MLN, HBK and the
three parallelograms BM, HN,
BN.
Let there be added to each the solid of which the
parallelogram AB is the base and GEHM its opposite;
therefore the whole parallelepipedal solid CM is equal to the
whole parallelepipedal solid CN.
Therefore etc.
Q. E. D.


A s usual, Euclid takes one case only and leaves the reader to prove for
himself the two other possible cases shown in the subjoined figures. Euclid's
proof holds with a very slight change in each case. With the first figure, the

only difference is that the prism of which the A s GAL, ECB are the bases
takes the place of " t h e solid of which the parallelogram AB is the base and
GEHM its opposite"; while with the second figure we have to subtract the
prisms which are proved equal successively from the solid of which the
parallelogram AB is the base and FDKN its opposite.
Simson, as usual, suspects mutilation by " s o m e unskilful editor," but gives
a curious reason why the case in which the two parallelograms opposite to
AB have a side common ought not to have been omitted, namely that this
case "is immediately deduced from the preceding 28th Prop which seems for
this purpose to have been premised to the 29th." But, apart from the fact that
Euclid's Prop. 28 does not prove the theorem which it enunciates (as we have
seen), that theorem is not in the least necessary for the proof of this case of
Prop. 29, as Euclid's proof applies to it perfectly well.
PROPOSITION

30.

Parallelepipedal solids which are on the same base and of
the same height, and in which the extremities of the sides which
stand up are not on the same straight lines, are equal to one
another.
