Let CM, CN be parallelepipedal solids on the same base
AB and of the same height,
and let the extremities of their
sides which stand up, namely

AF, AG, LM, LN, CD, CE,
BH, BK, not be on the same
straight lines;
I say that the solid CM is
equal to the solid CN.
For let NK, DH be pro- 1
duced and meet one another
at J?,
and further let EM, GE be
produced to P, Q ;
let AO, LP, CQ, BR be joined.
Then the solid CM, of which the parallelogram ACBL is
the base, and FDHM its opposite, is equal to the solid CP,
of which the parallelogram A CBL is the base, and OQRP its
opposite ;
for they are on the same base A CBL and of the same height,
and the extremities of their sides which stand up, namely AE,
AO, LM, LP, CD, CQ, BH, BR, are on the same straight
lines FP, DR.
[xi. 29]
But the solid CP, of which the parallelogram ACBL is
the base, and OQRP its opposite, is equal to the solid CN,
of which the parallelogram A CBL is the base and GEKN its
opposite;
for they are again on the same base A CBL and of the same
height, and the extremities of their sides which stand up,
namely AG, AO, CE, CQ, LN, LP, BK, BR, are on the
same straight lines GQ, NR.
Hence the solid CM is also equal to the solid CN.
Therefore etc.
Q. E. D.


This proposition completes the proof of the theorem that
Two parallelepipeds on the same base and of the same height are equivalent.
Legendre deduced the useful theorem that
Every parallelepiped can be changed into an equivalent rectangular parallele­
piped having the same height and an equivalent base.
For suppose we have a parallelepiped on the base ABCD with EFGH for
the opposite face.
