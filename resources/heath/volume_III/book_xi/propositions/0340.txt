Draw AT, BK, CL, DM perpendicular to the plane through EFGH and
all equal to the height of the parallelepiped A G. Then, on joining IK, KL,
LM, MI, we have a parallelepiped equivalent to the original one and having
its lateral faces AK, BL, CM, DI rectangles.

If ABCD is not a rectangle, draw AO, DN'iw the plane AC perpendicu­
lar to BC, and IP, MQ in the plane IL perpendicular to KL.
Joining OP, NQ, we have a rectangular parallelepiped on AOND as base
which is equivalent to the parallelepiped with ABCD as base and IKLM as
opposite face, since we may regard these parallelepipeds as being on the same
base ADMI&nd of the same height (AO).
That is, a rectangular parallelepiped has been constructed which is
equivalent to the given parallelepiped and has (1) the same height, (2) an
equivalent base.
T h e American text-books which I have quoted adopt a somewhat different
construction shown in the subjoined figure.

T h e edges AB, DC, EF, HG of the original parallelepiped are produced
and cut at right angles by two parallel planes at a distance apart A'B equal
XoAB.
Thus a parallelepiped is formed in which all the faces are rectangles except
A'H', BG'.
