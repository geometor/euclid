Next produce I/A', CB, G'F, H'E and cut them perpendicularly by two
parallel planes at a distance apart B'C" equal to BC.
T h e points of section determine a rectangular parallelepiped.
T h e equivalence of the three parallelepipeds is proved, not by Eucl. x i .

the note to x i . 28 (3 in that note).

PROPOSITION 

3 1 .

Parallelepipedal solids which are on equal bases and of the
same height are equal to one another.
Let the parallelepipedal solids AE, CF, of the same height,
be on equal bases AB, CD.
I say that the solid AE is equal to the solid CF.

First, let the sides which stand up, HK, BE, AG, LM,
PQ, DE, CO, RS, be at right angles to the bases AB, CD;
let the straight line RT be produced in a straight line
with CR;
on the straight line RT, and at the point R on it, let the
angle TRUbe constructed equal to the angle ALB,
[1. 23]
let RTbe made equal to AL, and RU equal to LB,
and let the base RW zxid the solid XUbe completed.
Now, since the two sides TR, RU are equal to the two
sides AL, LB,
and they contain equal angles,
therefore the parallelogram RW is equal and similar to the
parallelogram HL.
Since again AL is equal to RT, and LM to RS,
and they contain right angles,
