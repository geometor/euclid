therefore the parallelogram RX is equal and similar to the
parallelogram AM.
•

For the same reason
LE is also equal and similar to SU;
therefore three parallelograms of the solid AE are equal and
similar to three parallelograms of the solid XU.
But the former three are equal and similar to the three
opposite, and the latter three to the three opposite;
[xi. 24]
therefore the whole parallelepipedal solid AE is equal to the
whole parallelepipedal solid XU.
[xi. Def. 10]
Let DR, WU be drawn through and meet one another
at Y,
let a Tb be drawn through T parallel to D Y,
let PD be produced to a,
and let the solids YX, RI be completed.
Then the solid XY, of which the parallelogram RX is the
base and Yc its opposite, is equal to the solid XU of which
the parallelogram RX is the base and U V its opposite,
for they are on the same base RX and of the same height, and
the extremities of their sides which stand up, namely RY, RU,
Tb, TW, Se, Sd, Xc, XV, are on the same straight lines

YW, eV.

[ x i . 29]

But the solid XU is equal to AE :
therefore the solid XY is also equal to the solid AE.
And, since the parallelogram RUWT
is equal to the
parallelogram YT
for they are on the same base RT and in the same parallels

RT, YW,

[1. 35]

while RUWT is equal to CD, since it is also equal to AB,
therefore the parallelogram YT is also equal to CD.
But DT is another parallelogram ;
therefore, as the base CD is to DT, so is YT to DT.
[v. 7]
And, since the parallelepipedal solid CI has been cut by
the plane RE which is parallel to opposite planes,
as the base CD is to the base DT, so is the solid CE to the
solid RI.
