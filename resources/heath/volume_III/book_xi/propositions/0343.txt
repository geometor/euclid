For the same reason,
since the parallelepipedal solid YI has been cut by the plane
RX which is parallel to opposite planes,
as the base YT is to the base TD, so is the solid YX to the
solid RI.
[xi. 25]
But, as the base CD is to DT, so is YT to DT;
therefore also, as the solid CF is to the solid RI, so is the
solid YX to RI.
[v. 11]
Therefore each of the solids CF, YX has to RI the same
ratio;
therefore the solid CF is equal to the solid YX.
[v. 9]
But YX was proved equal to AE;
therefore AE is also equal to CF.
Next, let the sides standing up, AG, HK, BE, LM, CN,
PQ, DF, RS, not be at right angles to the bases AB, CD;
I say again that the solid AE is equal to the solid CF.

For from the points K, E, G, M, Q, F, N, S let KO, ET,
GU, MV, QW, FX, NY, SI be drawn perpendicular to the
plane of reference, and let them meet the plane at the points

0, T, U, V, W, X, Y, I,
and let OT, OU, UV, TV, WX, WY, YI, IX be joined.
Then the solid KVis equal to the solid QI,
for they are on the equal bases KM, QS and of the same
height, and their sides which stand up are at right angles to
their bases.
[First part of this Prop.]
But the solid KV\s equal to the solid AE,
and QI to CF;
for they are on the same base and of the same height, while
the extremities of their sides which stand up are not on the
same straight lines.
