into the text. H e is correct in his remark that the words "while the
extremities of their sides which stand up are not on the same straight lines "
just before the end of the proposition would be better absent, since they may
be " on the same straight lines."
PROPOSITION

32.

Parallelepipedal solids which are of the same height are to
one another as their bases.
Let AB, CD be parallelepipedal solids of the same height;
I say that the parallelepipedal solids AB, CD are to one
another as their bases, that is, that, as the base AE is to the
base CF, so is the solid AB to the solid CD.

For let FH equal to AE be applied to FG,
[1. 45]
and on FH as base, and with the same height as that of CD,
let the parallelepipedal solid GK be completed.
Then the solid AB is equal to the solid GK;
for they are on equal bases AE, FH and of the same height.
[xi. 31]

And, since the parallelepipedal solid CK is cut by the plane
DG which is parallel to opposite planes,
therefore, as the base CF is to the base FH, so is the solid
CD to the solid DH.
[xi. 25]
But the base FH is equal to the base AE,
and the solid GK to the solid AB;
therefore also, as the base AE is to the base CF, so is the
solid AB to the solid CD.
Therefore etc.
Q. E. D.

A s Clavius observed, Euclid should have said, in applying the parallelo­
gram FH to FG, that it should be applied " in the angle F G H equal to the
angle L C G . " Simson is however, I think, hypercritical when he states as
regards the completion of the solid GK that it ought to be said, " complete
