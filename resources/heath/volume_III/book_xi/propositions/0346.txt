the solid of which the base is FH, and one of its insisting straight lines is FD."
Surely, when we have two faces DG, FH meeting in an edge, to say "complete
the solid" is quite sufficient, though the words " on FH as b a s e " might
perhaps as well be left out. T h e same " completion " of a parallelepipedal
solid occurs in x i . 31 and 33.

PROPOSITION 

3 3 .

Similar parallelepipedal solids are to one another in the
triplicate ratio of their corresponding sides.
Let AB, CD be similar parallelepipedal solids,
and let AE be the side corresponding to CF;
I say that the solid AB has to the solid CD the ratio triplicate
of that which AE has to CF.

For let EK, EL, EM be produced in a straight line with
AE, GE, HE,
let EK be made equal to CF, EL equal to FN, and further
EM equal to FR,
and let the parallelogram KL and the solid KP be completed.
Now, since the two sides KE, EL are equal to the two
sides CF, EN,
while the angle KEL is also equal to the angle CEN,
inasmuch as the angle AEG is also equal to the angle CEN
because of the similarity of the solids AB, CD,
