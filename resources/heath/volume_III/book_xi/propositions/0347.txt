therefore the parallelogram KL is equal < and similar > to the
parallelogram CN.
For the same reason
the parallelogram KM is also equal and similar to CR,
and further EP to DF;
therefore three parallelograms of the solid KP are equal and
similar to three parallelograms of the solid CD.
But the former three parallelograms are equal and similar
to their opposites, and the latter three to their opposites; [xi. 24]
therefore the whole solid KP is equal and similar to the whole
solid CD.
[xi. Def. 10]
Let the parallelogram GK be completed,
and on the parallelograms GK, KL as bases, and with the
same height as that of AB, let the solids EO, LQ be
completed.
Then since; owing to the similarity of the solids AB, CD,
as AE is to CF, so is EG to FN, and EH to FR,
while CF is equal to EK, FN to EL, and FR to EM,
therefore, as AE is to EK, so is GE to EL, and HE to EM.
But, as AE is to EK, so is A G to the parallelogram GK,
as GE is to EL, so is GK to KL,
and, as HE is to EM, so is QE to KM;
[vi. 1]
therefore also, as the parallelogram A G is to GK, so is (JA*
to KL, and g f f to A W .
But, as AG is to GK, so is the solid AB to the solid ^"(9,
as GK is to AX, so is the solid OE to the solid QL,
and, as QE is to A"¥, so is the solid QL to the solid KP;
[ x i . 32]

therefore also, as the solid AB is to .£"0, so is EO to £?Z, and
QL to A V > .
But, if four magnitudes be continuously proportional, the
first has to the fourth the ratio triplicate of that which it has
to the second;
[v. Def. 10]
therefore the solid AB has to KP the ratio triplicate of that
which AB has to EO.
But, as AB is to EO, so is the parallelogram AG to GK,
and the straight line AE to EK [vi. 1 ] ;
