Simson adds, as Prop. D , a useful theorem which we should have expected
to find here, on the analogy of v i . 23 following v i . 19, 20, viz. that Solid
parallelepipeds contained by parallelograms equiangular to one another, each to
each, that is, of which the solid angles are equal, each to each, have to one another
the ratio compounded of the ratios of their sides.
The proof follows the method of the proposition x i . 33, and we can use
the same figure. In order to obtain one ratio between lines to represent the
ratio compounded of the ratios of the sides, after the manner of vi. 23, we
take any straight line a, and then determine three other straight lines b, c, d,
such that
AE : CF=a: b,
EG : FN= b : c,
EH: FR = c:d,
whence a : d represents the ratio compounded of the ratios of the sides.
We obtain, in the same manner as above,
(solid AB): (solid EO) = CJAG;CJ
GK= AE : EK= AE : CF
= a:b,
(solid EO) : (solid QL) = O GE: CJ KL = GE : EL = GE : FN
= b:c,
(solid QL) : (solid KP) » O H K - . C J KM= EH: EM= EH: FR
= c:d,
whence, by composition [v. 22],
(solid AB): (solid KP) = a:d,
or
(solid AB): (solid CD) =a:d.
PROPOSITION 

3 4 .

In equal parallelepipedal solids the bases are reciprocally
proportional to the heights; and those parallelepipedal solids in
which the bases are reciprocally proportional to the heights are
equal.
Let AB, CD be equal parallelepipedal solids ;
I say that in the parallelepipedal solids AB, CD the bases are
reciprocally proportional to the heights,
that is, as the base EH is to the base NQ, so is the height
of the solid CD to the height of the solid AB.
First, let the sides which stand up, namely AG, EE, LB,
HK, CM, NO, PD, QR, be at right angles to their bases ;
I say that, as the base EH is to the base NQ, so is CM
to AG.
If now the base EH is equal to the base NQ,
while the solid AB is also equal to the solid CD,
CM will also be equal to AG.
