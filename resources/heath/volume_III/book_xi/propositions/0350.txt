For parallelepipedal solids of the same height are to
one another as the bases ;
[xi. 32]
and, as the base EH is to NQ, so will CM be to AG,
and it is manifest that in the parallelepipedal solids AB, CD
the bases are reciprocally proportional to the heights.
Next, let the base EH not be equal to the base NQ,
but let EH be greater.

Now the solid AB is equal to the solid CD ;
therefore CM is also greater than A G.
Let then C7"be made equal to AG,
and let the parallelepipedal solid VC be completed on NQ as
base and with CT'as height.
Now, since the solid AB is equal to the solid CD,
and CV'is outside them,
while equals have to the same the same ratio,
[v. 7]
therefore, as the solid AB is to the solid CV, so is the solid
CD to the solid CV.
But, as the solid AB is to the solid CV, so is the base
EH to the base NQ,
for the solids AB, CV are of equal height;
[xi. 32]
and, as the solid CD is to the solid C V, so is the base MQ to
the base TQ [xi. 25] and CM to CT [vi. 1 ] ;
therefore also, as the base EH is to the base NQ, so is MC
to CT.
But CT is equal to AG ;
therefore also, as the base EH is to the base NQ, so is MC
to AG.
