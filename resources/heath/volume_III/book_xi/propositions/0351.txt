Therefore in the parallelepipedal solids AB, CD the bases
are reciprocally proportional to the heights.
Again, in the parallelepipedal solids AB CD let the bases
be reciprocally proportional to the heights, chat is, as the base
EH is to the base NQ, so let the height of the solid CD be
to the height of the solid AB ;
I say that the solid AB is equal to the solid CD.
Let the sides which stand up be again at right angles to
the bases.
Now, if the base EH is equal to the base NQ,
and, as the base EH is to the base NQ, so is the height of
the solid CD to the height of the solid AB,
therefore the height of the solid CD is also equal to the
height of the solid AB.
But parallelepipedal solids on equal bases and of the same
height are equal to one another ;
[xi. 31]
therefore the solid AB is equal to the solid CD.
Next, let the base EH not be equal to the base NQ,
but let EH be greater ;
therefore the height of the solid CD is also greater than the
height of the solid AB,
that is, CM is greater than A G.
Let CT be again made equal to AG,
and let the solid CVbe similarly completed.
Since, as the base EH is to the base NQ, so is MC

to AG,
while AG is equal to CT,
therefore, as the base EH

is to the base NQ,

so is CM

to CT.
But, as the base EH is to the base NQ, so is the solid
AB to the solid CV,
for the solids AB, CV are of equal height;
[x 52]
and, as CM is to CT, so is the base MQ to the base QT [vi. 1]
and the solid CD to the solid CV.
[xi. 25]
Therefore also, as the solid AB is to the solid CV, so is
the solid CD to the solid CV;
therefore each of the solids AB, CD has to CV the same
ratio.
