Therefore the solid AB is equal to the solid CD.

[v. 9]

Now let the sides which stand up, FE, BL, GA, HK,
ON, DP, MC, RQ, not be at right angles to their bases ;
let perpendiculars be drawn from the points F, G, B, K, 0,
M, D, R to the planes through EH, NQ, and let them meet
the planes at 5, T, U, V, W, X, Y, a,
and let the solids FV, Oa be completed;
I say that, in this case too, if the solids AB, CD are equal,
the bases are reciprocally proportional to the heights, that is,
as the base EH is to the base NQ, so is the height of the
solid CD to the height of the solid AB.

Since the solid AB is equal to the solid CD,
while AB is equal to BT,
for they are on the same base EK and of the same height;
[xi. 29, 30]

and the solid CD is equal to DX,
for they are again on the same base RO and of the same
height;
[id-]
therefore the solid BT is also equal to the solid DX.
Therefore, as the base EK is to the base OR, so is the
height of the solid DX to the height of the solid BT.

But the base EK is equal to the base EH,
and the base OR to the base NQ ;
therefore, as the base EH is to the base NQ, so is the height
of the solid DX to the height of the solid BT.
