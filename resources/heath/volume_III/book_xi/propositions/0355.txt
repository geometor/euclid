(solid AB): (solid CV)=CJ HE-.CJ NQ,
[xi. 32]
(solid CD): (solid CV)=CJMQ-.CJ
TQ
[xi. 25]
= CM:CT.
[vi. 1 ]
Therefore
CJ HE : CJ NQ = CM: CT
=
CM:AG.
Conversely (a), if the bases EH, NQ be equal and reciprocally proportional
to the heights, the heights must be equal.
Consequently
(solid AB) = (solid CD).
[xi. 3 1 ]
(t>) If the bases EH, NQ be unequal, if, e.g. O EH> CJ NQ,
then, since
CD EH: CJ NQ = CM: A G,
CM> AG.
Make the same construction as before.
Then
CJEH-.CJNQ
= (solid AB): (solid CV),
[xi. 32]
and
CM:AG=CM:CT
= CJMQ-.CJ TQ
[vi. 1]
= (solid CD): (solid CV).
[xi. 25]
Therefore
(solid AB): (solid CV) = (solid CD) : (solid CV),
whence
(solid AB) = solid CD.
[v. 9]
II. Suppose that the edges terminating at the corners of the bases are not
perpendicular to it.
Drop perpendiculars on the bases from the corners of the faces opposite
to the bases.
We thus have two parallelepipeds equal to AB, CD respectively, since
they are on the same bases EK, RO and of the same height respectively.
[xi. 29, 30]
If then (1) the solid AB is equal to the solid CD,
(solid . 5 7 ^ = (solid Z>A-),
and, by the first part of this proposition,
CJKE:CJOR
= MX: GT,

and

or

O H E - . C J N Q = MX: GT.

(2) If
CJ HE : CJ NQ = MX: GT,
then
CJKE:CJOR
= MX: GT,
so that, by the first half of the proposition, the solids BT, DX are equal, and
consequently
(solid AB) = (solid CD).

T h e text of the second part of the proposition four times contains, after
the words " of the same height," the words " in which the sides which stand
up are not on the same straight lines." A s Simson observed, they are inept,
as the extremities of the edges may or may not be " o n the same straight
l i n e s " ; cf. the similar words incorrectly inserted at the end of x i . 3 1 .
Words purporting to quote the result of the first part of the proposition
are also twice inserted; but they are rejected as unnecessary and as containing
an absurd expression—"(solids) in which the heights axe at right angles to their
bases," as if the heights could be otherwise than perpendicular to the bases.
