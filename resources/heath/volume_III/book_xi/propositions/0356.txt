If there be two equal plane -angles, and on their vertices
there be set up elevated straight lines containing equal angles
with the original straight lines respectively, if on the elevated
straight lines points be taken at random and perpendiculars be
drawn from them to the planes in which the original angles
are, and if from the points so arising in the planes straight
lines be joined to the vertices of the original angles, they will
contain, with the elevated straight lines, equal angles.
Let the angles BA C, EDF be two equal rectilineal angles,
and from the points A, D let the elevated straight lines AG,
DM be set up containing, with the original straight lines,
equal angles respectively, namely, the angle MDE to the
angle GAB and the angle MDE to the angle GAC,
let points G, M be taken at random on A G, DM,
let GL, MN be drawn from the points G, M perpendicular to
the planes through BA, AC and ED, DE, and let them meet
the planes at L, N,
and let LA, ND be joined ;
I say that the angle GAL is equal to the angle MDN.

Let AH be made equal to DM,
and let HK be drawn through the point H parallel to GL.
But GL is perpendicular to the plane through BA,
AC;
therefore HK is also perpendicular to the plane through.

From the points K, N let KC, NF, KB, NE be drawn
perpendicular to the straight lines AC, DF, AB, DE,
and let HC, CB, MF, EE be joined.
