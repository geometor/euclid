Since the square on HA

is equal to the squares on

HK,

and the squares on KC, CA are equal to the square on

KA,

KA,
47]

therefore the square on HA

is also equal to the squares on

HK, KC, CA.
But the square on HC
HK,

is equal to the squares on

KC;

therefore the square on HA

[1.47]

is equal to the squares on

HC, CA.
Therefore the angle HCA

is right.

[1. 48]

For the same reason
the angle DFM is also right.
Therefore the angle A CH is equal to the angle DFM.
But the angle HAC is also equal to the angle MDF.
Therefore MDF, HA C are two triangles which have two
angles equal to two angles respectively, and one side equal to
one side, namely, that subtending one of the equal angles,
that is, HA equal to MD;
therefore they will also have the remaining sides equal to the
remaining sides respectively.
[1. 26]
Therefore AC is equal to DF.
Similarly we can prove that AB is also equal to DE.
Since then AC is equal to DF, and AB to DE,
the two sides CA, AB are equal to the two sides FD, DE.
But the angle CAB is also equal to the angle FDE ;
therefore the base BC is equal to the base EF, the triangle to
the triangle, and the remaining angles to the remaining
angles ;
[1. 4]
therefore the angle ACB is equal to the angle DEE.
But the right angle ACK is also equal to the right angie

DFN;
therefore the remaining angle BCK
remaining angle EFN.

is also equal to the

ror the same reason
the angle CBK is also equal to the angle

FEN.
