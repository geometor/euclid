Therefore BCK, EFN are two triangles which have two
angles equal to two angles respectively, and one side equal to
one side, namely, that adjacent to the equal angles, that is,
BC equal to EF;
therefore they will also have the remaining sides equal to the
[1. 26]
remaining sides.
Therefore CK is equal to FN.
But AC is also equal to DF;
therefore the two sides AC, CK are equal to the two sides

DF,

FN;

and they contain right angles.
Therefore the base AKis equal to the base DN.
[i. 4]
And, since AH is equal to DM,
the square on AH is also equal to the square on DM.
But the squares on AK, KH are equal to the square
on AH,
for the angle AKH is right;
[1. 47]
and the squares on DN, NM are equal to the square
on DM,
for the angle DNM is right;
[i- 47]
therefore the squares on AK, KH are equal to the squares
on DN, NM;
and of these the square on AK is equal to the square on DN;
therefore the remaining square on KH is equal to the square
on NM;
therefore HK is equal to MN.
And, since the two sides HA, AK are equal to the two
sides MD, DN respectively,
and the base HK was proved equal to the base MN,
therefore the angle HAK is equal to the angle MDN.
[1. 8]
Therefore etc.
PORISM.
From this it is manifest that, if there be two
equal plane angles, and if there be set up on them elevated
straight lines which are equal and contain equal angles with
the original straight lines respectively, the perpendiculars
drawn from their extremities to the planes in which are
the original angles are equal to one another.
