This proposition is required for the next, where it is necessary to know
that, if in two equiangular parallelepipeds equal angles, one in each, be
contained by three plane angles respectively, one of which is an angle of the
parallelogram forming the base in one parallelepiped, while its equal is likewise
in the base of the other, and the edges in which the two remaining angles
forming the solid angles meet are equal, the parallelepipeds are of the same
height.
Bearing in mind the definition of the inclination of a straight line to a
plane, we might enunciate the proposition more shortly thus.
If there be two trihedral angles identically equal to one another, corresponding
edges in each are equally inclined to the planes through the other two edges
respectively.
T h e proof, which is necessarily somewhat long, may be summarised thus.
It is required to prove that the angles GAL, MDN in the figure are equal,
G, M being any points on AG, DM, and GL, MN perpendicular to the
planes BA C, EDF respectively.
If AH is made equal to DM, and HK is drawn in the plane GAL parallel
to GL,
HK is also perpendicular to the plane BA C.
[xi. 8]
Draw KB, KC perpendicular to AB, AC respectively and NE, NF
perpendicular to DE, DF respectively, and complete the figures.
Now(i)
HA* = HK + KA'
= HK* + KC* + CA*

Therefore

L HCA = a right angle.
L MFD = a right angle.

(2) A s HAC, MDFhuve therefore two angles equal and one side.
Therefore
AHAC
= AMDF, and AC = DF.
[1. 26]
(3) Similarly A HAB = A MDE, and AB * DE.
(4) Hence A s ABC, DEF are equal in all respects, so that B C - EF,
and

LABC=LDEF,
LACB^^DFE.

(5)

Therefore the complements of these angles are equal,

i.e.

LKBC=LNEF,

and

= t, NEE.
(6) T h e A s KBC, NEFh&ve two angles equal and one side, and are
therefore equal in all respects, so that
KB = NE,
KC=
NF.
(7) T h e right-angled triangles KA C, NDFare equal in all respects, since
AC= DF[( ) above], K C = NF.
Consequently
AK=DN.
