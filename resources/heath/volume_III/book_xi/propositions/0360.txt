T h e Porism is merely a statement of the result arrived at in (8).
Legendre uses, practically, the construction and argument of this propo­
sition to prove the theorem given under (3) of the note on x i . 21 above that
In two equal trihedral angles, corresponding pairs of face angles include equal
dihedral angles. This fact is readily deduced from the above proposition.
Since [(1)] HC, KC are both perpendicular to AC, and MF, NF both
perpendicular to DF, the angles HCK, MFN are the measures of the
dihedral angles between the planes HA C, BA C, and MDF, EDF respec­
tively,
[ x i . Def. 6]
By (6),
KC = NF,
and, by (8),
HK=
MN,
while the angles HKC, MNF, both being right, are equal.
Consequently the A s HCK, MFN axe equal in all respects,
[1. 4]
so that

LHCK=LMFN.

Simson substituted a different proof of ( 1 ) in the above summary, as
follows.
Since HK is perpendicular to the plane BA C, the plane IIBK,
passing
through HK, is also perpendicular to the plane BAC.
[xi. 18]
A n d AB, being drawn in the plane BAC perpendicular to BK, the
common section of the planes HBK, BAC, is perpendicular to the plane
HBK
[ x i . Def. 4], and is therefore perpendicular to every straight line
meeting it in that plane [ x i . Def. 3].
Hence the angle ABH is a right angle.
I think Euclid's proof much preferable to this with its references to
definitions which are more of the nature of theorems.
PROPOSITION

36.

If three straight lines be proportional, the parallelepipedal
solid formed out of the three is equal to the parallelepipedal
solid on the mean which is equilateral, but equiangular with
the aforesaid solid.
Let A, B, C be three straight lines in proportion, so that,
as A is to B, so is B to C;
I say that the solid formed out of A, B, C is equal to the
solid on B which is equilateral, but equiangular with the
aforesaid solid.
Let there be set out the solid angle at E contained by the
angles DEG, GEE, FED,
