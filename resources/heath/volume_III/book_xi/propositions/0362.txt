therefore the parallelepipedal solid formed out of A, B,-C\s
equal to the solid on B which is equilateral, but equiangular
with the aforesaid solid.
Q. E. D.

T h e edges of the parallelepiped HL being respectively equal to A, B, C,
and those of the equiangular parallelepiped KE being all equal to B, we
regard MN (not containing the edge OL equal to B) as the base of the first
parallelepiped, and consequently ED, equiangular to MN, as the base of KE.
T h e n the solids have the same height.
[xi. 35, Por.]
Hence
(solid HL): (solid KE) = CJ MN: CJ ED.
[xi. 3 2]
But, since A, B, C are in continued proportion,
A : B = B : C,
or
LM: EF= DE : LN.
T h u s the sides of the equiangular £ 7 s MN, FD are reciprocally pro­
portional, whence
O MN= CJ FD,
[vi. 14]
and therefore
(solid HL)'= (solid KE).
PROPOSITION

37.

If four straight lines be proportional, the parallelepipedal
solids on them which are similar and similarly described will
also be proportional; and, if the parallelepipedal solids on them
which are similar and similarly described be proportional, the
straight lines will themselves also be proportional.
Let AB, CD, EF, GH be four straight lines in proportion,
so that, as AB is to CD, so is EF to GH;
and let there be described on AB, CD, EF, GH the similar
and similarly situated parallelepipedal solids KA, LC, ME,

NG;
I say that, as KA

is to LC, so is ME to NG.
N

For, since the parallelepipedal solid KA is similar to LC,
therefore KA has to LC the ratio triplicate of that which AB
has to CD.
