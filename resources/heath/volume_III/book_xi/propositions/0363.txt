For the same reason
ME also has to NG the ratio triplicate of that which EF has
to GH.
[id.]
And, as AB is to CD, so is EF to GH.
Therefore also, as AK is to LC, so is ME to NG.
Next, as the solid AK is to the solid LC, so let the solid
ME be to the solid NG ;
I say that, as the straight line AB is to CD, so is EF to GH.
For since, again, AT/4 has to LC the ratio triplicate of that
which AB has to CD,
[xi. 33]
and ME also has to NG the ratio triplicate of that which EF
[id.]
has to GH,
and, as AV2 is to LC, so is ME to A ^,
therefore also, as AB is to CZ?, so is EE to 6 7 / .
Therefore etc.

Q. E. D.


In this proposition it is assumed that, if two ratios be equal, the ratio
triplicate of one is equal to the ratio triplicate of the other and, conversely,
that, if ratios which are the triplicate of two other ratios are equal, those other
ratios are themselves equal.
T o avoid the necessity for these assumptions Simson adopts the alternative
proof found in the MS. which Heiberg calls b, and also adopted by Clavius,
who, however, gives Euclid's proof as well, attributing it to Theon.
The
alternative proof proceeds after the manner of vi. 22, thus.
Make AB, CD, 0, P continuous proportionals, and also EF, GH, Q, R.

I.

Then, since
AB: CD = EF: GH,
we have, ex aequali,
[v. 22]
AB : P= EF: R.
But
(solid AK): (solid CL) =
AB:P,
[xi. 33 and Por.]
and
(solid EM): (solid GN) = EF: R.
Therefore
(solid AK): (solid CL) = (solid EM): (solid
