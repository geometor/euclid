and through the points of section let the planes KN, OR be
carried ;
let US be the common section of the planes, and DG the
diameter of the cube AF.
I say that UT is equal to TS, and DT to TG.
For let DU, UE, BS, SG be joined.
Then, since DO is parallel to PE,
the alternate angles DOU, UPE are equal to one another.

And, since DO is equal to PE, and OU to UP,
and they contain equal angles,
therefore the base DU is equal to the base UE,
the triangle DOU is equal to the triangle PUE,
and the remaining angles are equal to the remaining angles;
[i- 4]

therefore the angle OUD is equal to the angle

PUE.

For this reason DUE is a straight line.
For the same reason, BSG is also a straight line,
and BS is equal to SG.
Now, since CA is equal and parallel to DB,
while CA is also equal and parallel to EG,
therefore DB is also equal and parallel to EG.
