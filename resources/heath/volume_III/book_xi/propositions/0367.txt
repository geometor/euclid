Therefore [1. 26] the triangles DTU, GTS are equal in all respects, so that
DT= TG,
UT= TS.

If there be two prisms of equal height, and one have a
parallelogram as base and the other a triangle, and if the
parallelogram be double of the triangle, the prisms will be
equal.
Let ABCDEF,
GHKLMN
be two prisms of equal
height,
let one have the parallelogram A Fas base, and the other the
triangle GHK,
and let the parallelogram AF be double of the triangle GHK;
I say that the prism ABCDEF
is equal to the prism
GHKLMN.

For let the solids A O, GP be completed.
Since the parallelogram AF is double of the triangle GHK,
while the parallelogram HK is also double of the triangle
GHK,

[1.34]

therefore the parallelogram AF is equal to the parallelogram
HK
But parallelepipedal solids which are on equal bases and
of the same height are equal to one another ;
[xi. 31]
therefore the solid AO is equal to the solid GP.
And the prism ABCDEF is half of the solid AO,
and the prism GHKLMN is half of the solid GP;
[xi. 28]
therefore the prism ABCDEF
is equal to the prism
GHKLMN.
Therefore etc.
