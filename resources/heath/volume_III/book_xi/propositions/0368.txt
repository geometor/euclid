[xi- 39

T h i s proposition is made use of in x n . 3, 4. T h e phraseology is interest­
ing because we find one of the parallelogrammic faces of one of the triangular
prisms called its base, and the perpendicular on this plane from that vertex of
either triangular face which is not in this plane the height.
T h e proof is simple because we have only to complete parallelepipeds
which are double the prisms respectively and then use xi. 3 1 . It has to be
borne in mind, however, that, if the parallelepipeds are not rectangular, the
proof in x i . 28 is not sufficient to establish the fact that the parallelepipeds
are double of the prisms, but has to be supplemented as shown in the note on
that proposition, xii. 4 does, however, require the theorem in its general
form.
