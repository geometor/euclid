PROPOSITION

I.

Similar polygons inscribed in circles are to one another as
the squares on the diameters.
Let ABC, FGH be circles,
let ABCDE, EGHKL be similar polygons inscribed in them,
and let BM, GN be diameters of the circles ;
I say that, as the square on BM is to the square on GN, so
is the polygon ABCDE to the polygon EGHKL.
A

For let BE, AM, GL, EN be joined.
Now, since the polygon ABCDE is similar to the polygon
EGHKL,
the angle BAE is equal to the angle GEL,
and, as BA is to AE, so is GE to FL.
[vi. Def. i ]
Thus BAE, GEL are two triangles which have one angle
equal to one angle, namely the angle BAE to the angle
GEL, and the sides about the equal angles proportional;
therefore the triangle ABE is equiangular with the triangle
[vi. 6]
FGL.
Therefore the angle AEB is equal to the angle FLG.
