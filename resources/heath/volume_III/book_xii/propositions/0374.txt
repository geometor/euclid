But the angle AEB is equal to the angle A MB,
for they stand on the same circumference ;
[m. 27]
and the angle FL G to the angle FNG;
therefore the angle A MB is also equal to the angle FNG.
But the right angle BAM is also equal to the right angle

GFN;

[HI.

31]

therefore the remaining angle is equal to the remaining angle.
[1. 32]

Therefore the triangle ABM
is equiangular with the
triangle FGN.
Therefore, proportionally, as BM is to GN, so is BA
to GF.
[vi. 4]
But the ratio of the square on BM to the square on GN
is duplicate of the ratio of BM to GN,
and the ratio of the polygon ABCDE to the polygon FGHKL
is duplicate of the ratio of BA to GF;
[vi. 20]
therefore also, as the square on BM is to the square on GN,
so is the polygon ABCDE to the polygon
FGHKL.
Therefore etc.
Q. E. D.

As, from this point onward, the text of each proposition usually occupies
considerable space, I shall generally give in the notes a summary of the
argument, to enable it to be followed more easily.
Here we have to prove that a pair of corresponding sides are in the ratio
of the corresponding diameters.
Since L S BAE,
GEL are equal, and the sides about those angles
proportional,
A s ABE, FGL are equiangular,
so that

L AEB

=

LELG

Hence their equals in the same segments, L S AMB,
A n d the right angles BAM, GFN ace equal.
Therefore A s ABM, FGN are equiangular, so that
BM:

GN=

BA

:

FNG,

GF.

T h e duplicates of these ratios are therefore equal,
whence

(polygon ABCDE):

(polygon

FGHKL)

= duplicate ratio of BA to

GF

= duplicate ratio of BM to
