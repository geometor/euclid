Circles are to one another as the squares on the diameters.
Let ABCD, EFGH be circles, and BD, FH
diameters;
I say that, as the circle ABCD is to the circle EFGH,
the square on BD to the square on FH.

For, if the square on BD is not to the square on FH as
the circle ABCD is to the circle EFGH,
then, as the square on BD is to the square on FH, so will
the circle ABCD be either to some less area than the circle
EFGH, or to a greater.
First, let it be in that ratio to a less area S.
Let the square EFGH be inscribed in the circle EFGH;
then the inscribed square is greater than the half of the circle
EFGH, inasmuch as, if through the points E, F, G, H we
druw tangents to the circle, the square EFGH is half the
square circumscribed about the circle, and the circle is less
than the circumscribed square ;
hence the inscribed square EFGH is greater than the half of
the circle EFGH.
Let the circumferences EF, FG, GH, HE be bisected at
the points K, L, M, N,
and let EK, KE, FL, LG, GM, MH, HN, NE be joined ;
therefore each of the triangles EKE, FLG, GMH, HNE is
also greater than the half of the segment of the circle about
it, inasmuch as, if through the points K, L, M, N we draw
tangents to the circle and complete the parallelograms on the
straight lines EF, FG, GH, HE, each of the triangles EKE,
