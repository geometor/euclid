FLG, GMH, HNE
will be half of the parallelogram
about it,
while the segment about it is less than the parallelogram;
hence each of the triangles EKF, FLG, GMH,
HNE
is greater than the half of the segment of the circle
about it.
•

Thus, by bisecting the remaining circumferences and
joining straight lines, and by doing this continually, we shall
leave some segments of the circle which will be less than the
excess by which the circle EFGH exceeds the area S.
For it was proved in the first theorem of the tenth book
that, if two unequal magnitudes be set out, and if from the
greater there be subtracted a magnitude greater than the half,
and from that which is left a greater than the half, and if this
be done continually, there will be left some magnitude which
will be less than the lesser magnitude set out.
Let segments be left such as described, and let the
segments of the circle EFGH on EK, KF, FL, LG, GM,
MH, HN, NE be less than the excess by which the circle
EFGH exceeds the area 5.
Therefore the remainder, the polygon EKFLGMHN,
is
greater than the area 5.
Let there be inscribed, also, in the circle ABCD the poly­
gon AOBPCQDR
similar to the polygon
EKFLGMHN;
therefore, as the square on BD is to the square on FH, so is
the polygon AOBPCQDR
to the polygon
EKFLGMHN.
[XII.

But, as the square on BD is to the square on FH, so also
is the circle ABCD to the area 5 ;
therefore also, as the circle ABCD is to the area S, so is the
polygon AOBPCQDR
to the polygon EKFLGMHN
;
[v. . , ]

therefore, alternately, as the circle ABCD is to the polygon
inscribed in it, so is the arei S to the polygon
EKFLGMHN.
[v. , 6 ]

But the circle ABCD is greater than the polygon inscribed
in it;
therefore the area S is also greater than the polygon

EKFLGMHN.
