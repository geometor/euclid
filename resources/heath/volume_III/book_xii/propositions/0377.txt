But it is also less :
which is impossible.
Therefore, as the square on BD is to the square on FH,
so is not the circle ABCD to any area less than the circle

EFGH.
Similarly we can prove that neither is the circle EFGH
to any area less than the circle ABCD as the square on FH
is to the square on BD.
I say next that neither is the circle ABCD to any area
greater than the circle EFGH as the square on BD is to the
square on FH.
For, if possible, let it be in that ratio to a greater area 5.
Therefore, inversely, as the square on FH is to the square
on DB, so is the area S to the circle ABCD.
But, as the area S is to the circle ABCD, so is the circle
EFGH to somfc area less than the circle ABCD;
therefore also, as the square on FH is to the square on BD,
so is the circle EFGH to some area less than the circle

ABCD:

lv.«]

which was proved impossible.
Therefore, as the square on BD is to the square on FH,
so is not the circle ABCD to any area greater than the circle

EFGH.
And it was proved that neither is it in that ratio to any
area less than the circle EFGH;
therefore, as the square on BD is to the square on FH, so is
the circle ABCD to the circle EFGH.
Therefore etc.
Q. E. D.

LEMMA.

I say that, the area S being greater than the circle
EFGH, as the area S is to the circle ABCD, so is the circle
EFGH to some area less than the circle ABCD.
For let it be contrived that, as the area S is to the circle
ABCD, so is the circle EFGH to the area T.
I say that the area T is less than the circle ABCD.
For since, as the area S is to the circle ABCD, so is the
circle EFGH to the area T,
