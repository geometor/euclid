leaves over segments together less than the excess of X' over S, i.e. a polygon
such that
X' > (polygon in A") > S.
Inscribe in the circle X a polygon similar to that in X.
Then
(polygon in X): (polygon in X') = d :cC
[ x n . 1]
= X : S, by hypothesis;
and, alternately,
(polygon in X): X= (polygon in A " ) : S.
But
(polygon in X) < X;
therefore
(polygon in X') < S.
But, by construction.
(polygon in X') > S:
which is impossible.
Hence 5 cannot be less than X' as supposed.

II. Suppose S> X'.
Since
d* :d'* = X: S,
we have, inversely,
d"': d = S: X.
Suppose that
S:X=X':T,
whence, since $> X',
X > T.
[v. 14]
Consequently
d' : d* = X' : T,
where T < X.
This can be proved impossible in exactly the same way as shown in Part I.
Hence S cannot be greater than X' as supposed.
Since then 5 is neither greater nor less than A ' ,
S- X',
and therefore
d* : d = X : X'.

With reference to the assumption that there is some space S such that
d* : d' - X : S,
i.e. that there is a fourth proportional to the areas d', d'\ X, Simson observes
that it is sufficient, in this and the like cases, that a thing made use of in the
reasoning can possibly exist, though it cannot be exhibited by a geometrical
construction. A s regards the assumption see note on v. 18 above.
There is grave reason for suspecting the genuineness of the Lemma at the
end of the proposition ; though, if it be rejected, it will be necessary to delete
the words " a s was before p r o v e d " in corresponding places in XII. 5, 18.
It will be observed that Euclid proves the impossibility in the second case
by reducing it to the first If it is desired to prove the second case indepen­
dently, we must circumscribe successive polygons to the circles instead of
inscribing them, in the way shown by Archimedes in his first proposition on
the Measurement of a circle. O f course we require, as a preliminary, the
proposition corresponding to x n . 1, that
Similar polygons circumscribed about
circles are to one another as the squares
on the diameters.
Let AB, A'B" be corresponding sides
of the two similar polygons. Then L s
OAS, 0A'B' are equal, since AO, A'O
bisect equal angles.
