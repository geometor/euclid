Similarly L ABO = L
A'B'0.
Therefore A s A OB, A'OB
are similar, so that their areas are in the
duplicate ratio of AB to A'B.
T h e radii OC, 0 C drawn to the points of contact are perpendicular to
AB, A'B, and it follows that
AB

: A'B

= CO :

C'0.

Thus the polygons are to one another in the duplicate ratio of the radii,
and therefore of the diameters.
Now suppose a square ABCD
described about
a circle.
Make an octagon described about the circle by
drawing tangents at the points E etc., where OA etc.
meet the circle.
Then shall the tangent at E cut off more than
half of the area between AK, AH and the arc
HEK.

For the angle AEG
>

is right, and is therefore

LEAG.

Therefore

A G >

EG

>

GK.

Therefore
A A GE > A EGK.
Similarly
A A EE > A EFH.
Hence
A AFG > \ (re-entrant quadrilateral A
HEK),
and a fortiori,
A AFG > § (area between AH, AK and the arc).
T h u s the octagon takes from the square more than half the space between
the square and the circle.
Similarly, if a figure of 16 equal sides be circumscribed by cutting off
symmetrically the corners of the octagon, it will take away more than half of
the space between the octagon and circle.
Suppose now, with the original notation, that
d :
d' =X:S,
where S is greater than A".
Continue the construction of circumscribed polygons about A" until the
total area between the polygon and the circle is less than the difference
between 5 and A", i.e. till
S > (polygon about X') > X'.
Circumscribe a similar polygon about X.
Then
(polygon about X): (polygon about X') = d : d'
= X': S, by hypothesis,
and, alternately,
(polygon about X): X = (polygon about X') : S.
But
(polygon about X) > X.
Therefore
(polygon about X') > S.
But
S > (polygon about X'):
[above]
which is impossible.
H e n c e S cannot be greater than X'.
