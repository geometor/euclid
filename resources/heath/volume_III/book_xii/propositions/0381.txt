Legendre proves this proposition by a method equally rigorous but not, I
think, possessing any advantages over Euclid's. It depends on a lemma
corresponding to Eucl. XII. 16, but with another part added to it.
Two concentric circles being given, we can always inscribe in the greater a
regular polygon such that its sides do not mat the circumference of the lesser, and
we can also circumscribe about the lesser a regular
polygon such that its sides do not meet the circum­
ference of the greater.
Let CA, CB be the radii of the circles.
I. A t A on the inner circle draw the tangent
DE meeting the outer circle in D, E.
Inscribe in the outer circle any of the regular
polygons which we can inscribe, e.g. a square.
Bisect the arc subtended by a side, bisect
the half, bisect that again, and so on, until we
arrive at an arc less than the arc DBE.
Let this arc be MN, and suppose it so placed
that B is its middle point.
Then the chord MN is clearly more distant from the centre C than DE
i s ; and the regular polygon, of which MN is a side, does not anywhere meet
the circumference of the inner circle.
II. Join CM, CN, meeting DE in P, Q.
Then PQ will be the side of a polygon circumscribed about the inner
circle and similar to the polygon inscribed in the outer;
and the circumscribed polygon of which PQ is a side will not anywhere meet
the outer circle.
Legendre now proves x n . 2 after the following manner.
For brevity, let us denote the area of the circle with radius CA by
(circ. CA).
Then it is required to prove that, if OB be the radius of a second circle,
(circ. CA): (circ. OB) = CA*: OB*.

Suppose, if possible, that this relation is not true. T h e n CA* will be to
OB* as (circ. CA) is to an area greater or less than (circ. OB).
I.

Suppose, first, that
CA*: OB* = (circ. CA): (circ. OD),
where OD is less than OB.
