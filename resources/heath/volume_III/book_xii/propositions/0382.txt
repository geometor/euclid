Inscribe in the circle with radius OB a regular polygon such that its sides
do not anywhere meet the circumference of the circle with centre OD;
[Lemma]
and inscribe a similar polygon in the other circle.
T h e areas of the polygons will then be in the duplicate ratio of CA to OB,
or
[xn. i]
(polygon in circ. CA): (polygon in circ. OB)
= CA : OB
= (circ. CA):(circ. OD), by hypothesis.
But this is impossible, because the polygon in (circ. CA) is less than (circ.
CA), but the polygon in (circ. OB) is greater than (circ. OD).
Therefore CA cannot be to OB as (circ. CA) is to a less circle than
(circ. OB).

Suppose, if possible, that
CA : OB = (circ. CA): (some circle > circ. OB).
T h e n inversely
OB : CA = (circ. OB): (some circle < circ. CA),
and this is proved impossible exactly as in Part I.
Therefore
CA : OB = (circ. CA): (circ. OB).

PROPOSITION 

3.

Any pyramid which has a triangular base is divided into
two pyramids equal and similar to one another, similar to the
whole and having triangular bases, and into two equal prisms ;
and the two prisms are greater than the half of the whole
pyramid.
Let there be a pyramid of which the triangle ABC is the
base and the point D the vertex ;
I say that the pyramid ABCD is
divided into two pyramids equal to
one another, having triangular bases
and similar to the whole pyramid,
and into two equal prisms ; and the
two prisms are greater than the half
of the whole pyramid.
For let AB, BC, CA, AD, DB,
DC be bisected at the points E, F,
G, H, K, L, and let HE, EG, GH, HK, KL, LH, KE, FG
be joined.
Since AE is equal to EB, and AH to DH,
therefore EH is parallel to DB.
