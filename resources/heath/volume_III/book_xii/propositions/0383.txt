For the same reason
HK is also parallel to AB.
Therefore HEBK is a parallelogram ;
therefore HK is equal to EB.
[>• 34]
But EB is equal to EA ;
therefore AE is also equal to HK.
But AH is also equal to HD ;
therefore the two sides EA, AH are equal to the two sides
KH, HD respectively ,
and the angle EA H is equal to the angle KHD ;
therefore the base EH is equal to the base KD.
[i. 4]
Therefore the triangle A EH is equal and similar to the
triangle HKD.
For the same reason
the triangle AHG is also equal and similar to the triangle

HLD.
Now, since two straight lines EH, HG meeting one
another are parallel to two straight lines KD, DL meeting
one another, and are not in the same plane, they w;il contain
equal angles.
[xi. 10]
Therefore the angle EHG is equal to the angle KDL.
And, since the two straight lines EH, HG are equal to the
two KD, DL respectively,
and the angle EHG is equal to the angle KDL,
therefore the base EG is equal to the base KL ;
[1. 4]
therefore the triangle EHG is equal and similar to the
triangle KDL.
For the same reason
the triangle AEG is also equal and similar to the triangle

HKL.
Therefore the pyramid of which the triangle AEG is the
base and the point H the vertex is equal and similar to the
pyramid of which the triangle HKL is the base and the point
[xi. Def. 10]
D the vertex.
And, since HK has been drawn parallel, to AB, one of the
sides of the triangle ADB,
