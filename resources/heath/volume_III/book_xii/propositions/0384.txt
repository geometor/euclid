the triangle ADB is equiangular to the triangle DHK, [1. 29]
and they have their sides proportional;
therefore the triangle ADB is similar to the triangle DHK.
[vi. Def. 1]

For the same reason
the triangle DBC is also similar to the triangle DKL, and
the triangle ADC to the triangle DLH.
Now, since the two straight lines BA, AC meeting one
another are parallel to the two straight lines KH, HL meeting
one another, not in the same plane, they will contain equal
angles.
[xi. 10]
Therefore the angle BA C is equal to the angle KHL.
And, as BA is to AC, so is KH to HL ;
therefore the triangle ABC is similar to the triangle HKL.
Therefore also the pyramid of which the triangle ABC is
the base and the point D the vertex is similar to the pyramid
of which the triangle HKL is the base and the point D the
vertex.
But the pyramid of which the triangle HKL is the base
and the point D the vertex was proved similar to the pyramid
of which the triangle AEG is the base and the point H the
vertex.
Therefore each of the pyramids AEGH, HKLD
is
similar to the whole pyramid ABCD.
Next, since BF is equal to EC,
the parallelogram EBEG is double of the triangle GFC.
And since, if there be two prisms of equal height, and one
have a parallelogram as base, and the other a triangle, and if
the parallelogram be double of the triangle, the prisms are
equal,
[xi. 39]
therefore the prism contained by the two triangles BKF,
EHG, and the three parallelograms EBEG, EBKH,
HKEG
is equal to the prism contained by the two triangles GFC,
HKL and the three parallelograms KFCL, LCGH, HKFG.
And it is manifest that each of the prisms, namely that in
which the parallelogram EBEG is the base and the straight
line HK is its opposite, and that in which the triangle GFC is
the base and the triangle HKL its opposite, is greater than
each of the pyramids of which the triangles AEG, HKL are
the bases and the points H, D the vertices,
