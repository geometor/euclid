inasmuch as, if we join the straight lines EF, EK, the prism
in which the parallelogram EBEG is the base and the straight
line HK its opposite is greater than the pyramid of which the
triangle EBF is the base and the point K the vertex.
But the pyramid of which the triangle EBF is the base
and the point K the vertex is equal to the pyramid of which
the triangle AEG is the base and the point H the vertex ;
for they are contained by equal and similar planes.
Hence also the prism in which the parallelogram EBEG
is the base and the straight line HK its opposite is greater
than the pyramid of which the triangle AEG is the base and
the point H the vertex.
But the prism in which the parallelogram EBEG is the
base and the straight line HK its opposite is equal to the
prism in which the triangle GFC is the base and the triangle
HKL its opposite,
and the pyramid of which the triangle AEG is the base and
the point H the vertex is equal to the pyramid of which the
triangle HKL is the base and the point D the vertex.
Therefore the said two prisms are greater than the said
two pyramids of which the triangles AEG, HKL are the
bases and the points H, D the vertices.
Therefore the whole pyramid, of which the triangle ABC
is the base and the point D the vertex, has been divided into
two pyramids equal to one another and into two equal prisms,
and the two prisms are greater than the half of the whole
pyramid.
Q. E. D.


We will denote a pyramid with vertex D and base ABC by D (ABC) or
D-ABC
and the triangular prism with triangles GCF, HLK for bases by
(GCF,

HLK).

T h e following are the steps of the proof.
I. T o prove pyramid H(AEG)
equal and similar to pyramid
Since sides of A DAB are bisected at H, E, K,
HE
|| DE,
and HK || AB.
Hence
HK = EB = EA,
HE

= KB

=

DK.

Therefore (1) A s HAE, DHK axe equal and similar.
Similarly (2) A s HAG, DHL are equal and similar.
Again, LH, HK are respectively || to GA, AE in a different plane;
therefore

LGAE

=

LLHK.

D(HKL).
