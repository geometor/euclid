And LH, HK are respectively equal to GA, AE.
Therefore (3) A s GAE, LHKare
equal and similar.
Similarly (4) A s HGE, DLK are equal and similar.
Therefore [ x l . Def. 10] the pyramids //(AEG)
and D(HKL)
and similar.

are equal

II. T o prove the pyramid D (HKL) similar to the pyramid D
(ABC).
(1) T h e A s DHK, DAB are equiangular and therefore similar.
Similarly (2) A s DLH, DC A are similar, as also (3) the A s DLK,
DCB.
Again, BA, AC axe respectively parallel to KH, HL in a different plane ;
therefore

LBAC=L

KHL.

And
BA : AC= KH:
HL.
Therefore (4) A s BA C, KHL are similar.
Consequently the pyramid D(ABC)
is similar to the pyramid
and therefore also to the pyramid
H(AEG).

D(HKL),

I I I . T o prove prism (GCF, HLK) equal to prism (HGE,
KEB).
T h e prisms may be regarded as having the same height (the distance
between the planes HKL, ABC) and having for bases ( 1 ) the A C G ^ a n d
(2) the O EBEG,
which is the double of the A CGF.
Therefore, by x i . 39, the prisms are equal.
IV.
T o prove the prisms greater than the small pyramids.
Prism (HGE, KFB) is clearly greater than pyramid K(EEB)
and there­
fore greater than pyramid
H(AEG).
Therefore each of the prisms is greater than each of the small pyramids;
and the sum of the two prisms is greater than the sum of the two small
pyramids, which, with the two prisms, make up the whole pyramid.
PROPOSITION

4.

If there be two pyramids of the same height which have
triangular bases, and each of them be divided into two pyramids
equal to one another and similar to the whole, and into two
equal prisms, then, as the base of the one pyramid is to the
base of the other pyramid, so will all the prisms in the one
pyramid be to all the prisms, being equal in multitude, in the
other pyramid.
Let there be two pyramids of the same height which
have the triangular bases ABC, DEF, and vertices the
points G, H,
and let each of them be divided into two pyramids equal to
one another and similar to the whole and into two equal
prisms ;
[xn. 3]
I say that, as the base ABC is to the base DEF, so are
all the prisms in the pyramid ABCG to all the prisms, being
equal in multitude, in the pyramid DEFH,
