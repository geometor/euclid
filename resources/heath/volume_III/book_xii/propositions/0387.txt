For, since BO is equal to OC, and AL to LC,
therefore LO is parallel to
and the triangle ABC is similar to the triangle LOC.

For the same reason
the triangle DEF is also similar to the triangle RVF.
And, since BC is double of CO, and ZTF of jPF ,
therefore, as BC is to CO, so is EF to /^F.
And on BC, CO are described the similar and similarly
situated rectilineal figures ABC,
LOC,
and on EF, FV the similar and similarly situated figures
-

DEF,

RVF;

therefore, as the triangle ABC is to the triangle LOC, so is
the triangle DEF to the triangle RVF;
[vi. 22]
therefore, alternately, as the triangle ABC is to the triangle
DEF, so is the triangle LOC to the triangle RVF.
[v. 16]
But, as the triangle LOC is to the triangle RVF, so is
the prism in which the triangle LOC is the base and PMN its
opposite to the prism in which the triangle R VF is the base
and STU its opposite ;
[Lemma following]
therefore also, as the triangle ABC is to the triangle DEF,
so is the prism in which the triangle LOC is the base and
PMN its opposite to the prism in which the triangle RVF
is the base and S TV its opposite.
But, as the said prisms are to one another, so is the prism
in which the parallelogram KBOL is the base and the straight
line PM its opposite to the prism in which the parallelogram
QEVR is the base and the straight line ST its opposite.
