Therefore also the two prisms, that in which the parallelo­
gram KBOL is the base and PM its opposite, and that in
which the triangle LOC is the base and PMN its opposite,
are to the prisms in which QEVR is the base and the straight
line 57" its opposite and in which the triangle RVF is the
base and STU its opposite in the same ratio
[v. 12]
Therefore also, as the base ABC is to the base DEF, so
are the said two prisms to the said two prisms.
And similarly, if the pyramids PMNG, STUN be divided
into two prisms and two pyramids,
as the base PMN is to the base STU, so will the two prisms
in the pyramid PMNG be to the two prisms in the pyramid

STUH.
But, as the base PMN is to the base STU, so is the base
ABC to the base DEF;
for the triangles PMN, STU are equal to the triangles LOC,
R VF respectively.
Therefore also, as the base ABC is to the base DEF, so
are the four prisms to the four prisms.
And similarly also, if we divide the remaining pyramids
into two pyramids and into two prisms, then, as the base
ABC is to the base DEF, so will all the prisms in the
pyramid ABCG be to all the prisms, being equal in multitude,
in the pyramid DEFH.
Q. E. D.

LEMMA.

But that, as the triangle LOC is to the triangle RVF,
so is the prism in which the triangle LOC is the base and
PMN its opposite to the prism in which the triangle RVF is
the base and STU its opposite, we must prove as follows.
For in the same figure let perpendiculars be conceived
drawn from G, H to the planes ABC, DEF; these are of
course equal because, by hypothesis, the pyramids are of equal
height.
Now, since the two straight lines GCaxiA the perpendicular
from G are cut by the parallel planes ABC, PMN,
they will be cut in the same ratios.
