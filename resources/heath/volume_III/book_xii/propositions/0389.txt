And GC is bisected by the plane PMN at N;
therefore the perpendicular from G to the plane ABC will
also be bisected by the plane PMN.
For the name reason
the perpendicular from H to the plane DEF will also be
bisected by the plane STU.
And the perpendiculars from G, H to the planes ABC,
DEF are equal;
therefore the perpendiculars from the triangles PMN,
STU
to the planes ABC, DEF are also equal.
Therefore the prisms in which the triangles LOC,
RVF
are bases, and PMN, STU their opposites, are of equal
height.
Hence also the parallelepipedal solids described from the
said prisms are of equal height and are to one another as their
bases;
[xi. 32]
therefore their halves, namely the said prisms, are to one another
as the base L OC is to the base R VF.
Q. E. D.

We can incorporate the lemma at the end of the proposition and sum­
marise the proof thus.
Since LO is parallel to AB,
As ABC, LOC are similar.
In like manner
A s DEF, RVF axe similar.
And, since
BC : CO = EF: FV,
AABC: ALOC- ADEF: ARVF,
[vi. 22]
and, alternately,
A ABC: ADEF= ALOC:
ARVF.
Now the prisms (LOC, PMN) and (RVF, STU) are equal in height:
for the perpendiculars from G, H on the bases ABC, DEF are divided by
the planes PMN, STU (parallel to the bases) in the same proportion as GC,
HE axe divided by those planes [xi. 17], i.e. they are bisected;
hence the heights of the prisms, being half the equal heights of the pyramids,
are equal.
A n d the prisms are the halves respectively of parallelepipeds of the same
height on parallelogrammic bases double of the A s LOC, R VF respectively;
[xi. 28 and note]
hence they are in the same ratio as those parallelepipeds, and therefore as
their bases [xi. 32].
Therefore
(prism LOC, PMN): (prism RVF, STU) = ALOC:
ARVF
= A ABC: A DEF.
