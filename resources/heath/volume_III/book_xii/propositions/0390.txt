A n d since the other prisms in the pyramids are equal to these prisms
respectively,
(sum of prisms in GABC): (sum of prisms in HDEF) = AABC:
ADEF.
Similarly, if the pyramids GPMN, HSTU be divided in like manner, and
also the pyramids PAKL, SDQR, we shall have e.g.
(sum of prisms in GPMN):
(sum of prisms in HSTU)
=APMN:ASTU
=
AABC:ADEE
and similarly for the second pair of pyramids.
T h e process may be continued indefinitely, and we shall always have
(sum of prisms in GABC): (sum of prisms in HDEF) = A ABC: A DEF.
PROPOSITION 

5.

Pyramids which are of the same height and have triangular
bases are to one another as the bases.
Let there be pyramids of the same height, of which the
triangles A BC, DEF are the bases and the points G, H the
vertices;
I say that, as the base ABC is to the base DEF, so is the
pyramid ABCG to the pyramid DEFH.

For, if the pyramid ABCG is not to the pyramid DEFH
as the base ABC is to the base DEF,
then, as the base ABC is to the base DEF, so will the
pyramid ABCG be either to some solid less than the pyramid
DEFH or to a greater.
Let it, first, be in that ratio to a less solid W, and let the
pyramid DEFH be divided into two pyramids equal to one
another and similar to the whole and into two equal prisms;
then the two prisms are greater than the half of the whole
pyramid.
