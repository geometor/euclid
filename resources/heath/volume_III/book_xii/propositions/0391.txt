Again, let the pyramids arising from the division be
similarly divided,
and let this be done continually until there are left over from
the pyramid DEFH some pyramids which are less than the
excess by which the pyramid DEFH exceeds the solid W.
[x. 1]
Let such be left, and let them be, for the sake of argument,

DQRS,

STUH;

therefore the remainders, the prisms in the pyramid
are greater than the solid IV.

DEFH,

Let the pyramid ABCG also be divided similarly, and a
similar number of times, with the pyramid DEFH;
therefore, as the base ABC is to the base DEF, so are the
prisms in the pyramid ABCG to the prisms in the pyramid

DEFH.

But, as the base ABC is to the base DEF, so also is the
pyramid ABCG to the solid W;
therefore also, as the pyramid ABCG is to the solid W, so
are the prisms in the pyramid ABCG to the prisms in the
pyramid DEFH \
[v. n ]
therefore, alternately, as the pyramid ABCG is to the prisms
in it, so is the solid W to the prisms in the pyramid DEFH.

But the pyramid ABCG is greater than the prisms in it;
therefore the solid W is also greater than the prisms in the
pyramid DEFH.
But it is also less :
which is impossible.
Therefore the prism ABCG is not to any solid less than
the pyramid DEFH as the base ABC is to the base DEE.
Similarly it can be proved that neither is the pyramid
DEFH to any solid less than the pyramid ABCG as the base
DEF is to the base ABC.
I say next that neither is the pyramid ABCG to any
solid greater than the pyramid DEFH as the base ABC is
to the base DEF.
For, if possible, let it be in that ratio to a greater solid W;
therefore, inversely, as the base DEF is to the base ABC,
so is the solid W to the pyramid ABCG.
