But, as the solid W is to the solid ABCG, so is the
pyramid DEFH to some solid less than the pyramid ABCG,
as was before proved ;
[xn. 2, Lemma]
therefore also, as the base DEF is to the base ABC, so is
the pyramid DEFH
to some solid less than the pyramid

ABCG:

[v. n ]

which was proved absurd.
Therefore the pyramid ABCG is not to any solid greater
than the pyramid DEFH as the base ABC is to the base

DEF.
But it was proved that neither is it in that ratio to a less
solid.
Therefore, as the base ABC is to the base DEF, so is
the pyramid ABCG to the pyramid DEFH.
Q. E. D.


In the two preceding propositions it has been shown how we can divide a
pyramid with a triangular base into ( 1 ) two equal prisms which are together
greater than half the pyramid and (2) two equal pyramids similar to the
original one, and that, if this process be continued with the two pyramids,
then with the four resulting pyramids, and so on, and if, further, another
pyramid of the same height as the original one be similarly divided, the sub­
division being made the same number of times, the sum of all the prisms in
one pyramid is to the sum of all the prisms in the other as the base of the
first is to the base of the second.
We can now prove in the manner of x n . 2 that the volumes of the
pyramids themselves are as the bases.
Let us call the pyramids P, P and their respective bases B, B.
If
P:P*B:B,
suppose that
B:B = P: IV.
I. Let W be < P.
Divide P into two prisms and two pyramids, subdivide the latter similarly,
and so on, until the sum of the pyramids remaining is less than the difference
between P and IV [x. 1], so that
P' > (prisms in P') > XV.
Then divide P similarly, the same number of times.
Now
(prisms in P): (prisms in P) = B :B
[xn. 4]
= P: W, by hypothesis,
and, alternately,
(prisms in P): P= (prisms in P):
But
(prisms in P)
<P;
therefore
(prisms in P') < W.
But, by construction,
(prisms in P) > W.
Hence IV cannot be less than P.
