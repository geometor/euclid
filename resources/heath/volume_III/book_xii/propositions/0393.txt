II. Suppose, if possible, that W-> P".
Then, inversely,
B:B = W:P.
=
P:V,
where V is some solid less than P.
[Cf. x n . 2, Lemma, and note.]
But this can be proved impossible exactly as in Part I.
Therefore
W is neither less nor greater than P',
so that
B:B' =
P:P.
Legendre, followed by the American editors already mentioned, and by
others, approaches the subject by a different route, proving the following
propositions.
1. If a pyramid be cut by a plane parallel to the base, (a) the lateral edges
and the height will be cut in the same proportion, (b) the section by the plane
will be a polygon similar to the base.
V

(a) Since a lateral face VAB of the pyramid V(ABCDE)
is cut by two
parallel planes in AB, ab,
AB || ab;
Similarly BC\\bc, and so on.
Therefore
VA : Va=VB:
Vb= VC:
Vc=....
And, if VO the height be cut in O, o,
BO II bo ; and each of the above ratios is equal to VO : Vo.
(b)

Since BA \\ ba, and BC\\ be,
L ABC= L abc.
[xi. 10]
Similarly for all the other angles of the polygons, which are therefore
equiangular.
Also, by similar triangles,
VA:Va = AB: ab,
and so on.
Therefore, by the ratios above,
AB:ab =
BC:bc=....
Therefore the polygons are similar.
2. If two pyramids of the same height be cut by planes which are at the
same perpendicular distance from the vertices, the sections are as the respective
bases.
