For, if we place the pyramids so that the vertices coincide and the bases
are in one plane, the planes of the sections will coincide.
If, e.g., the base of the second pyramid be XYZ and the section xyz, we
shall have, by the argument of the last proposition,
VX: Vx= VY: Vy = VZ: Vz= VO : Vo= VA : Va = ...,
and XYZ, xyz will be similar.
Now
(polygon ABCDE):
(polygon abcde) - AB* : ab*
= VA' : Vd>,
and
A XYZ : &xyz = XV*:xy*
= VX*: Vx*
= VA*: Va*.
Therefore
(polygon ABCDE):
(polygon abcde) = A XYZ: A xyz.
A s a particular case, if the bases of the two pyramids are equivalent, the
sections are also equivalent.
3. Two triangular pyramids which have equivalent bases and equal heights
are equivalent.
Let VABC, vabc be pyramids with equivalent bases ABC, abc, which for
convenience we will suppose placed in one plane, and let TA be the common
height.

Then, if the pyramids are not equivalent, one must be greater than the other.
Let VABC be the greater; and let AX be the height of a prism on ABC
as base which is equal in volume to the difference of the pyramids.
Divide the height AT'vcAo equal parts such that each is less than AX, and
let each part be equal to 2.
Through the points of division draw planes parallel to the bases cutting
both pyramids in the sections DEE, GHI,... and def, ghi,....
T h e sections DEF, ^ w i l l then be equivalent; so will the sections GHI,
ghi, and so on.
[(2) above]
On the triangles ABC, DEF, GHI, ... as bases draw exterior prisms
having for edges the parts AD, DG, GK,... of the edge A V;
