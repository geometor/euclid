Pyramids which are of the same height and have polygonal
bases are to one another as the bases.
Let there be pyramids of the same height of which the
polygons ABCDE, FGHKL are the bases and the points
M, N the vertices ;
I say that, as the base ABCDE
is to the base FGHKL,
so is the pyramid ABCDEM
to the pyramid FGHKLN.

For let AC, AD, FH, EK be joined.
Since then ABCM, ACDM are two pyramids which have
triangular bases and equal height,
they are to one another as the bases;
[xn. 5]
therefore, as the base ABC is to the base ACD, so is the
pyramid ABCM to the pyramid ACDM.
And, componendo, as the base ABCD is to the base A CD,
so is the pyramid ABCDM
to the pyramid ACDM.
[v. 18]
But also, as the base ACD is to the base ADE, so is the
pyramid ACDM to the pyramid A DEM.
[xn. 5]
Therefore, ex aequali, as the base ABCD is to the base
ADE, so is the pyramid ABCDM
to the pyramid ADEM.
[v. 22]

And again componendo, as the base ABCDE
is to the
base ADE, so is the pyramid ABCDEM
to the pyramid
ADEM.
[v. 18]
Similarly also it can be proved that, as the base FGHKL
is to the base FGH, so is the pyramid FGHKLN
to the
pyramid FGHN.
