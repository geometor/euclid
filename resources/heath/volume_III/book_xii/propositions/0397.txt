And, since ADEM, FGHN are two pyramids which have
triangular bases and equal height,
therefore, as the base ADE is to the base FGH, so is the
pyramid A DEM to the pyramid FGHN.
[xn. 5]
But, as the base ADE is to the base ABCDE, so was
the pyramid ADEM to the pyramid ABCDEM.
Therefore also, ex aequali, as the base ABCDE is to the
base FGH, so is the pyramid ABCDEM
to the pyramid
FGHN.
[v. ]
2 2

But further, as the base FGH is to the base FGHKL, so
also was the pyramid FGHN to the pyramid FGHKLN.
Therefore also, ex aequali, as the base ABCDE is to the
base FGHKL, so is the pyramid ABCDEM
to the pyramid
FGHKLN.
[v. 22]
Q. E. D.


It will be seen that, in order to obtain the proportion
(base ABCDE)

: A ADE

= (pyramid MABCDE)

: (pyramid

MADE),

Euclid employs v. 18 (componendo) twice over, with an ex aequali step [v. 22]
intervening.
We might arrive at it more concisely by using v. 24 extended to any
number of antecedents.
Thus
(pyramid

MADE),

A ACD: A ADE = (pyramid MA CD) : (pyramid

A ABC: A ADE = (pyramid MABC):

MADE),

and lastly
A ADE

: A ADE = (pyramid MADE):

(pyramid

MADE).

Therefore, adding the antecedents [v. 24], we have
(polygon ABCDE):

A ADE = (pyramid MABCDE):

Again, since the pyramids MADE,
A ADE

: AEGH=

NEGHare

(pyramid MADE):

(pyramid

(pyramid

NEGH).

Lastly, using the same argument for the pyramid NFGHKL
MABCDE,
and inverting, we have
A FGH: (polygon FGHKL)

MADE).

of the same height,

= (pyramid NEGH):

(pyramid

as for

NFGHKL).

Thus from the three proportions, ex aequali,
(polygon ABCDE):

(polygon

FGHKL)

= (pyramid MABCDE):

(pyramid

NFGHKL).
