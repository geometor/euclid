Any prism which has a triangular base is divided into three
pyramids equal to one another which have triangular bases.
Let there be a prism in which the triangle ABC is the
base and DEF its opposite;
I say that the prism ABCDEF
is
divided into three pyramids equal to
one another, which have triangular
bases.
For let BD, EC, CD be joined.
Since ABED is a parallelogram,
and BD is its diameter,
therefore the triangle ABD is equal
to the triangle EBD;
[1. 34]
therefore also the pyramid of which the triangle ABD is the
base and the point C the vertex is equal to the pyramid of
which the triangle DEB is the base and the point C the
vertex.
[xn. 5]
But the pyramid of which the triangle DEB is the base
and the point C the vertex is the same with the pyramid of
which the triangle EBC is the base and the point D the
vertex;
for they are contained by the same planes.
Therefore the pyramid of which the triangle ABD is the
base and the point C the vertex is also equal to the pyramid
of which the triangle EBC is the base and the point D the
vertex.
Again, since FCBE is a parallelogram,
and CE is its diameter,
the triangle CEF is equal to the triangle CBE.
[1. 34]
Therefore also the pyramid of which the triangle BCE is
the base and the point D the vertex is equal to the pyramid
of which the triangle ECF is the base and the point D the
vertex.

But the pyramid of which the triangle BCE is the base
and the point D the vertex was proved equal to the pyramid
of which the triangle ABD is the base and the point C the
vertex;
