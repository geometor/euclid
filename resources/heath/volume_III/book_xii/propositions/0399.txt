therefore also the pyramid of which the triangle CEF is the
base and the point D the vertex is equal to the pyramid of
which the triangle ABD is the base and the point C the
vertex;
therefore the prism ABCDEF
has been divided into three
pyramids equal to one another which have triangular bases.
And, since the pyramid of which the triangle ABD is the
base and the point C the vertex is the same with the pyramid
of which the triangle CAB is the base and the point D the
vertex,
for they are contained by the same planes,
while the pyramid of which the triangle ABD is the base and
the point C the vertex was proved to be a third of the prism
in which the triangle ABC is the base and DEF its opposite,
therefore also the pyramid of which the triangle ABC is the
base and the point D the vertex is a third of the prism which
has the same base, the triangle ABC, and DEF as its
opposite.
PORISM.
From this it is manifest that any pyramid is a
third part of the prism which has the same base with it and
equal height.
Q. E. D.


If we denote by C-ABD a pyramid with vertex C and base ABD, Euclid's
argument is easily followed thus.
T h e O ABED being bisected by BD,
(pyramid C-ABD) = (pyramid C-DEB)

B (pyramid
D-EBC).
And, the £ 7 EBCEbeing
bisected by EC,
(pyramid D-EBC) = (pyramid D-ECF).
Thus (pyramid C-ABD) = (pyramid D-EBC) = (pyramid D-ECF),
and
these three pyramids make up the whole prism, so that each is one-third of the
prism.
And, since
(pyramid C-ABD) 3 (pyramid
D-ABC),
(pyramid D-ABC) = \ (prism ABC,
DEF).

Similar pyramids which have triangular bases are in the
triplicate ratio of their corresponding sides.
Let there be similar and similarly situated pyramids of
