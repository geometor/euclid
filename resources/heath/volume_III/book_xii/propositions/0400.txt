which the triangles ABC, DEF, are the bases and the points
G, H the vertices ;
I say that the pyramid ABCG has to the pyramid DEFH
the ratio triplicate of that which BC has to EF.

For let the parallelepipedal solids BGML, EHQP be
completed.
Now, since the pyramid ABCG is similar to the pyramid

DEFH,
therefore the angle ABC is equal to the angle DEF,
the angle GBC to the angle HEF,
and the angle ABG to the angle DEH;
and, as AB is to DE, so is BC to EF, and BG to EH.
And since, as AB is to DE, so is BC to EF,
and the sides are proportional about equal angles,
therefore the parallelogram BM is similar to the parallelo­
gram EQ.
For the same reason
BN is also similar to ER, and BK to EO ;
therefore the three parallelograms MB, BK, BN are similar
to the three EQ, EO, ER.
But the three parallelograms MB, BK, BN are equal and
similar to their three opposites,
and the three EQ, EO, ER are equal and similar to their
three opposites.
[xi. 24]
Therefore the solids BGML, EHQP are contained by
similar planes equal in multitude.
Therefore the solid BGML is similar to the solid EHQP.
But similar parallelepipedal solids are in the triplicate ratio
of their corresponding sides.
