In equal pyramids which have triangular bases the bases
are reciprocally proportional to the heights; and those pyramids
in which the bases are reciprocally proportional to the heights
are equal.
For let there be equal pyramids which have the triangular
bases ABC, DEF and vertices the points G, H;
I say that in the pyramids ABCG, DEFH the bases are
reciprocally proportional to the heights, that is, as the base
ABC is to the base DEF, so is the height of the pyramid
DEFH to the height of the pyramid ABCG.

For let the parallelepipedal solids BGML, EHQP be
completed.
Now, since the pyramid ABCG is equal to the pyramid
DEFH,
and the solid BGML is six times the pyramid ABCG.
and the solid EHQP six times the pyramid DEFH,
therefore the solid BGML is equal to the solid EHQP.
But in equal parallelepipedal solids the bases are recipro­
cally proportional to the heights ;
[xi. 34]
therefore, as the base BM is to the base EQ, so is the height
of the solid EHQP to the height of the solid BGML.
But, as the base BM is to EQ, so is the triangle ABC to
the triangle DEF.
[1. 34]
Therefore also, as the triangle ABC is to the triangle
DEF, so is the height of the solid EHQP to the height of
the solid BGML.
