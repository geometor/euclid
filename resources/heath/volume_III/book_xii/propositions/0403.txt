But the height of the solid EHQP is the same with the
height of the pyramid DEFH,
and the height of the solid BGML is the same with the
height of the pyramid ABCG,
therefore, as the base ABC is to the base DEF, so is the
height of the pyramid DEFH to the height of the pyramid

ABCG.
Therefore in the pyramids ABCG, DEFH
reciprocally proportional to the heights.

the bases are

Next, in the pyramids ABCG, DEFH let the bases be
reciprocally proportional to the heights ;
that is, as the base ABC is to the base DEF, so let the height
of the pyramid DEFH be to the height of the pyramid

ABCG;
I say that the pyramid ABCG

is equal to the pyramid

DEFH.
For, with the same construction,
since, as the base ABC is to the base DEF, so is the height
of the pyramid DEFH to the height of the pyramid ABCG,
while, as the base ABC is to the base DEF, so is the
parallelogram BM to the parallelogram EQ,
therefore also, as the parallelogram BM is to the parallelogram
EQ, so is the height of the pyramid DEFH to the height of
the pyramid ABCG.
[v. n ]
But the height of the pyramid DEFH is the same with
the height of the parallelepiped EHQP,
and the height of the pyramid ABCG is the same with the
height of the parallelepiped BGML ;
therefore, as the base BM is to the base EQ, so is the height
of the parallelepiped EHQP to the height of the parallelepi­

ped

BGML.

But those parallelepipedal solids in which the bases are
reciprocally proportional to the heights are equal;
[xi. 34]
therefore the parallelepipedal solid BGML is equal to the
parallelepipedal solid EHQP.
And the pyramid ABCG is a sixth part of BGML, and
the pyramid DEFH
a sixth part of the parallelepiped

EHQP-
