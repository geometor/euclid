Q. E. D.


T h e volumes of the pyramids are respectively one sixth part of the volumes
of the parallelepipeds described, as in the figure, on double the bases and with
the same heights as the pyramids.
I. T h u s the parallelepipeds are equal if the pyramids are equal.
A n d , the parallelepipeds being equal, their bases are reciprocally propor­
tional to their heights;
[xi. 34]
hence the bases of the equal pyramids (which are the halves of the bases of
the parallelepipeds) are proportional to their heights.
II. If the bases of the pyramids are reciprocally proportional to their
heights, so are the bases of the parallelepipeds to their heights (since the bases
of the parallelepipeds are double of the bases of the pyramids respectively).
Consequently the parallelepipeds are equal.
[xi. 34]
Therefore their sixth parts, the pyramids, are also equal.

PROPOSITION

Any cone is a third part of the cylinder which has the same
base with it and equal height.
For let a cone have the same base, namely the circle
ABCD, with a cylinder and equal
height;
I say that the cone is a third part
of the cylinder, that is, that the
cylinder is triple of the cone.
For if the cylinder is not triple
of the cone, the cylinder will be
either greater than triple or less
than triple of the cone.
First let it be greater than
triple,
and let the square ABCD be
inscribed in the circle ABCD ;
[iv. 6]
then the square ABCD is greater than the half of the circle
ABCD.
From the square ABCD let there be set up a prism of
2qual height with the cylinder.
Then the prism so set up is greater than the half of the
cylinder,
