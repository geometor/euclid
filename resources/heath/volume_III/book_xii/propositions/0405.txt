inasmuch as, if we also circumscribe a square about the circle
ABCD[iv. 7], the square inscribed in the circle ABCD is half
of that circumscribed about it,
and the solids set up from them are parallelepipedal prisms of
equal height,
while parallelepipedal solids which are of the same height are
to one another as their bases ;
[xi. 32]
therefore also the prism set up on the square ABCD is half
of the prism set up from the square circumscribed about the
circle ABCD ;
[cf. xi. 28, or xn. 6 and 7, Por.]
and the cylinder is less than the prism set up from the square
circumscribed about the circle ABCD;
therefore the prism set up from the square ABCD and of
equal height with the cylinder is greater than the half of the
cylinder.
Let the circumferences AB, BC, CD, DA be bisected at
the points E, E, G, H,
and let AE, EB, BE, EC, CG, GD, DH, HA be joined;
then each of the triangles A EB, BEC, CGD, DHA is greater
than the half of that segment of the circle ABCD which is
about it, as we proved before.
[xn. 2]
On each of the triangles AEB, BEC, CGD, DHA
prisms be set up of equal height with the cylinder;

let

then each of the prisms so set up is greater than the half part
of that segment of the cylinder which is about it,
inasmuch as, if we draw through the points E, E, G, H
parallels to AB, BC, CD, DA, complete the parallelograms
on AB, BC, CD, DA, and set up from them parallelepipedal
solids of equal height with the cylinder, the prisms on the
triangles AEB, BEC, CGD, DHA are halves of the several
solids set up;
and the segments of the cylinder are less than the parallelepi­
pedal solids set up;
hence also the prisms on the triangles AEB, BEC, CGD,
DHA are greater than the half of the segments of the
cylinder about them.
Thus, bisecting the circumferences that are left, joining
