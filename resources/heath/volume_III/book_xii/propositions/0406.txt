straight lines, setting up on each of the triangles prisms of
equal height with the cylinder,
and doing this continually,
we shall leave some segments of the cylinder which will be
less than the excess by which the cylinder exceeds the triple
of the cone.
[x. i]
Let such segments be left, and let them be AE, EB, BE,
EC, CG, GD, DH, HA ;
therefore the remainder, the prism of which the polygon
AEBFCGDH
is the base and the height is the same as that
of the cylinder, is greater than triple of the cone.
But the prism of which the polygon AEBFCGDH
is the
base and the height the same as that of the cylinder is triple
of the pyramid of which the polygon AEBFCGDH
is the
base and the vertex is the same as that of the cone ; [xn. 7, Por.]
therefore also the pyramid of which the polygon
AEBFCGDH
is the base and the vertex is the same as that of the cone is
greater than the cone which has the circle ABCD as base.
But it is also less, for it is enclosed by it:
which is impossible.
Therefore the cylinder is not greater than triple of the cone
I say next that neither is the cylinder less than triple of
the cone,
For, if possible, let the cylinder be less than triple of the
cone,
therefore, inversely, the cone is greater than a third part of
the cylinder.
Let the square ABCD be inscribed in the circle ABCD ;
therefore the square ABCD is greater than the half of the
circle ABCD.
Now let there be set up from the square ABCD a pyramid
having the same vertex with the cone ;
therefore the pyramid so set up is greater than the half part
of the cone,
seeing that, as we proved before, if we circumscribe a square
