about the circle, the square ABCD will be half of the square
circumscribed about the circle,
and if we set up from the squares parallelepipedal solids of
equal height with the cone, which are also called prisms, the
solid set up from the square ABCD will be half of that set up
from the square circumscribed about the circle;
for they are to one another as their bases.
[xi. 32]
Hence also the thirds of them are in that ratio;
therefore also the pyramid of which the square ABCD is the
base is half of the pyramid set up from the square circum­
scribed about the circle.
And the pyramid set up from the square about the circle
is greater than the cone,
for it encloses it.
Therefore the pyramid of which the square ABCD is the
base and the vertex is the same with that of the cone is
greater than the half of the cone.
Let the circumferences AB, BC, CD, DA be bisected at
the points E, E, G, H,
and let AE, EB, BE, EC, CG, GD, DH, HA be joined;
therefore also each of the triangles AEB, BEC, CGD, DHA
is greater than the half part of that segment of the circle
ABCD which is about it.
Now, on each of the triangles AEB, BEC, CGD, DHA
let pyramids be set up which have the same vertex as the
cone;
therefore also each of the pyramids so set up is, in the same
manner, greater than the half part of that segment of the cone
which is about it.
Thus, by bisecting the circumferences that are left, joining
straight lines, setting up on each of the triangles a pyramid
which has the same vertex as the cone,
and doing this continually,
we shall leave some segments of the cone which will be less
than the excess by which the cone exceeds the third part of
the cylindei.

Let such be left, and let them be the segments on AE,
EB, BE, EC, CG, GD, DH, HA ;
