PROPOSITION

Cones and cylinders which are of the same height are to
one another as their bases.
Let there be cones and cylinders of the same height,
let the circles ABCD, EFGH be their bases, KL, MN their
axes and A C, EG the diameters of their bases ;
I say that, as the circle ABCD is to the circle EFGH, so is
the cone AL to the cone EN.

For, if not, then, as the circle ABCD is to the circle
EFGH, so will the cone AL be either to some solid less
than the cone EN or to a greater.
First, let it be in that ratio to a less solid O, and let the
solid X be equal to that by which the solid 0 is less than the
cone EN;
therefore the cone EN is equal to the solids O, X.
Let the square EFGH be inscribed in the circle EFGH;
therefore the square is greater than the half of the circle.
Let there be set up from the square EFGH a pyramid of
equal height with the cone;
therefore the pyramid so set up is greater than the half of the
cone,
inasmuch as, if we circumscribe a square about the circle, and
set up from it a pyramid of equal height with the cone, the
inscribed pyramid is half of the circumscribed pyramid,
for they are to one another as their bases,
[xn. 6]
while the cone is iess than the circumscribed pyramid.
