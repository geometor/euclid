Let the circumferences EE, EG, GH, HE be bisected at
the points P, Q, R, S,
and let HP, PE, EQ, QF, FR, RG, GS, SH be joined.
Therefore each of the triangles HPE, EQF, ERG, GSH
is greater than the half of that segment of the circle which is
about it.
On each of the triangles HPE, EQF, ERG, GSH let
there be set up a pyramid of equal height with the cone;
therefore, also, each of the pyramids so set up is greater than
the half of that segment of the cone which is about it.
Thus, bisecting the circumferences which are left, joining
straight lines, setting up on each of the triangles pyramids of
equal height with the cone,
and doing this continually,
we shall leave some segments of the cone which will be less
than the solid X.
[x. 1]
Let such be left, and let them be the segments on HP,
PE. EQ, QF, ER, RG, GS, SH;
therefore the remainder, the pyramid of which the polygon
HPEQFRGS
is the base and the height the same with that
of the cone, is greater than the solid O.
Let there also be inscribed in the circle ABCD the
polygon DTAUBVCWsimilar
and similarly situated to the
polygon
HPEQFRGS,
and on it let a pyramid be set up of equal height with the cone
AL.
Since then, as the square on A C is to the square on EG, so
is the polygon DTA UBVCW io the polygon
HPEQFRGS,
[XII.

while, as the square on A C is to the square on EG, so is the
circle ABCD to the circle EFGH,
[xn. 2]
therefore also, as the circle ABCD is to the circle EFGH, so
is the polygon DTA UBVCW to the polygon
HPEQFRGS.
But, as the circle ABCD is to the circle EFGH, so is the
cone AL to the solid O,
and, as the polygon DTAUBVCW
is to the polygon
HPEQFRGS,
so is the pyramid of which the polygon
DTA UBVCWis
the base and the point L the vertex to the
pyramid of which the polygon HPEQFRGS
is the base and
the point A the vertex.
