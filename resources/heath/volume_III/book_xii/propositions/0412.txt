Therefore also, as the cone AL is to the solid O, so is the
pyramid of which the polygon DTA UBVCW is the base and
the point L the vertex to the pyramid of which the polygon
HPEQFRGS
is the base and the point N the vertex ; [v. 11]
therefore, alternately, as the cone AL is to the pyramid in it,
so is the solid O to the pyramid in the cone EN.
[v. 16J
But the cone AL is greater than the pyramid in it;
therefore the solid O is also greater than the pyramid in the
cone EN.
But it is also less:
which is absurd.
Therefore the cone AL is not to any solid less than the
cone EN as the circle ABCD is to the circle EFGH.
Similarly we can prove that neither is the cone EN to
any solid less than the cone AL as the circle EFGH is to the
circle ABCD.
I say next that neither is the cone AL to any solid greater
than the cone EN as the circle ABCD is to the circle

EFGH,
For, if possible, let it be in that ratio to a greater solid 0;
therefore, inversely, as the circle EFGH is to the circle
ABCD, so is the solid O to the cone AL.
But, as the solid O is to the cone AL, so is the cone EN
to some solid less than the cone AL ;
therefore also, as the circle EFGH is to the circle ABCD, so
is the cone EN to some solid less than the cone AL :
which was proved impossible.
Therefore the cone AL is not to any solid greater than
the cone EN as the circle ABCD is to the circle EFGH.
But it was proved that neither is it in this ratio to a less
solrd;
therefore, as the circle ABCD is to the circle EFGH, so is
the cone AL to the cone EN.
But, as the cone is to the cone, so is the cylinder to the
cylinder,
for each is triple of each ;
