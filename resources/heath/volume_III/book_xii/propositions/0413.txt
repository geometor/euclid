Therefore also, as the circle ABCD is tD the circle
EFGH, so are the cylinders on them which are of equal
height.
Therefore etc.
Q. E. D.


We need not again repeat the preliminary construction of successive
pyramids and prisms exhausting the cones and cylinders.
Let Z, Z' be the volumes of the two cones, ft ft their respective bases.
If
/i:ft*Z:Z',
then must
fi:ft
= Z:0,
where O is either less or greater than Z'.
I. Suppose, if possible, that O is less than Z'.
Inscribe in Z' a pyramid (IT) leaving over portions of it together less than
(Z - O), i.e. such that

z' > ir > o.

Inscribe in Z a pyramid n on a polygon inscribed in the circular base of
Z similar to the polygon which is the base of IT.
Now, if d, a" be the diameters of the bases,
P:P = d':a"*
[xn. 2]
= (polygon in ft): (polygon in
ft)
[xn. 1]
= n : n'.
[xu. 6]
Therefore
Z : 0 = 1 1 : IT,
and, alternately,
Z : II = O : IT.
But Z>Tl, since it includes it:
therefore
O > II'.
But, by construction,
O < II':
which is impossible.
Therefore
O^Z.
II.

Suppose, if possible, that
p:ft = Z:0,
where O is greater than Z,'.
Therefore
P:ft = 0':Z',
where O is some solid less than Z
That is,
ft
: ft = Z: O',
where 0 < Z
This is proved impossible exactly in the same way as the assumption in
Part I. was proved impossible.
Therefore Z has not either to a less solid than Z' or to a greater solid than
Z' the ratio of /J to ft;
therefore
p-.p = Z:Z'.
The same is true of the cylinders which are equal to 3Z, $Z' respectively.
