I 2.

Similar cones and cylinders are to one another in the
triplicate ratio of the diameters in their bases.
Let there be similar cones and cylinders,
let the circles ABCD, EFGH be their bases, BD, EH the
diameters of the bases, and KL, MN the axes of the cones
and cylinders;
I say that the cone of which the circle ABCD is the base and
the point L the vertex has to the cone of which the circle
EFGH is the base and the point N the vertex the ratio
triplicate of that which BD has to EH.

For, if the cone ABCDL has not to the cone EFGHN
the ratio triplicate of that which BD has to EH,
the cone ABCDL
will have that triplicate ratio either to
some solid less than the cone EFGHN or to a greater.
First, let it have that triplicate ratio to a less solid O.
Let the square EFGH be inscribed in the circle EFGH;
[iv. 6]

therefore the square EFGH is greater than the half of the
circle EFGH.
Now let there be set up on the square EFGH a pyramid
having the same vertex with the cone ;
therefore the pyramid so set up is greater than the half part
of the cone.
