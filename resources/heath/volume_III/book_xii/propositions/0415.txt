Let the circumferences EE, EG, GH, HE be bisected at
the points P, Q, R, S,
and let EP, PE, EQ, QG, GR, RH, HS, SE be joined.
Therefore each of the triangles EPF, LjG, GRH,
HSE
is also greater than the half part of that segment of the circle
EFGH which is about it.
Now on each of the triangles EPF, FQG, GRH, HSE
let a pyramid be set up having the same vertex with the cone;
therefore each of the pyramids so set up is also greater than
the half part of that segment of the cone which is about it.
Thus, bisecting the circumferences so left, joining straight
lines, setting up on each of the triangle- pyramids having the
same vertex with the cone,
and doing this continually,
we shall leave some segments of the cone which will be less
than the excess by which the cone EFGHN
exceeds the
solid O.
[x. 1]
Let such be left, and let them be the segments on EP,
PE, EQ, QG, GR, RH, HS, SE;
therefore the remainder, the pyramid of whi< h the polygon
EPFQGRHS
is the base and the point N the vertex, is
greater than the solid O.
Let there be also inscribed in the circle ABCD the
polygon ATBUCVDWsimilar
and similarly situated to the
polygon
EPFQGRHS,
and let there be set up on the polygon ATBUCVDW
a.
pyramid having the same vertex with the cone;
of the triangles containing the pyramid of which the polygon
ATBUCVDW
is the base an:' He point L the vertex let
LB The one,
and of the triangles containing the pyramid of which the
polygon EPFQGRHS
is the base and the point N the vertex
let NFP be one ;
and let KT, MP be joined.
Now, since the cone ABCDL
is similar to the cone
EFGHN,
therefore, as BD is to EH, so is the axis KL to th axis MN.
