But, as BD is to FH, so is BK to FM \
therefore also, as BK is to FM, so is KL to MN.
And, alternately, as BK is to KL, so is FM to ^fA/.
[v. ,6]

And the sides are proportional about equal angles, namely
the angles BKL,
FMN;
therefore the triangle BKL is similar to the triangle FMN..

Again, since, as BK is to KT, so is FM to MP,
and they are about equal angles, namely the angles BKT,
FMP,
inasmuch as, whatever part the angle BKT is of the four
right angles at the centre K, the same part also is the angle
FMP of the four right angles at the centre M;
since then the sides are proportional about equal angles,
therefore the triangle BKT is similar to the triangle FMP.
[vi. 6]

Again, since it was proved that, as BK is to KL, so is FM
to MN,
while BK is equal to KT, and FM to PM,
therefore, as TK is to KL, so is PM to MN;
and the sides are proportional about equal angles, namely
the angles TKL, PMN, for they are right;
therefore the triangle LKT is similar to the triangle NMP.
[vi. 6]

And since, owing to the similarity of the triangles LKB,
NMF,
as LB is to BK, so is NF to FM,
and, owing to the similarity of the triangles BKT, FMP,
as KB is to BT, so is MF to FP,
therefore, ex aequali, as LB is to BT, so is NF to FP. [v. 22]
Again since, owing to the similarity of the triangles L TK,
NPM,
as L T is to TK, so is NP to PM,
and, owing to the similarity of the triangles TKB, PMF,
as KT is to TB, so is MP to PF;
therefore, ex aequali, as L T is to TB, so is NP to PF. [v. 22]
