But it was also proved that, as TB is to BL, so is PF
to FN.
Therefore, ex aequali, as TL is to LB, so is PN to NF.
[v. 22]

Therefore in the triangles LTB, NPF the sides are
proportional;
therefore the triangles L TB, NPF are equiangular;
[vi. 5]
hence they are also similar.
[vi. Def. 1]
Therefore the pyramid of which the triangle BKT is the
base and the point L the vertex is also similar to the pyramid
of which the triangle FMP is the base and the point N the
vertex,
for they are contained by similar planes equal in multitude.
[xi. Def. 9]

But similar pyramids which have triangular bases are to
one another in the triplicate ratio of their corresponding sides.
[xn. 8]

Therefore the pyramid BKTL has to the pyramid FMPN
the ratio triplicate of that which BK has to FM.
Similarly, by joining straight lines from A, IV, D, V, C, U
to K, and from E, S, H, R, G, Q to M, and setting up on
each of the triangles pyramids which have the same vertex
with the cones,
we can prove that each of the similarly arranged pyramids
will also have to each similarly arranged pyramid the ratio
triplicate of that which the corresponding side BK has to the
corresponding side FM, that is, which BD has to FH.
And, as one of the antecedents is to one of the conse­
quents, so are all the antecedents to all the consequents;
[v. 12]

therefore also, as the pyramid BKTL
is to the pyramid
FMPN, so is the whole pyramid of which the polygon
ATBUCVDW'is
the base and the point L the vertex to the
whole pyramid of which the polygon EPFQGRHS
is the
base and the point N the vertex;
hence also the pyramid of which ATBUCVDW
is the base
and the point L the vertex has to the pyramid of which the
polygon EPFQGRHS
is the base and the point N the
vertex the ratio triplicate of that which BD has to FH.
But, by hypothesis, the cone of which the circle ABCD
