is the base and the point L the vertex has also to the solid
O the ratio triplicate of that which BD has to EH;
therefore, as the cone of which the circle ABCD is the base
and the point L the vertex is to the solid O, so is the pyramid
of which the polygon A TBUCVDW
is the base and L the
vertex to the pyramid of which the polygon EPFQGRHS
is
the base and the point N the vertex;
therefore, alternately, as the cone of which the circle ABCD
is the base and L the vertex is to the pyramid contained in
it of which the polygon ATBUCVDW
is the base and L
the vertex, so is the solid O to the pyramid of which the
polygon EPFQGRHS
is the base and N the vertex, [v. 16]
But the said cone is greater than the pyramid in it;
for it encloses it.
Therefore the solid O is also greater than the' pyramid of
which the polygon EPFQGRHS
is the base and N the
vertex.
But it is also less :
which is impossible.
Therefore the cone of which the circle ABCD is the base
and L the vertex has not to any solid less than the cone of
which the circle EFGH is the base and the point N the
vertex the ratio triplicate of that which BD has to FH:
Similarly we can prove that neither has the cone EFGHN
to any solid less than the cone ABCDL
the ratio triplicate
of that which FH has to BD.
I say next that neither has the cone ABCDL
to any
solid greater than the cone EFGHN
the ratio triplicate of
that which BD has to FH.
For, if possible, let it have that ratio to a greater solid O.
Therefore, inversely, the solid O has to the cone ABCDL
the ratio triplicate of that which FH has to BD.
But, as the solid O is to the cone ABCDL,
so is the
cone EFGHN to some solid less than the cone ABCDL.
Therefore the cone EFGHN also has to some solid less
than the cone ABCDL the ratio triplicate of that which FH
has to BD:
which was proved impossible.
