Therefore the cone ABCDL
has not to any solid greater
than the cone EFGHN
the ratio triplicate of that which BD
has to FH.
But it was proved that neither has it this ratio to a less
solid than the cone
EFGHN.
Therefore the cone ABCDL
has to the cone
EFGHN
the ratio triplicate of that which BD has to FH.
But, as the cone is to the cone, so is the cylinder to the
cylinder,
for the cylinder which is on the same base as the cone and
of equal height with it is triple of the cone;
[xn. io]
therefore the cylinder also has to the cylinder the
triplicate of that which BD has to FH.
Therefore etc.

Q. E. D.


The method of proof is precisely that of the previous proposition. The
only addition is caused by the necessity of proving that, if similar equilateral
polygons be inscribed in the bases of two similar cones, and pyramids be
erected on them with the same vertices as those of the cones, the pyramids
(are similar and) are to one another in the triplicate ratio of corresponding
edges.
Let KL, MN be the axes of the cones, L, N the vertices, and let BT, FP
be sides of similar polygons inscribed in the bases. Join BK, TK, BL, TL,
PM, FM, PN, FN.

Now BKL, FMN are right-angled triangles, and, since the cones are
similar,
BK: KL = FM: MN.
[xi. Def. 24]
Therefore (1)
A s BKL, FMN are similar.
[vh 6]
Similarly (2)
A s TKL, PMNare similar.
Next, in A s BKT, FMP, the angles BKT, FMP are equal, since each is
the same fraction of four right angles; and the sides about the equal angles are
proportional;
therefore
(3)
A s BKT, FMP are similar.
