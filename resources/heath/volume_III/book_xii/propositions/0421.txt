Suppose, if possible, that
(ratio triplicate of d :d') = X: O,
where O is greater than X';
then
(ratio triplicate of d :d')= Z: X',
or, inversely,
(ratio triplicate of d': d) = X': Z,
where Z is some solid less than X.
This is proved impossible by the exact method of Part I.
Hence O cannot be either greater or less than X',
and
X: X' = (ratio triplicate of ratio d: d').

PROPOSITION 

1 3 .

If a cylinder be cut by a plane which is parallel to its
opposite planes, then, as the cylinder is to the cylinder, so will
the axis be to the axis.
For let the cylinder AD be cut by the plane GH which
is parallel to the opposite planes AB, CD,
and let the plane GH meet the axis at the point K;
I say that, as the cylinder BG is to the cylinder GD, so is
the axis EK to the axis KF.

u w
For let the axis EE be produced in both directions to the
points L, M,
and let there be set out any number whatever of axes EN, NL
equal to the axis EK,
and any number whatever FO, OM equal to EK;
and let the cylinder PW on the axis LM be conceived of
which the circles PQ, V W are the bases.
Let planes be carried through the points N, O parallel to
AB, CD and to the bases of the cylinder PW,
and let them produce the circles RS, TU about the centres
N, 0.
Then, since the axes LN,
another,

NE,

EK

are equal to one
