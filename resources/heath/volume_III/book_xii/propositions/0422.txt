therefore the cylinders QR, RB, BG are to one another as
their bases.
[xn. n ]
But the bases are equal ;
therefore the cylinders QR, RB, BG are also equal to one
another.
Since then the axes LN, NE, EK are equal to one
another,
and the cylinders QR, RB, BG are also equal to one another,
and the multitude of the former is equal to the multitude of
the latter,
therefore, whatever multiple the axis KL is of the axis EK,
the same multiple also will the cylinder QG be of the
cylinder GB.
For the same reason, whatever multiple the axis MK is
of the axis KF, the same multiple also is the cylinder WG
of the cylinder GD.
And, if the axis KL is equal to the axis KM, the cylinder
QG will also be equal to the cylinder G W,
if the axis is greater than the axis, the cylinder will also be
greater than the cylinder,
and if less, less.
Thus, there being four magnitudes, the axes EK,
KF
and the cylinders BG, GD,
there have been taken equimultiples of the axis EK and of
the cylinder BG, namely the axis LK and the cylinder QG,
and equimultiples of the axis KF and of the cylinder GD,
namely the axis KM and the cylinder GW;
and it has been proved that,
if the axis KL is in excess of the axis KM, the cylinder QG
is also in excess of the cylinder GW,
if equal, equal,
and if less, less.
Therefore, as the axis EK is to the axis KF, so is the
cylinder BG to the cylinder GD.

It is not necessary to reproduce the proof, as it follows exactly the method
of vi. 1 and XL 25.
The fact that cylinders described about axes of equal length and having
