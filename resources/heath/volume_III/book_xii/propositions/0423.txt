equal bases are equal is inferred from XII. 11 to the effect that cylinders of
equal height are to one another as their bases.
That, of two cylinders with unequal axes but equal bases, the greater is
that which has the longer axis is of course obvious either by application or by
cutting off from the cylinder with the longer axis a cylinder with an axis of the
same length as that of the other given cylinder.
PROPOSITION 

1 4 .

Cones and cylinders which are on equal bases are to one
another as their heights.
For let EB, ED be cylinders on equal bases, the circles
AB, CD:
I say that, as the cylinder EB is
to the cylinder ED, so is the axis
GH to the axis KL.
For let the axis KL be pro­
duced to the point N,
let LN be made equal to the axis
GH,
and let the cylinder CM be conceived about LN as axis.
Since then the cylinders EB, CM are of the same height,
they are to one another as their bases.
[xn. n ]
But the bases are equal to one another;
therefore the cylinders EB, CM are also equal.
And, since the cylinder FM has been cut by the plane
CD which is parallel to its opposite planes,
therefore, as the cylinder CM is to the cylinder ED, so is the
axis LN to the axis KL.
[xu. 13]
But the cylinder CM is equal to the cylinder EB,
and the axis LN to the axis GH;
therefore, as the cylinder EB is to the cylinder ED, so is the
axis GH to the axis KL.
But, as the cylinder EB is to the cylinder ED, so is the
cone ABG to the cone CDK.
[xn. 10]
Therefore also, as the axis GH is to the axis KL, so is
the cone ABG to the cone CDK and the cylinder EB to the
cylinder ED.
Q. E. D.

No separate proposition corresponding to this is necessary in the case of
parallelepipeds, for XI. 25 really contains the property corresponding to that in
this proposition as well as the property corresponding to that in xu. 13.
