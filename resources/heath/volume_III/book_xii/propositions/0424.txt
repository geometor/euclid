In equal cones and cylinders the bases are reciprocally
proportional to the heights; and those cones and cylinders in
which the bases are reciprocally proportional to the heights are
equal.
Let there be equal cones and cylinders of which the circles
ABCD, EFGH are the bases;
let A C, EG be the diameters of the bases,
and KL, MN the axes, which are also the heights of the
cones or cylinders;
let the cylinders A O, EP be completed.
I say that in the cylinders AO, EP the bases are re­
ciprocally proportional to the heights,
that is, as the base ABCD is to the base EFGH, so is the
height MN to the height KL.

For the height LK is either equal to the height MN or
not equal.
First, let it be equal.
Now the cylinder AO is also equal to the cylinder EP.
But cones and cylinders which are of the same height are
to one another as their bases ;
[xu. n ]
therefore the base ABCD is also equal to the base EFGH.
Hence also, reciprocally, as the base ABCD is to the base
EFGH, so is the height MN to the height KL.
Next, let the height LK not be equal to MN,
but let MN be greater ;
from the height MN let QN be cut off equal to KL,
through the point Q let the cylinder EP be cut by the plane
TUS parallel to the planes of" the circles EFGH, RP,
