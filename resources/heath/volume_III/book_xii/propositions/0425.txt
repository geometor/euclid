and let the cylinder ES be conceived erected from the circle
EFGH as base and with height NQ.
Now, since the cylinder A O is equal to the cylinder EP,
therefore, as the cylinder A O is to the cylinder ES, so is the
cylinder EP to the cylinder ES.
[v. 7]
But, as the cylinder AO is to the cylinder ES, so is the
base ABCD to the base EFGH,
for the cylinders AO, ES are of the same height;
[xn. 11]
and, as the cylinder EP is to the cylinder ES, so is the height
MN to the height QN,
for the cylinder EP has been cut by a plane which is parallel
to its opposite planes.
[xn. 13]
Therefore also, as the base ABCD is to the base EFGH,
so is the height MN to the height QN.
[v. n ]
But the height QN is equal to the height KL ;
therefore, as the base ABCD is to the base EFGH, so is the
height MN to the height KL.
Therefore in the cylinders AO, EP the bases are re­
ciprocally proportional to the heights.
Next, in the cylinders AO, EPlet the bases be reciprocally
proportional to the heights,
that is, as the base ABCD is to the base EFGH, so let the
height MN be to the height KL ;
I say that the cylinder AO Is equal to the cylinder EP.
For, with the same construction,
since, as the base ABCD is to the base EFGH, so is the
height MN to the height KL,
while the height KL is equal to the height QN,
therefore, as the base ABCD is to the base EFGH, so is the
height MN to the height QN
But, as the base ABCD is to the base EFGH, so is the
cylinder AO to the cylinder ES,
for they are of the same height;
[xn. 11]
and, as the height MN is to QN, so is the cylinder EP to the
cylinder ES;
[xu. 13]
therefore, as the cylinder A 0 is to the cylinder ES, so is the
cylinder EP to the cylinder ES.
