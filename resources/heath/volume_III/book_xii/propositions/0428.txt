Let ABCD, EFGH be the two given circles about the
same centre K;
thus it is required to inscribe in the
greater circle ABCD an equilateral
polygon with an even number of
sides which does not touch the circle
EFGH.
For let the straight line BKD
be drawn through the centre K,
and from the point G let GA be
drawn at right angles to the straight
line BD and carried through to C;
therefore AC touches the circle EFGH.

[m. 16, Por.]

Then, bisecting the circumference BAD, bisecting the
half of it, and doing this continually, we shall leave a circum­
ference less than AD.
[x, i]
Let such be left, and let it be LD;
from L let LM be drawn perpendicular to BD and carried
through to N,
and let LD, DN be joined ;
therefore LD is equal to DN.
[in. 3,1. 4]
Now, since LN is parallel to AC,
and AC touches the circle EFGH,
therefore LN does not touch the circle EFGH;
therefore LD, DN are far from touching the circle EFGH.
If then we fit into the circle ABCD straight lines equal
to the straight line LD and placed continuously, there will
be inscribed in the circle ABCD an equilateral polygon with
an even number of sides which does not touch the lesser
circle EFGH.
Q. E. D.

It must be carefully observed that the polygon inscribed in the outer circle
in this proposition is such that not only do its own sides not touch the inner
circle, but also the chords, as LN, joining angular points next but one to each
other do not touch the inner circle either. In other words, the polygon is the
second in order, not the first, which satisfies the condition of the enunciation.
This is important, because such a polygon is wanted in the next proposition;
hence in that proposition the exact construction here given must be followed.
