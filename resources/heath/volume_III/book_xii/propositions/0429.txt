PROPOSITION 

1 7 .

Given two spheres about the same centre, to inscribe in the
greater sphere a polyhedral solid which does not touch the
lesser sphere at its surface.
Let two spheres be conceived about the same centre A ;
thus it is required to inscribe in the greater sphere a poly­
hedral solid which does not touch the lesser sphere at its
surface.

Let the spheres be cut by any plane through the centre ;
then the sections will be circles,
inasmuch as the sphere was produced by the diameter
remaining fixed and the semicircle being carried round it;
[xi. Def. 14]

hence, in whatever position we conceive the semicircle to be,
the plane carried through it will produce a circle on the
circumference of the sphere.
And it is manifest that this circle is the greatest possible,
