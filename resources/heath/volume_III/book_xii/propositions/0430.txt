inasmuch as the diameter of the sphere, which is of course
the diameter both of the semicircle and of the circle, is greater
than all the straight lines drawn across in the circle or the
sphere.
Let then BCDE be the circle in the greater sphere,
and FGH the circle in the lesser sphere ;
let two diameters in them, BD, CE. oe drawn at right angles
to one another;
then, given the two circles BCDE, FGH about the same
centre, let there be inscribed in the greater circle BCDE an
equilateral polygon with an even number of sides which does
not touch the lesser circle FGH,
let BK, KL, LM, ME be its sides in the quadrant BE.
let KA be joined and carried through to N,
let AO be set up from the point A at right angles to the
plane of the circle BCDE, and let it meet the surface of the
sphere at O,
and through A O and each of the straight lines BD, KN let
planes be carried ;
they will then make greatest circles on the surface of the
sphere, for the reason stated.
Let them make such,
and in them let BOD, KON be the semicircles on BD, KN.
Now, since OA is at right angles to the plane of the circle
BCDE,
therefore all the planes through OA are also at right angles
to the plane of the circle BCDE ;
[xi. 18]
hence the semicircles BOD, KON are also at right angles to
the plane of the circle BCDE.
And, since the semicircles BED, BOD, KON are equal,
for they are on the equal diameters BD, KN,
therefore the quadrants BE, BO, KO are also equal to one
another.
Therefore there are as many straight lines in the quadrants
BO, KO equal to the straight lines BK, KL, LM, ME as
there are sides of the polygon in the quadrant BE.
Let them be inscribed, and let them be BP, PQ, QR, RO
and KS, ST, TU, UO,
let SP, TQ, UR be joined,
