and from P, S let perpendiculars be drawn to the plane of the
circle BCDE ;
[xi. n ]
these will fall on BD, KN, the common sections of the planes,
inasmuch as the planes of BOD, KON are also at right angles
to the plane of the circle BCDE.
[cf. xi. Def. 4]
Let them so fall, and let them be PV, SW,
and let WV be joined.
Now since, in the equal semicircles BOD, KON, equal
straight lines BP, KS have been cut off,
and the perpendiculars PV, SWhzve been drawn,
therefore PVis equal to SW, and BVto KW.
[111. 27, 1. 26]
But the whole BA is also equal to the whole KA ;
therefore the remainder VA\s also equal to the remainder WA ;
therefore, as BV is to VA, so is KW to WA ;
therefore WV is parallel to KB.
[vi. 2]
And, since each of the straight lines PV, SW is at right
angles to the plane of the circle BCDE,
therefore PV is parallel to SW.
[xi. 6]
But it was also proved equal to it;
therefore WV, SP are also equal and parallel.
[1. 33]
And, since WV is parallel to SP,
while WV is parallel to KB,
therefore SP is also parallel to KB.
[xi. 9]
And BP, KS join their extremities ;
therefore the quadrilateral KBPS is in one plane,
inasmuch as, if two straight lines be parallel, and points be
taken at random on each of them, the straight line joining the
points is in the same plane with the parallels.

For the same reason
each of the quadrilaterals SPQT, TQRU is also in one plane.
But the triangle URO is also in one plane.
[xi. 2]
If then we conceive straight lines joined from the points
P, S, Q, T, R, U to A, there will be constructed a certain
polyhedral solid figure between the circumferences BO, KO,
consisting of pyramids of which the quadrilaterals
KBPS,
SPQT, TQRU and the triangle URO are the bases and the
point A the vertex.
