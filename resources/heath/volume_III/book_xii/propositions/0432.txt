And, if we make the same construction in the case of each
of the sides KL, LM, ME as in the case of BK, and further
in the case of the remaining three quadrants,
there will be constructed a certain polyhedral figure in­
scribed in the sphere and contained by pyramids, of which
the said quadrilaterals and the triangle URO, and the others
corresponding to them, are the bases and the point A the
vertex.
I say that the said polyhedron will not touch the lesser
sphere at the surface on which the circle FGH is.
Let AX be drawn from the point A perpendicular to the
plane of the quadrilateral KBPS, and let it meet the plane at
the point X;
[xi. n]
let XB, XK be joined.
Then, since AX is at right angles to the plane of the
quadrilateral KBPS,
therefore it is also at right angles to all the straight lines
which meet it and are in the plane of the quadrilateral.
[xi. Def. 3]

Therefore AX is at right angles to each of the straight
lines BX, XK.
And, since AB is equal to AK,
the square on AB is also equal to the square on AK.
And the squares on AX, XB are equal to the square
on AB,
for the angle at X is right;
[1. 47]
and the squares on AX, XK are equal to the square on AK.
[id.]

Therefore the squares on AX, XB are equal to the squares
on AX,
XK.
Let the square on AX be subtracted from each ;
therefore the remainder, the square on BX, is equal to the
remainder, the square on XK;
therefore BX is equal to XK.
Similarly we can prove that the straight lines joined
from X to P, S are equal to each of the straight lines BX,
XK.
