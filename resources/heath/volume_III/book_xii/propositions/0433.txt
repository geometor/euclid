Therefore the circle described with centre X and distance
one of the straight lines XB, XK will pass through P, S also,
and KBPS will be a quadrilateral in a circle.
Now, since KB is greater than WV,
while WV is equal to SP,
therefore KB is greater than SP.
But KB is equal to each of the straight lines KS, BP;
therefore each of the straight lines KS, BP is greater than SP.
And, since KBPS is a quadrilateral in a circle,
and KB, BP, KS are equal, and PS less,
and BX is the radius of the circle,
therefore the square on KB is greater than double of the
square on BX.
Let KZ be drawn from K perpendicular to BV.
Then, since BD is less than double of DZ,
and, as BD is to DZ, so is the rectangle DB, BZ to the
rectangle DZ, ZB,
if a square be described upon BZ and the parallelogram on
ZD be completed,
then the rectangle DB, BZ is also less than double of the
rectangle DZ, ZB.
And, if KD be joined,
the rectangle DB, BZ is equal to the square on BK,
and the rectangle DZ, ZB equal to the square on KZ;
[111. 3 1 , vi. 8 and Por.]

therefore the square on KB is less than double of the square
on KZ.
But the square on KB is greater than double of the square
on BX;
therefore the square on KZ is greater than the square on BX.
And, since BA is equal to KA,
the square on BA is equal to the square on A K.
And the squares on BX, XA are equal to the square on BA,
and the squares on KZ, ZA equal to the square on KA ;
['•47]

therefore the squares on BX, XA are equal to the squares on
KZ. ZA,
