and of these the square on KZ is greater than the square
on BX;
therefore the remainder, the square on ZA, is less than the
square on XA.
Therefore AX is greater than AZ;
therefore AX is much greater than AG.
And AX is the perpendicular on one base of the poly­
hedron,
and A G on the surface of the lesser sphere ;
hence the polyhedron will not touch the lesser sphere on its
surface.
Therefore, given two spheres about the same centre, a
polyhedral solid has been inscribed in the greater sphere
which does not touch the lesser sphere at its surface.
Q. E. D.


PORISM. But if in another sphere also a polyhedral solid
be inscribed similar to the solid in the sphere BCDE,
the polyhedral solid in the sphere BCDE has to the poly­
hedral solid in the other sphere the ratio triplicate of that
which the diameter of the sphere BCDE has to the diameter
of the other sphere.
For, the solids being divided into their pyramids similar
in multitude and arrangement, the pyramids will be similar.
But similar pyramids are to one another in the triplicate
ratio of their corresponding sides ;
[xn. 8, Por.]
therefore the pyramid of which the quadrilateral KBPS is
the base, and the point A the vertex, has to the similarly
arranged pyramid in the other sphere the ratio triplicate of
that which the corresponding side has to the corresponding
side, that is, of that which the radius AB of the sphere about
A as centre has to the radius of the other sphere.
Similarly also each pyramid of those in the sphere about
A as centre has to each similarly arranged pyramid of those
in the other sphere the ratio triplicate of that which AB has
to the radius of the other sphere.
And, as one of the antecedents is to one of the conse­
quents, so are all the antecedents to all the consequents ;
