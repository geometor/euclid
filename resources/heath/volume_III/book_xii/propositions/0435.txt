hence the whole polyhedral solid in the sphere about A as
centre has to the whole polyhedral solid in the other sphere
the ratio triplicate of that which AB has to the radius of the
other sphere, that is, of that which the diameter BD has to
the diameter of the other sphere.
Q. E. D.


This proposition is of great length and therefore requires summarising in
order to make it easier to grasp. Moreover there are some assumptions in it
which require to be proved, and some omissions to be supplied. The figure
also is one of some complexity, and, in addition, the text and thefiguretreat
two points Z and V, which are really one and the same, as different.
The first thing needed is to know that all sections of a sphere by planes
through the centre are circles and equal to one another (great circles or
" greatest circles " as Euclid calls them, more appropriately). Euclid uses his
definition of a sphere as the figure described by a semicircle revolving about
its diameter. This of course establishes that all planes through the particular
diameter make equal circular sections ; but it is also assumed that the same
sphere is generated by any other semicircle of the same size and with its
centre at the same point.

The construction and argument of the proposition may be shortly given
as follows.
A plane through the centre of two concentric spheres cuts them in great
circles of which BE, GEar& quadrants.
A regular polygon with an even number of sides is inscribed (exactly as in
Prop. 16) to the outer circle such that its sides do not touch the inner circle.
BK, KL, LM, ME are the sides in the quadrant BE.
