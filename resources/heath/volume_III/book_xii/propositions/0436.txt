AO is drawn at right angles to the plane ABE, and through AO are
drawn planes passing through B, K, L, M, E, etc., cutting the sphere in great
circles.
OB, OK are quadrants of two of these great circles.
As these quadrants are equal to the quadrant BE, they will be divisible
into arcs equal in number and magnitude to the arcs BK, KL, LM, ME.
Dividing the other quadrants of these circles, and also all the quadrants of
the other circles through OA, in this way we shall have in all the circles a
polygon equal to that in the circle of which BE is a quadrant
BP, PQ, QR, KO and KS, ST, TV, UO are the sides of these polygons
in the quadrants BO, KO.
Joining PS, QT, RU, and making the same construction all round the
circles through AO, we have a certain polyhedron inscribed in the outer
sphere.
Draw PV perpendicular to AB and therefore (since the planes OAB,
BAE are at right angles) perpendicular to the plane BAE;
[xi. Def. 4]
draw SW perpendicular to ^ATand therefore (for a like reason) perpendicular
to the plane BAE.
Draw KZ perpendicular to BA. (Since BK = BP, and DB.BV = BP ,
DB.BZ= BK , it follows that BV= BZ, and Z, Vcoincide.)
Now, since L S PA V, SA W, being angles subtended at the centre by
equal arcs of equal circles, are equal,
and since
L s PVA, SWA are right,
while AS=AP,
A s PA V, SA Ware equal in all respects,
[1. 26]
and
AV=AW.
Consequently
AB : AV= AK: AW;
and VW, BKure parallel.
But PV, SW are parallel (being both perpendicular to one plane) and
equal (by the equal A s PA V, SA W),
therefore
VW, PS are equal and parallel.
Therefore BK (being parallel to VW) is parallel to PS.
Consequently (1) BPSK is a quadrilateral in one plane.
Similarly the other quadrilaterals PQTS, QRUTare in one plane; and
the triangle OR U is in one plane.
In order now to prove that the plane BPSK does not anywhere touch the
inner sphere we have to prove that the shortest distance from A to the plane
is greater than AZ, which by the construction in xu. 16 it greater than AG.
Draw AX perpendicular to the plane BPSK.
Then AX* + XB = AX* + XK' = AX* + XS' = AX' + XP> = AB ,
whence
XB=XK=XS=
XP,
or (2) the quadrilateral BPSK is inscribable in a circle with X as centre and
radius XB.
Now
BK> VW
> PS;
therefore in the quadrilateral BPSK three sides BK, BP, KS are equal, but
PS is less.
Consequently the angles about X are three equal angles and one smaller
angle;
