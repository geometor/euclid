therefore any one of the equal angles is greater than a right angle, i.e. L BXK
is obtuse.
Therefore (3)
BK >zBX\
[11. 12]
Next, consider the semicircle BKD with KZ drawn perpendicular to BD.
We have
BD < 2DZ,
so that
DB.BZ<
zDZ.ZB,
or
BK- < 2KZ ;
therefore, a fortiori, [by (3) above]
(4)
BX* < KZ .
Now
AK' h AB •
therefore
AZ + ZK = AX + XB .
And
BX*<KZ*;
therefore
AX >AZ\
or (5)
AX> AZ.
But, by the construction in xn. 16, AZ>AG;
therefore, a fortiori,
AX> AG.
And, since the perpendicular AX is the shortest distance from A to the
plane BPSK,
(6) the plane BPSK does not anywhere meet the inner sphere.

Euclid omits to prove that, a fortiori, the other quadrilaterals PQTS,
QRUT, and the triangle ROU, do not anywhere meet the inner sphere.
For this purpose it is only neeessary to show that the radii of the circles
circumscribing BPSK, PQTS, QRUT and ROU are in descending order of
magnitude.

We have therefore to prove that, if ABCD,

while AB is not greater than AD, A'B' = CD, and AB>CD>
CD,
then the radius OA of the circle circumscribing the first quadrilateral is greater
than the radius OA' of the circle circumscribing the second.
Clavius, and Simson after him, prove this by reductio ad absurdum.

whence the four angles about 0 are together greater than the four angles
about O, i.e. greater than four right angles ;
which is impossible.
