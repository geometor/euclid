(2) If OA'> OA,
cut off from OA, OB, OC, O'D lengths equal to OA, and draw the inner
quadrilateral as shown in the figure (XYZW).
Then
AB>A'B»XY,
CD>
CD>ZW,

AD = A'D > WX,

BC=BC>
YZ.
Consequently the same absurdity as in (1) follows a fortiori.
Therefore, since OA is neither equal to nor less than OA',
OA > OA'.

The fact is also sufficiently clear if we draw MO, NO bisecting DA, DC
perpendicularly and therefore meeting in O, the centre of the circumscribed
circle, and then suppose the side DA with the perpendicular MO to turn
inwards about D as centre. Then the intersection of MO and NO, as P, will
gradually move towards N.
Simson gives his proof as "Lemma 11." immediately before xn. 17.
He adds to the Porism some words explaining how we may construct a
similar polyhedron in another sphere and how we may prove that the
polyhedra are similar.
The Porism is of course of the essence of the matter because it is the
porism which as much as the construction is wanted in the next proposition.
It would therefore not have been amiss to include the Porism in the enuncia­
tion of xn. 17 so as to call attention to it

the ratio

F o i , if the sphere ABC has not to the sphere DEF the
ratio triplicate of that which BC has to EE,
then the sphere ABC will have either to some less sphere
than the sphere DEF, or to a greater, the ratio triplicate of
that which BC has to EE.
First, let it have that ratio to a less sphere GHK,
let DEF be conceived about the same centre with GHK,
let there be inscribed in the greater sphere DEF a poly­
hedral solid which does not touch the lesser sphere GHK at
its surface,
