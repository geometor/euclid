and let there also be inscribed in the spnere ABC a poly­
hedral solid similar to the polyhedral solid in the sphere DEF;
therefore the polyhedral solid in ABC has to the polyhedral
solid in DEF the ratio triplicate of that which BC has to EE.
[xn. 17, Por.]

But the sphere ABC also has to the sphere GHK
ratio triplicate of that which BC has to EE;

the

therefore, as the sphere ABC is to the sphere GHK, so is
the polyhedral solid in the sphere ABC to the polyhedral
solid in the sphere DEE;
and, alternately, as the sphere ABC is to the polyhedron in
it, so is the sphere GHK to the polyhedral solid in the
sphere DEE.
[v. 16]
But the sphere ABC is greater than the polyhedron in i t ;
therefore the sphere GHK is also greater than the polyhedron
in the sphere DEE.
But it is also less,
for it is enclosed by it.
Therefore the sphere ABC has not to a less sphere than
the sphere DEF the ratio triplicate of that which the diameter
BC has to EE.
