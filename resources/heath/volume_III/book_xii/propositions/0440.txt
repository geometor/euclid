Similarly we can prove that neither has the sphere DEF
to a less sphere than the sphere ABC the ratio triplicate of
that which EE has to BC.
I say next that neither has the sphere ABC to any greater
sphere than the sphere DEE the ratio triplicate of that which
BC has to EE.
For, if possible, let it have that ratio to a greater, LMN;
therefore, inversely, the sphere LMN has to the sphere ABC
the ratio triplicate of that which the diameter EE has to the
diameter BC.
But, inasmuch as LMN

is greater than

DEF,

therefore, as the sphere LMN is to the sphere ABC, so is the
sphere DEE to some less sphere than the sphere ABC, as
was before proved.
[xn. 2, Lemma]
Therefore the sphere DEF also has to some less sphere
than the sphere ABC the ratio triplicate of that which EE
has to BC:
which was proved impossible.
Therefore the sphere ABC has not to any sphere greater
than the sphere DEE the ratio triplicate of that which BC
has to EE.
But it was proved that neither has it that ratio to a less
sphere.
Therefore the sphere ABC has to the sphere DEF the
ratio triplicate of thai which BC has to EE.
Q. E. D.


It is the method of this proposition which Legendre adopted for his proof
of xn. 2 (see note on that proposition).
The argument can be put very shortly. We will suppose S, S' to be the
volumes of the spheres, and d, d' to be their diameters; and we will for brevity
express the triplicate ratio of d to d' by d : d' .
If
d*:d'** Si?,
then
d :d' = S-.r,
where Tis the volume of some sphere either greater or less than S'.

I. Suppose, if possible, that T< S'.
Let ^ b e supposed concentric with S'.
As in xn. 17, inscribe a polyhedron in S' such that its faces do not any­
where touch T;
and inscribe in S a polyhedron similar to that in S'.
