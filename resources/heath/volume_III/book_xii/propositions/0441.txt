S:T=d :d'
= (polyhedron in S) : (polyhedron in S');

or, alternately,
5 : (polyhedron in S) = T: (polyhedron in S').
And
S > (polyhedron in S);
therefore
T> (polyhedron in S').
But, by construction, T< (polyhedron in S'):
which is impossible.
Therefore
S'.
II. Suppose, if possible, that T > S'.
Now
d' :d' = S: T
= X:S\
where X is the volume of some sphere less than S,
[xn. 2, Lemma]
or, inversely,
d'' : d = S': X,
where X < S.
This is proved impossible exactly as in Part I.
Therefore
r > S'.
Hence T, not being greater or less than S', is equal to it, and
d :d' = S: S'.
