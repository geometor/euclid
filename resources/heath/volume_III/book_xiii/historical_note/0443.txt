Hypsicles proceeds (pp. 7 sqq.) to give a proof of this theorem. Allman
pointed out (Greek Geometry from Thales to Euclid, 1889, pp. 201—2) that this
proof depends on eight theorems, six of which appear in Euclid's Book xm.
(in Propositions 8, 10, 12, 15, 16 with Por., 1 7 ) ; two other propositions not
mentioned by Allman are also used, namely XIII. 4 and 9. This seems, as
Allman says, to confirm the inference of Bretschneider (p. 1 7 1 ) that, as
Aristaeus' work was the newest and latest in which, before Euclid's time, this
subject was treated, we have in Eucl. xm. at least a partial recapitulation of
the contents of the treatise of Aristaeus.
After Euclid, Apollonius wrote on the comparison of the dodecahedron
and the icosahedron inscribed in one and the same sphere. This we also
learn from Hypsicles, who says in the next words following those about
Aristaeus above quoted: " But it is proved by Apollonius in the second
edition of his Comparison of the dodecahedron with the icosahedron that, as th
surface of the dodecahedron is to the surface of the icosahedron [inscribed
in the same sphere], so is the dodecahedron itself [i.e. its volume] to the
icosahedron, because the perpendicular is the same from the centre of the
sphere to the pentagon of the dodecahedron and to the triangle of the
icosahedron."
