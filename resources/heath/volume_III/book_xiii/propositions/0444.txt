PROPOSITION 

I.

If a straight line be cut in extreme and mean ratio, the
square on the greater segment added to the half of the whole
is five times the square on the half.
For let the straight line AB be cut in extreme and mean
ratio at the point C,
and let A Che the greater segment;
let the straight line AD be pro­
duced in a straight line with CA,
and let AD be made half of AB;
M,<
I say that the square on CD is
five times the square on AD.
For let the squares AE, DF
be described on AB, DC,
and let the figure in DF be drawn ;
let EC be carried through to G.
Now, since AB has been cut in
extreme and mean ratio at C,
therefore the rectangle AB, BC is
equal to the square on AC.
[vi. Def. 3, vi. 17]

And CE is the rectangle AB, BC, and EH the square
on AC;
therefore CE is equal to FH.
And, since BA is double of AD,
while BA is equal to KA, and AD to AH,
therefore KA is also double of AH.
But, as KA is to AH, so is CK to CH;
[vi. 1]
therefore CK is double of CH.
But LH, HC are also double of CH.
Therefore KC is equal to LH, HC.
