Therefore
(rect. BA, AC) + (rect. AB, BC) = 4 (sq. on AB),
or
(sq. on AB) = 4 (sq. on AD):
and this is true, since
AD =\AB.
(Synthesis.)
Since
(sq. on AB) = 4 (sq. on AD),
and
(sq. on AB) = (rect. BA, AC) + (rect. AB, BC),
therefore
4 (sq. on AD) = 2(rect. DA, AC) + sq. on ^4C.
Adding to each the square on AD, we have
(sq. on CD) = 5 (sq. on AD).

If the square on a straight line be five times the square on
a segment of it, then, when the double of the said segment is cut
in extreme and mean ratio, the greater segment is the remaining
part of the original straight line.
For let the square on the straight line AB be five times
the square on the segment AC
of it,
and let CD be double of AC;
I say that, when CD is cut in extreme
, . N /
and mean ratio, the greater segment
is CB.

Let the squares AF, CG be de­
6
scribed on AB, CD respectively,
B
D
let the figure in AF be drawn,
A
C
and let BE be drawn through.
Now, since the square on BA is
five times the square on AC,
AF is five times AH.
Therefore the gnomon MNO is
quadruple of AH.
And, since DC is double of CA,
therefore the square on DC is quadruple of the square on CA,
that is, CG is quadruple of AH.
But the gnomon MNO was also proved quadruple of AH;
therefore the gnomon MNO is equal to CG.
And, since DC is double of CA,
while DC is equal to CK, and AC to CH,
therefore KB is also double of BH.
