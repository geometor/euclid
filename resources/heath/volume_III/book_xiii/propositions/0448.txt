But LH, HB are also double of HB ;
therefore KB is equal to LH, HB,
But the whole gnomon MNO was also proved equal to
the whole CG ;
therefore the remainder HF is equal to BG.
And BG is the rectangle CD, DB,
for CD is equal to DG;
and HF is the square on CB ;
therefore the rectangle CD, DB is equal to the square on CB.
Therefore, as DC is to CB, so is CB to BD.
But DC is greater than CB;
therefore CB is also greater than BD.
Therefore, when the straight line CD is cut in extreme and
mean ratio, CB is the greater segment.
Therefore etc.
Q. E. D.


LEMMA.

That the double of AC is greater than BC is to be proved
thus.
If not, let BC be, if possible, double of CA.
Therefore the square on BC is quadruple of the square
on CA ;
therefore the squares on BC, CA are five times the square
on CA.
But, by hypothesis, the square on BA is also five times
the square on CA ;
therefore the square on BA is equal to the squares on BC, CA:
which is impossible.
[it. 4]
Therefore CB is not double of AC.
Similarly we can prove that neither is a straight line less
than CB double of CA ;
for the absurdity is much greater.
Therefore the double of A C is greater than CB.
Q. E. D.


This proposition is the converse of Prop. I. We have to prove that, if
AB be so divided at C that
(sq. on AB) = 5 (sq. on AC),
and if CD =2AC,
then
(rect. CD, DB) = (sq. on CB).
