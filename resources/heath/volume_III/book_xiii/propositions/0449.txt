Subtract from each side the sq. on AC;
then
(gnomon MNO) = 4 (sq. on A C)
= (sq. on CD).
Now, as in the last proposition,
O CE= 2(CJBH)
= CJBH + a HL.
Subtracting these equals from the equals, the square on CD and the
gnomon MNO respectively, we have
CJ BG = (square HF),
i.e.
(rect. CD, DB) = (sq. on CB).
Here again the proposition can readily be proved by means of a figure
similar to that of 11. 11.
Draw CA through C at right angles to CB and of length equal to CA in
the original figure; make CD double of CA;
produce A C to R so that CR = CB.
Complete the squares on CB and CD, and
join AD.
Now we are given the fact that
(sq. on AR) = 5 (sq. on CA).
B
0
But
5 (sq. on AC) = (sq. on AC) + (sq. on CD)
= (sq. on AD).
Therefore
(sq. on AR) = (sq. on AD),
or
AR = AD.
Now
(rect KR, RC) + (sq. on ^ C ) = (sq. on
= (sq. on AD)
= (sq. on AC) + (sq. on C73).
Therefore
(rect. KR. RC) = (sq. on CD).
That is,
(rectangle RE) = (square CG).
Subtract the common part CE,
and
(rect. BG) = (sq. RB),
or
rect. CD, DB = (sq. on CB).
Heiberg, with reason, doubts the genuineness of the Lemma following this
proposition.

PROPOSITION 

3.

If a straight line be cut in extreme and mean ratio, the
square on the lesser segment added to the half of the greater
segment is five times the square on the half of the greater
segment.
