For let any straight line AB be cut in extreme and mean
ratio at the point C,
let AC be the greater segment,
A
D
O
B
and let AC be bisected at D ;
I say that the square on BD is
five times the square on DC.

For let the square AE be
M
described on AB,
Q
and let the figure be drawn

double.

Since AC is double of DC,
therefore the square on AC is
quadruple of the square on DC,
that is, RS is quadruple of EG.
And, since the rectangle AB, BC is equal to the square
on AC,
and CE is the rectangle AB, BC,
therefore CE is equal to RS.
But RS is quadruple of EG;
therefore CE is also quadruple of EG.
Again, since AD is equal to DC,
HK is also equal to KF.
Hence the square GF is also equal to the square HL.
Therefore GK is equal to KL, that is, MN to NE ;
hence ME is also equal to EE.
But ME is equal to CG;
therefore CG is also equal to EE.
Let CN be added to each ;
therefore the gnomon OPQ is equal to CE.
But CE was proved quadruple of GF;
therefore the gnomon OPQ is also quadruple of the square EG.
Therefore the gnomon OPQ and the square EG are
five times EG.
But the gnomon OPQ and the square EG are the
square DN.
A n d DN is the square on DB, and GF the square on DC.
Therefore the square on DB is five times the square
on DC.
Q. E. D.
