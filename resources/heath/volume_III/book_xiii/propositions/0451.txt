In this case we have
(sq. on BD) = (sq. BG) + (rect. CG) + (rect. CN)
= (sq. BG) + (rect. BE) + (rect. CN)
= (sq. EG) + (rect. CE)
= (sq. EG) + (rect. AB, BC)
= (sq. BG) + (sq. on A C), by hypothesis,
= 5 (sq. on .DC).
The theorem is still more obvious if the figure
of II. I I be used. Let C ^ b e divided in extreme
and mean ratio at E, by the method of it. ft.
Then, since
(rect. AB, BC) + (sq. on CD)
= sq. on BD
= sqs. on CD, CB,
(rect. AB, BC) = (sq. on CB)
= (sq. on CA),
and AB is divided at C in extreme and mean ratio.
And
(sq. on BD) = (sq. on DB)
= 5 (sq. on CD).

PROPOSITION

4.

If a straight line be cut in extreme and mean ratio, the
square on the whole and the square on the lesser segment together
are triple of the square on the greater segment.
Let AB be a straight line,
let it be cut in extreme and mean ratio at C,
and let A Che the greater segment;
I say that the squares on AB, BC are
11
triple of the square on CA.
L /
For let the square ADEB
be de­
scribed on AB,
and let the figure be drawn.
Since then AB has been cut in extreme
and mean ratio at C,
and A C is the greater segment,
therefore the rectangle AB, BC is equal to the square on AC.

[vi. Def. 3, vi. 17]

And AK is the rectangle AB, BC, and HG the square
on AC;
therefore AK is equal to HG.
