And, since AF is equal to F£,
let CK be added to each ;
therefore the whole AK is equal to the whole CE ;
therefore AK, CE are double of AK.
But AK, CE are the gnomon LMN and the square CK;
therefore the gnomon LMN and the square CK are double
of AK.
But, further, AK was also proved equal to HG;
therefore the gnomon LMN and the squares CK, LIG are
triple of the square HG.
And the gnomon LMN and the squares CK, HG are
the whole square AE and CK, which are the squares on
AB, BC,
while HG is the square on AC.
Therefore the squares on AB, BC are triple of the square
on AC.
Q. E. D.


Here, as in the preceding propositions, the results are proved de novo by
the method of Book II., without reference to that Book. Otherwise the proof
might have been shorter.
For, by n. 7,
(sq. on AB) + (sq. on BC) = 2 (rect. AB, BC) + (sq. on AC)
= 3 (sq. on A C).
PROPOSITION 

5.

If a straight line be cut in extreme and mean ratio, and
there be added to it a straight line equal to the greater segment,
the whole straight line has been cut in extreme and mean ratio,
and the original straight line is the greater segment.
For let the straight line AB be cut in extreme and mean
ratio at the point C,
let AC be the greater segment,
and let AD be equal to AC.
I say that the straight line
DB has been cut in extreme and
L
H
mean ratio at A, and the original
straight line AB is the greater
segment.
For let the square AE be described on AB,
and let the figure be drawn.
