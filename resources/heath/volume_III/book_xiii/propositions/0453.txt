Since AB has been cut in extreme and mean ratio at C,
therefore the rectangle AB, BC is equal to the square on AC.
[vi. Def. 3, vi. 17]

And CE is the rectangle AB, BC. and CH the square
an AC;
therefore CE is equal to HC.
But HE is equal to CE,
and DH is equal to HC;
therefore DH is also equal to HE.
Therefore the whole DK is equal to the whole AE.
A n d DK is the rectangle BD, DA,
for AD is equal to DL ;
and AE is the square on AB ;
therefore the rectangle BD, DA is equal to the square
on AB.
Therefore, as DB is to BA, so is BA to AD.
[vi. 17]
And DB is greater than BA ;
therefore BA is also greater than AD.
[v. 14]
Therefore DB has been cut in extreme and mean ratio at
A, and AB is the greater segment.
Q. E. D.


We have

(sq. DH) = (sq. HC)
= (rect. CE), by hypothesis,
= (rect. HE).
Add to each side the rectangle AK, and
(rect. DK) = (sq. AE),
or
(rect. BD, DA) = (sq. on AB).
The result is of course obvious from 11. 11.
There is an alternative proof given in P after xm. 6, which depends on
Book v.
By hypothesis,
BA : AC = AC . CB,
or, inversely,
A C : AB = CB : A C.
Component,
(AB + AC): AB = AB : AC,
or
DB : BA = BA : AD.

If a rational straight line be cut in extreme and mean ratio,
each of the segments is the irrational straight line called
apotome.
