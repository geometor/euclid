But the whole AC was also proved equal to the whole BE;
therefore the remainder EC is also equal to the remainder EE.
But CD is also equal to DE.
Therefore the two sides EC, CD are equal to the two
sides EE,
ED;
and the base ED is common to them ;
therefore the angle ECD is equal to the angle FED.
[i. 8]
But the angle BCA was also proved equal to the angle
AEB;
therefore the whole angle BCD is also equal to the whole
angle A ED.
But, by hypothesis, the angle BCD is equal to the angles
at A, B;
therefore the angle AED is also equal to the angles at A, B.
Similarly we can prove that the angle CDE is also equal
to the angles at A, B, C;
therefore the pentagon A BCDE is equiangular.
Next, let the given equal angles not be angles taken in
order, but let the angles at the points A, C, D be equal;
I say that in this case too the pentagon A BCDE is equiangular.
For let BD be joined.
Then, since the two sides BA, AE are equal to the two
sides BC, CD,
and they contain equal angles,
therefore the base BE is equal to the base BD,
the triangle ABE is equal to the triangle BCD,
and the remaining angles will be equal to the remaining angles,
namely those which the equal sides subtend ;
[i. 4]
therefore the angle AEB is equal to the angle CDB.
But the angle BED is also equal to the angle BDE,
since the side BE is also equal to the side BD.

'Therefore the whole angle AED is equal to the whole

But the angle CDE is, by hypothesis, equal to the angles

therefore the angle AED is also equal to the angles at A, C.
