For the same reason
the angle ABC is also equal to the angles at A, C, D.
Therefore the pentagon A BCDE is equiangular.
Q. E. D.


D.

This proposition is required in xm. 17.
The steps of the proof may be shown thus.
I. Suppose that the angles at A, B, C are all equal.
Then the isosceles triangles BAE, ABC are equal in all respects;
thus

BE = AC,

LBCA

= LBEA,

LCAB

=

LEBA.

By the last equality,
BA = BB,
so that, since BE = AC,
BC= BE.
The A s BED, BCD are now equal in all respects,
[1. 8, 4]
and
L BCD = L BED.
But
LACB = L AEB, from above,
whence, by addition,
L BCD - L AED.
Similarly it may be proved that L CDE is also equal to any one of the
angles at A, B, C.
II. Suppose the angles at A, C, D to be equal.
Then the isosceles triangles ABE, CBD are equal in all respects, and
hence BE = BD (so that L BDE = i. BED),
and
L CDB = L. AEB.
By addition of the equal angles,
LCDE

=

LDEA.

Similarly it may be proved that L ABC is also equal to each of the angles
at A, C, D.
PROPOSITION

8.

If in an equilateral and equiangular pentagon straight
lines subtend two angles taken in order, they cut one another
in extreme and mean ratio, and their greater segments are equal
to the side of the pentagon.
For in the equilateral and equiangular pentagon ABCDE
let the straight lines AC, BE, cutting
one another at the point H, subtend
two angles taken in order, the angles
at A, B;
I say that each of them has been
cut in extreme and mean ratio at
the point H, and their greater seg­
ments are equal to the side of the
pentagon.
For let the circle ABCDE
be
circumscribed about the pentagon ABCDE.
