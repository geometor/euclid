Then, since the two straight lines EA, AB are equal to
the two AB, BC,
and they contain equal angles,
therefore the base BE is equal to the base A C,
the triangle ABE is equal to the triangle ABC,
and the remaining angles will be equal to the remaining angles
respectively, namely those which the equal sides subtend. [\. $\
Therefore the angle BAC is equal to the angle ABE;
therefore the angle A HE is double of the angle BAH. [i. 32]
But the angle EAC is also double of the angle BAC,
inasmuch as the circumference EDC is also double of the
circumference CB ;
[m. 28, vi. 33]
therefore the angle HAE is equal to the angle A HE;
hence the straight line HE is also equal to EA, that is, to AB.
And, since the straight line BA is equal to AE,
the angle ABE is also equal to the angle AEB.
[1. 5]
But the angle ABE was proved equal to the angle BAH;
therefore the angle BE A is also equal to the angle BA H.
And the angle ABE is common to the two triangles ABE
and ABH;
therefore the remaining angle BAE is equal to the remaining
angle AHB;
[1.32]
therefore the triangle ABE is equiangular with the triangle
ABH;
therefore, proportionally, as EB is to BA, so is AB to BH.
[vi. 4]

But BA is equal to EH;
therefore, as BE is to EH, so is EH to HB.
And BE is greater than EH;
therefore EH is also greater than HB.
[v. 14]
Therefore BE has been cut in extreme and mean ratio at
H, and the greater segment HE is equal to the side of the
pentagon.
Similarly we can prove that AC has also been cut in
extreme and mean ratio at H, and its greater segment CH
is equal to the side of the pentagon.
