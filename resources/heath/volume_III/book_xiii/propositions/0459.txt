In order to prove this theorem we have to show (i) that the A s AEB,
HAB are similar, and (2) that EH= EA (= AB).
To prove (2) we have
A s AEB, BAC equal in all respects,
whence
EB -AC,
and

LBAC

Therefore

=

LABE.

L A HE = 2 L BAC
=

so that

LEAC,

£H=£A
= AB.

To prove (1) we have, in the A s AEB, HAB,
LBAH

= LEBA
= L AEB,

and
L A BE is common ,
therefore the third L S AHB, EAB are equal,
and
A s AEB, HAB are similar.
Now, since these triangles are similar,
EB

: BA = BA : BH,

or

(rect. EB, BH) = (sq. on BA)
= (sq. on EH),
so that EB is divided in extreme and mean ratio at H.
Similarly its equal, CA, is divided in extreme and mean ratio at H.
PROPOSITION

9.

If the side of the hexagon and that of the decagon inscribed
in the same circle be added together, the whole straight line
has been cut in extreme and mean ratio, and its greater segment
is the side of the hexagon.
Let ABC be a circle ;
of the figures inscribed in the circle ABC let BC be the side
of a decagon, CD that of a hexagon,
and let them be in a straight line ;
I say that the whole straight line
BD has been cut in extreme and
mean ratio, and CD is its greater
segment.
For let the centre of the circle,
the point E, be taken,
let EB, EC, ED be joined,
and let BE be carried through to A.
D
Since BC is the side of an equilateral decagon,
