therefore the circumference ACB is five times the circum­
ference BC;
therefore the circumference AC is quadruple of CB.
But, as the circumference AC is to CB, so is the angle
A EC to the angle CEB;
[vi. 33]
therefore the angle A EC is quadruple of the angle CEB.
And, since the angle EBC is equal to the angle ECB, [1. 5]
therefore the angle A EC is double of the angle ECB.
[1. 32]
And, since the straight line EC is equal to CD,
for each of them is equal to the side of the hexagon inscribed
in the circle ABC,
[iv. 15, Por.]
the angle CED is also equal to the angle CDE;
[1. 5]
therefore the angle ECB is double of the angle EDC.
[1. 32]
But the angle A EC was proved double of the angle ECB;
therefore the angle A EC is quadruple of the angle EDC.
But the angle AEC was also proved quadruple of the
angle BEC;
therefore the angle EDC is equal to the angle BEC.
But the angle EBD is common to the two triangles BEC
and BED;
therefore the remaining angle BED is also equal to the
remaining angle ECB ;
[1. 32]
therefore the triangle EBD is equiangular with the triangle
EBC.
Therefore, proportionally, as DB is to BE, so is EB to BC.
[vi- 4]

But EB is equal to CD.
Therefore, as BD is to DC, so is DC to CB.
And BD is greater than DC;
therefore DC is also greater than CB.
Therefore the straight line BD has been cut in extreme
and mean ratio, and DC is its greater segment.
Q. E. D.


BC is the side of a regular decagon inscribed in the circle; CD is the
side of the inscribed regular hexagon, and is therefore equal to the radius BE
or EC.
Therefore, in order to prove our theorem, we have only to show that the
triangles EBC, DBE are similar.
