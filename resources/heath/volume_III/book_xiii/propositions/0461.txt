Since BC is the side of a regular decagon,
(arc BCA) = 5 (arc BC),
so that
(arc CFA) m 4 (arc BC),
whence
But
Therefore

LECB=2UBEC

(1).

But, since CD = CE,
so that

LCDE
LECB

= LCED,
= 2L CDE.

It follows from (1) that
LBEC=LCDE.
Now, in the A s EBC, DBE,
and
so that

LBEC=
LBDE,
LEBC
is common,
LECB = LDEB,

and

A s EBC, DBE are similar.
DB : BE = EB : BC,
or
(rect. DB, BC) = (sq. on EB)
= (sq. on CD),
and DB is divided at C in extreme and mean ratio.
To find the side of the decagon algebraically in terms of the radius we
have, if x be the side required,
( )x = r ,
Hence

r + x

PROPOSITION 

I O .

If an equilateral pentagon be inscribed in a circle, the
square on the side of the pentagon is equal to the squares on
the side of the hexagon and on that of the decagon inscribed in
the same circle.
Let ABCDE be a circle,
and let the equilateral pentagon ABCDE be inscribed in the
circle ABCDE.
I say that the square on the side of the pentagon ABCDE
is equal to the squares on the side of the hexagon and on
that of the decagon inscribed in the circle ABCDE.
For let the centre of the circle, the point F, be taken,
let AF be joined and carried through to the point G,
let FB be joined,
let FH be drawn from ^perpendicular to AB and be carried
through to K,
