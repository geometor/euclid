let AK, KB be joined,
let FL be. again drawn from F perpendicular to AK, and be
carried through to M,
and let KN be joined.
Since the circumference
ABCG is equal to the circum­
ference AEDG,
and in them ABC is equal to
AED,
therefore the remainder, the
circumference CG, is equal to
the remainder GD.
But CD belongs to a pen­
tagon ;
therefore CG belongs to a
decagon.
And, since FA is equal to EB,
and EH is perpendicular,
therefore the angle AFK is also equal to the angle KEB.
[i. s, i. 26]

Hence the circumference AK is also equal to KB ; [111. 26]
therefore the circumference AB is double of the circumference
BK;
therefore the straight line AK is a side of a decagon.
AK

For the same reason
is also double of KM.

Now, since the circumference AB is double of the circum­
ference BK,
while the circumference CD is equal to the circumference AB,
therefore the circumference CD is also double of the circum­
ference BK.
But the circumference CD is also double of CG ;
therefore the circumference CG is equal to the circumference
BK.
But BK is double of KM, since KA is so also ;
therefore CG is also double of KM.
