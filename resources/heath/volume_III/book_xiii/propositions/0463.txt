But, further, the circumference CB is also double of the
circumference BK,
for the circumference CB is equal to BA.
Therefore the whole circumference GB is also double
of BM;
hence the angle GFB is also double of the angle BFM. [vi. 33]
But the angle GFB is also double of the angle FAB,
for the angle FAB is equal to the angle ABF.
Therefore the angle BFN is also equal to the angle FAB.
But the angle ABF is common to the two triangles ABF
and BFN;
therefore the remaining angle AFB is equal to the remaining
angle BNF;
[1. 3 ]
therefore the triangle ABF is equiangular with the triangle
BFN.
Therefore, proportionally, as the straight line AB is to BF,
so is FB to BN;
[vi. 4]
therefore the rectangle AB, BN is equal to the square on BF.

Again, since AL is equal to LK,
while LN is common and at right angles,
therefore the base KN is equal to the base AN;
therefore the angle LKN is also equal to the angle

[1. 4]
LAN.

But the angle LAN is equal to the angle KBN;
therefore the angle LKN is also equal to the angle KBN.
And the angle at A is common to the two triangles A KB
and AKN.
Therefore the remaining angle AKB
is equal to the
remaining angle KNA ;
[1. 32]
therefore the triangle KBA is equiangular with the triangle
KNA.
Therefore, proportionally, as the straight line BA is to
AK, so is KA to AN;
[vi. 4]
therefore the rectangle BA, AN is equal to the square on AK.
[vi- 17]

But the rectangle AB, BN was also proved equal to the
square on BF;
