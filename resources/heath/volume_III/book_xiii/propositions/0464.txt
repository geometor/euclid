therefore the rectangle AB, BN together with the rectangle
BA, AN, that is, the square on BA [it 2], is equal to the
square on BF together with the square on AK.
A n d BA is a side of the pentagon, BF of the hexagon
[iv. 15, Por.], and AK of the decagon.
Therefore etc.
Q. E. D.


ABCDE
being a regular pentagon inscribed in a circle, and AG the
diameter through A, it follows that
(arc CG) = (arc GD),
and CG, GD are sides of an inscribed regular decagon.
FHK being drawn perpendicular to AB, it follows, by 1. 26, that
L s AFK, BEK axe equal, and BK, KA are sides of the regular decagon.
Similarly it may be proved that, ELM being perpendicular to AK,
AL = LK,

and

(arc AM) = (arc MK).
The main facts to prove are that
(1) the triangles ABF, FBN are similar, and (2) the triangles ABK, AKN
are similar.
(1)

2 (arc c G ) = (arc CD)
= (arc AB)
= 2 (arc BK),

or

(arc CG) = (arc BK) = (arc AK)
= 2 (arc KM).
And
(arc CB) = 2 (arc AST).
Therefore, by addition,
(arc BCG) = 2 (arc BKM).
Therefore
L BFG = 2L BFN.
But
L BFG =2L BAB,
so that
L FAB = L BEN.
Hence, in the A s ABF, FBN,
L FAB = L BFN,
and
i. ABF is common;
therefore
L AFB = L BNF,
and A s ABF, FBN are similar.
(2) Since AL = LK, and the angles at L are right,
AN=NK,

and

t TVX^ = L NAK
=

LKBA.

Hence, in the A s ABK, AKN,
^ABK=LAKN,

and
L KAN is common,
whence the third angles are equal;
therefore the triangles ABK, AKN axe similar.
