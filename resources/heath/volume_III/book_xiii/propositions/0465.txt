Now from the similarity of A s ABF, FBN it follows that
AB : BB= BB: BN,
or
(rect. AB, BN) = (sq. on BF).
And, from the similarity of ABK, AKN,
BA : AK= AK: AN,
or
(rect. BA, AN) = (sq. on AK).
Therefore, by addition,
(rect. AB, BN) + (rect. BA, AN) = (sq. on BF) + (sq. on AK),
that is,
(sq. on AB) = (sq. on BF) + (sq. on AK).
If r be the radius of the circle, we have seen (xm. 9, note) that

AK=- U -i).

PROPOSITION

II.

If in a circle which has its diameter rational an equilateral
pentagon be inscribed, the side of the pentagon is the irrational
straight line called minor.
For in the circle ABCDE which has its diameter rational
let the equilateral pentagon ABCDE be inscribed ;
I say that the side of the pentagon is the irrational straight
line called minor.
For let the centre of the circle, the point F, be taken,
let AF, EB be joined and carried through to the points, G, H,
let AC be joined,
and let EK be made a fourth part of AF.
Now AF is rational ;
therefore EK is also rational.
But BF is also rational;
therefore the whole BK is rational.
And, since the circumference A CG is equal to the circum­
ference ADG,
and in them ABC is equal to AED,
therefore the remainder CG is equal to the remainder GD.
