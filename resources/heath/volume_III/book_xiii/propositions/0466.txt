And, if we join AD, we conclude that the angles at L
are right,
and CD is double of CL.
For the same reason
the angles at M are also right,
and AC is double of CM.

Since then the angle ALC is equal to the angle AMF,
and the angle LAC is common to the two triangles ACL
and AMF,
therefore the remaining angle ACL is equal to the remaining
angle MFA ;
[i. 32]
therefore the triangle ACL is equiangular with the triangle
AMF;
therefore, proportionally, as LC is to CA, so is MF to FA.
And the doubles of the antecedents may be taken ;
therefore, as the double of LC is to CA, so is the double of
MFlo
FA.
But, as the double of MF is, to FA, so is MF to the half
of FA ;
therefore also, as the double of LC is to CA, so is MF to the
half of FA.
And the halves of the consequents may be taken ;
therefore, as the double of LC is to the half of CA, so is MF
to the fourth of FA.
