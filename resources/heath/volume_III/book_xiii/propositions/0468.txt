But, if from a rational straight line there be subtracted a
rational straight line which is commensurable with the whole
in square only, the remainder is irrational, namely an apotome;
therefore MB is an apotome and MK the annex to it. [x. 73]
I say next that MB is also a fourth apotome.
Let the square on N be equal to that by which the square
on BK is greater than the square on KM;
therefore the square on BK is greater than the square on KM
by the square on N.
And, since KF is commensurable with FB,
componendo also, KB is commensurable with FB.
[x. 15]
But BF is commensurable with BH;
therefore BK is also commensurable with BH.
[x. ]
And, since the square on BK is five times the square
on KM,
therefore the square on BK has to the square on KM the
ratio which 5 has to 1.
Therefore, convertendo, the square on ^ A ' h a s to the square
on N the ratio which 5 has to 4 [v. 19, Por.], and this is not the
ratio which a square number has to a square number ;
therefore BK is incommensurable with N;
[x. 9]
therefore the square on BK is greater than the square on KM
by the square on a straight line incommensurable with BK.

Since then the square on the whole BK is greater than
the square on the annex KM by the square on a straight line
incommensurable with BK,
and the whole BK is commensurable with the rational straight
line, BH, set out,
therefore MB is a fourth apotome.
[x. Deff. m. 4]
But the rectangle contained by a rational straight line and
a fourth apotome is irrational,
and its square root is irrational, and is called minor.
[x. 94]
But the square on AB is equal to the rectangle HB BM,
because, when AH is joined, the triangle ABH is equiangular
with the triangle ABM, and, as HB is to BA, so is AB
to BM.
