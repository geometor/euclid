Therefore the side AB
straight line called minor.

of the pentagon is the irrational
Q. E. D.


Here we require certain definitions and propositions of Book x.
First we require the definition of an apotome [see x. 73], which is a straight
line of the form (p ~ Jh. p), where p is a " rational" straight line and k is any
integer or numerical fraction, the square root of which is not integral or
expressible in integers. The lesser of the straight lines p, \jk. p is the annex.
Next we require the definition of the fourth apotome [x. l)eff. 111. (after
x. 84)], which is a straight line of the form (x-y), where x, y (being both
rational and comme
able in square only) are also such that Jx -y is
incommensurable wiu. x, while x is commensurable with a given rational
straight line p. As shown on x. 88 (note), the fourth apotome is of the form

Lastly the minor (straight line) is the irrational straight line defined in
X. 76. It is of the form (x —y), where x, y are incommensurable in square,
and (x +y') is ' rational,' while xy is ' medial.' As shown in the note on
x. 76, the minor irrational straight line is of the form

The proposition may be put as follows. ABCDE being a regular
pentagon inscribed in a circle, AG, BH trie diameters through A, B meeting
CD in L and AC in M respectively, EK is made equal to \AF.
Now, the radius AE(r) being rational, so are EK, BK.
The arcs CG, GD are equal;
hence L. S at L are right, and CD = 2 CL
Similarly L S at Mare right, and AC =2CM.
We have to prove
(1) that BM is an apotome,
(2) that BM is a fourth apotome,
(3) that BA is a minor irrational straight line.
Remembering that, if CA is divided in extreme and mean ratio, the
greater segment is equal to the side of the pentagon [xm. 8], and that accord
ingly [xm. 1] (CD + \CA)' = $ (\CA) , we work towards a proportion con­
taining the ratio (CD + CM) : CM , thus.
The A s ACL, ABM are equiangular and therefore similar.
Therefore
LC.CA = ME: BA,
and accordingly
2LC: CA = ME: \FA ;
thus
2LC:\CA = MF: \FA,
or
DC:CM=ME:FK;
whence, eomponendo, and squaring,
(DC + CM) : CM = MK : KB .
But
(DC+ CM)' = s CM ;
therefore
MJC = 5KB .
