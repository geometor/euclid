It follows that, KF being rational, MK', and therefore MK, is rational.
(1) To prove that BM is an apotome and .^fA" its annex.
We have
AF*4/^;
therefore
BK= $FK,
BK*=2 FK*
= $MK*, from above;
therefore BK' has not to J J / A ' the ratio of a square number to a square
number;
therefore BK, MK are incommensurable in length.
They are therefore rational and commensurable in square only;
accordingly BM is an apotome.

Consequently

BK- MK =

(2) To prove that BM is a fourth apotome.
First, since
.#5 are commensurable,
BK, BF are commensurable, i.e. BK is commensurable with BH, a given
rational straight line.
Secondly, if
N' = BK' - KM',
since
BK* : KM* - 5 : 1,
it follows that
BK* : N' = 5 : 4,
whence i?A!", iV are incommensurable.
Therefore
is a fourth apotome.
(3) To prove that 2?.4 is a minor irrational straight line.
If a fourth apotome form a rectangle with a rational straight line, the side
of the square equivalent to the rectangle is minor [x. 94].
Now
BA' = HB. BM,
HB is rational, and BM is a fourth apotome;
therefore BA is a minor irrational straight line.
[_BA = r ^ . J ^ - ^ =

If this is separated into the difference between two straight lines, we have

If an equilateral triangle be inscribed in a circle, the square
on the side of the triangle is triple of the square on the radius
of the circle.
