Let the diameter AB of the given sphere be set out,
and let it be cut at the point C so that A C is double of CB ;
let the semicircle ADB be described on AB,
let CD be drawn from the point C at right angles to AB,
and let DA be joined ;
let the circle EFG which has its radius equal to DC be
set out,
let the equilateral triangle EFG be inscribed in the circle EFG,
[iv. 2]

let the centre of the circle, the point H, be taken,
[m. 1]
let EH, HF, HG be joined ;
from the point H let HK be set up at right angles to the plane
of the circle EFG,
[xi. 12]
let HK equal to the straight line AC be cut off from HK,
and let KE, KF, KG be joined.

Now, since KH is at right angles to the plane of the
circle EFG,
therefore it will also make right angles with all the straight
lines which meet it and are in the plane of the circle EFG.
[xi. Def. 3]

But each of the straight lines HE, HF, HG meets it :
therefore HK is at right angles to each of the straight lines
HE, HF, HG.
And, since A C is equal to HK, and CD to HE,
and they contain right angles,
therefore the base DA is equal to the base KE.
