For the same reason
each of the straight lines KF, KG is also equal to DA ;
therefore the three straight lines KE, KF, KG are equal to
one another.
And, since AC is double of CB,
therefore AB is triple of BC.
But, as AB is to BC, so is the square on AD to the square
on DC, as will be proved afterwards.
Therefore the square on AD is triple of the square on DC.
But the square on FE is also triple of the square on EH,
[xm. 12]
and DC is equal to EH;
therefore DA is also equal to EF.
But DA was proved equal to each of the straight lines
KE, KF, KG;
therefore each of the straight lines EF, FG, GE is also equal
to each of the straight lines KE, KF, KG;
therefore the four triangles EFG, KEF, KFG, KEG are
equilateral.
Therefore a pyramid has been constructed out of four
equilateral triangles, the triangle EFG being its base and the
point K its vertex.
It is next required to comprehend it in the given sphere
and to prove that the square on the diameter of the sphere
is one and a half times the square on the side of the pyramid.
For let the straight line HL be produced in a straight
line with KH,
and let HL be made equal to CB.
Now, since, as A C is to CD, so is CD to CB, [vi. 8, Por.]
while AC is equal to KH, CD to HE, and CB to HL,
therefore, as KH is to HE, so is EH to HL ;
therefore the rectangle KH, HL is equal to the square on
[vi. 17]
EH.
And each of the angles KHE. EHL is right;
therefore the semicircle described on KL will pass through
[cf. vi. 8, m. 31]
£ also.
