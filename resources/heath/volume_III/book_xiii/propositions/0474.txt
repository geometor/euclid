If then, KL remaining fixed, the semicircle be carried round
and restored to the same position from which it began to be
moved, it will also pass through the points F, G,
since, if FL, LG be joined, the angles at F, G similarly become
right angles;
and the pyramid will be comprehended in the given sphere.
For KL, the diameter of the sphere, is equal to the
diameter AB of the given sphere, inasmuch as KH was
made equal to AC, and HL to CB.
I say next that the square on the diameter of the sphere
is one and a half times the square on the side of the
pyramid
For, since AC is double of CB,
therefore AB is triple of BC;
and, convertendo, BA is one and a half times AC.
But, as BA is to AC, so is the square on BA to the square
on AD.
Therefore the square on BA is also one and a half times
the square on AD.
And BA is the diameter of the given sphere, and AD is
equal to the side of the pyramid.
Therefore the square on the diameter of the sphere is
one and a half times the square on the side of the pyramid.
Q. E. D.

LEMMA.

It is to be proved that, as AB is to BC, so is the square
on AD to the square on DC.
D
For let the figure of the semi­
circle be set out,
let DB be joined,
let the square EC be described
on AC,
and let the parallelogram FB be
completed.
Since then, because the tri­
angle DAB is equiangular with
the triangle DAC,
as BA is to AD, so is DA to A C,
