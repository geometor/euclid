therefore the rectangle BA, AC is equal to the square on AD.
[vi. 17]
And since, as AB is to BC, so is EB to BE,
[vi. 1 ]
and EB is the rectangle BA, AC, for EA

is equal to AC,

and BE is the rectangle A C, CB,
therefore, as AB is to BC, so is the rectangle BA, AC to the
rectangle ^ 4 C , Ci?.
And the rectangle BA, AC is equal to the square on
and the rectangle AC, CB to the square on DC,

AD,

for the perpendicular DC is a mean proportional between the
segments AC, CB of the base, because the angle ADB is
right.
[vi. 8, Por.]
Therefore, as AB
the square on DC.

is to BC, so is the square on AD

Q. E. D.


The Lemma is with reason suspected. Euclid commonly takes more
difficult theorems for granted in the stereometrical Books. It is also clumsy
in itself, while, from a gloss in the proposition rejected as an interpolation, it
is clear that the interpolator of the gloss had not the Lemma. With the
Lemma should disappear the words " as will be proved afterwards " (p. 469).
In the figure of the proposition, the semicircle really represents half of
a section of the sphere through its centre and one edge of the inscribed
tetrahedron (AD being the length of that edge).
The proof is in three parts, the object of which is to prove
(1) that KEFG is a tetrahedron with all its edges equal to AD,
(2) that it is inscribable in a sphere of diameter equal to AB,
(3) that
AB* = %AD*.
To prove (1) we have to show
(a) that
KE = KF= KG = AD,
(b) that
AD = EF.
(a) Since
HE = HE= HG = CD,
KH=AC,
and
L s A CD, KHE, KHF, KHG are right,
A s A CD, KHE, KHF, KHG are equal in all respects;
therefore
KE = KF= KG = AD.
(b) Since
AB = 3BC,
and
AB : BC= AB. AC: AC. CB
=• AD*: CD*,
it follows that
AD* = 3CD*.
But [xm. 12]
EF' = 3EH';
and EH= CD, by construction
