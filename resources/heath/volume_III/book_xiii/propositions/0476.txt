Therefore
AD = EF.
Thus EFGK is a regular tetrahedron.
(2) We now observe the usefulness of Euclid's description of a sphere
[in xi. Def. 14].
Producing KH{=AC) to L so that HL = CB,
we have KL equal to AB;
thus KL is a diameter of the sphere which should circumscribe our tetra­
hedron,
and we have only to prove that E, B, G lie on semicircles described on 'KL
as diameter.
E.g. for the point E,
since
AC: CD= CD : CB,
while
AC=KH, CD = HE, CB = HL,
we have
KH: HE = HE : HL,
or
KH. HL = HE',
whence, the angles KHE, EHL being right,
EKL is a triangle right-angled at E [cf. vi. 8].
Hence E lies on a semicircle on KL as diameter.
Similarly for F, G.
Thus a semicircle on KL as diameter revolving round KL passes
successively through E, F, G.
AB=iBC;
BA = \AC.
BA.AC^BA'-.BA.AC
= BA*:AD\
Therefore
BA' = \AD'.
If r be the radius of the circumscribed sphere,
2 12
(edge of tetrahedron) = —7— . r =

It will be observed that, although in these cases Euclid's construction is
equivalent to inscribing the particular regular solid in a given sphere, he does
not actually construct the solid in the sphere but constructs a solid which a
sphere equal to the given sphere will circumscribe. Pappus, on the other
hand, in dealing with the same problems, actually constructs the respective
solids in the given spheres. His method is to find circular sections in the
given spheres containing a certain number of the angular points of the given
solids. His solutions are interesting, although they require a knowledge of
some properties of a sphere which are of course not found in the Elements
but belonged to treatises such as the Sphaerica of Theodosius.

In order to inscribe a regular pyramid or tetrahedron in a given sphere,
Pappus (in. pp. 142—144) finds two circular sections equal and parallel to one
another, each of which contains one of two opposite edges as its diameter. In
this and the other similar problems he proceeds in the orthodox manner by
