this case.

The following is a reproduction of his solution of

Analysis.
Suppose the problem solved, A, B, C, D being the angular points of the
required pyramid.
Through A draw EF parallel to CD; this will make equal angles with
AC, AD; and, since AB does so too, EF
is perpendicular to AB [Pappus has a lemma
for this, p. 140, 12—24], and is therefore a
tangent to the sphere (for EF is parallel to
CD, the base of the triangle A CD, and
therefore touches the circle circumscribing
it, while it also touches the circular section
AB made by the plane passing through AB
and ZT-r perpendicular to it).
Similarly GH drawn through D parallel
to AB touches the sphere.
And the plane through GH, CD makes
a circular section equal and parallel to AB.
Through the centre AT of that circular
section, and in the plane of the section, draw LM perpendicular to CD and
therefore parallel to AB. Join BL, BM.
BM is then perpendicular to AB, LM, and LB is a diameter of the sphere.
Join MC.
Then
LM*=2MC*,
and
BC = AB = LM,
so that
BC*=2MC*.
And BM, being perpendicular to the plane of the circle LM, is perpen­
dicular to CM,
whence
BC* = BM* + MC*,
so that
BM= MC.
But
BC= LM;
therefore
LM* = 2BMK
And, since the angle LMB is right,
BL'=LM* + MB* = £ LM*.
Synthesis.
Draw two parallel circular sections of the sphere with diameter a",
such that
a"* = y*,
where d is the diameter of the sphere.
[This is easily done by dividing BL, any diameter of the sphere, at B, so
that LB= 2BB, and then drawing PM at right angles to LB meeting the
great circle LMB of the sphere in M. Then LM*: LB* = LP: LB = 2 : 3.]
Draw sections through M, B perpendicular to MB, and in these sections
respectively draw the parallel diameters LM, AB.
Lastly, in the section LM draw CD through the centre K perpendicular
to LM.
ABCD is then the required regular pyramid or tetrahedron.
