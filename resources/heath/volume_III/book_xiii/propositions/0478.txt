PROPOSITION

as in the preceding case; and to prove that the square on the
diameter of the sphere is double of the square on the side of the
octahedron.
Let the diameter AB of the given sphere be set out,
and let it be bisected at C;
let the semicircle ADB be described on AB,
let CD be drawn from C at right angles to A B,
let DB be joined ;
let the square EFGH, having each of its sides equal to DB,
be set out,
let HF, EG be joined,
from the point A ' l e t the straight line KL be set up at rigat
angles to the plane of the square EFGH [xi. 12], and let it be
carried through to the other side of the plane, as KM;
from the straight lines KL, KM let KL, KM be respectively
cut off equal to one of the straight lines EK, FK, GK, HK,
and let LE, LF, LG, LH, ME, MF, MG, MH be joined.

Then, since KE is equal to KH,
and the angle EKH is right,
therefore the square on HE is double of the square on EK.

Again, since LK is equal to KE,
and the angle LKE is right,
therefore the square on EL is double of the square on EK.
