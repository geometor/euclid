But, as AB is to BC, so is the square on AB to the square
on BD;
therefore the square on AB is double of the square on BD.
But the square on LM was also proved double of the
square on LE.
And the square on DB is equal to the square on LE, for
EH was made equal to DB.
Therefore the square on AB is also equal to the square
on LM;
therefore AB is equal to LM.
And AB is the diameter of the given sphere ;
therefore LM is equal to the diameter of the given sphere.
Therefore the octahedron has been comprehended in the
given sphere, and it has been demonstrated at the same time
that the square on the diameter of the sphere is double of the
square on the side of the octahedron.
Q . E . o.
I think the accompanying figure will perhaps be clearer than that in
Euclid's text.
EBGH being a square with side equal to BD, it follows that KE, KF,
KG, KH are all equal to CB.

So are KL, KM, by construction ;
hence LE, LF, LG, LH and ME, MF, MG, MHare all equal to EF or BD.
Thus (1) the figure is made up of eight equilateral triangles and is therefore
a regular octahedron.
(2) Since
KE - KL = KM,
the semicircle on LM in the plane LKE passes through E.
Similarly F, G, HWe. on semicircles on LM as diameter.
Thus all the vertices of the tetrahedron lie on the sphere of which LM is
a diameter.
(3)
LE = EM= BD;
therefore
LM* = 2ED = 2BD'
= AB\
or
LM=AB.
