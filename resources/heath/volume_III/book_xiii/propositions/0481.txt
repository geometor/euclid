Pappus (111. pp. 148—150) finds the two equal and parallel sections of the
sphere which circumscribe two opposite faces of the octahedron thus.
Analysis.
Suppose the octahedron inscribed, A, B, C; £>, E, F being the vertices.
Through ABC, DEF describe planes
making the circular sections ABC, DEF.
Since the straight lines DA, DB, DE, DF
are equal, the points A, E,F, B lie on a circle
of which D is the pole.
Again, since AB, BF, EE, EA are equal,
ABBE is a square inscribed in the said circle,
and AB, EFsxe. parallel.
Similarly DE is parallel to BC, and DF
to AC.
Therefore the circles through D, E, Fax\A
A, B, C are parallel; and they are also equal
because the equilateral triangles inscribed in
them are equal.
Now, ABC, DEFbeing equal and parallel circular sections, and AB, EF
equal and parallel chords " not on the same side of the centres,"
AF is a diameter of the sphere.
[Pappus has a lemma for this, pp. 136—138].
And AE = EF, so that AF* = 2FE*.
But, if d' be the diameter of the circle DEF,
d'* = $EF*.
[cf. xm. 12]
Therefore, if d be the diameter of the sphere,
d*:d" = l-.2.
Now d is given, and therefore d' is given; hence the circles DEF, ABC
are given.
Synthesis.
Draw two equal and parallel circular sections with diameter d', such that

Inscribe an equilateral triangle ABC in either circle (ABC).
In the other circle draw EF equal and parallel to AB but on the opposite
side of the centre, and complete the inscribed equilateral triangle DEF.
ABCDEFis the octahedron required.
It will be observed that, whereas in the problem of x m . 13 Euclid first
finds the circle circumscribing a face and Pappus first finds an edge, in this
problem Euclid finds the edge first and Pappus the circle circumscribing
a face.
