PROPOSITION 

1 5 .

To construct a cube and comprehend it in a sphere, like the
pyramid; and to prove that the square on the diameter of the
sphere is triple of the square on the side of the cube.
Let the diameter AB of the given sphere be set out,
and let it be cut at C so that A C is double of CB;
let the semicircle ADB be described on AB,
let CD be drawn from C at right angles to AB,
and let DB be joined ;
let the square EFGH having its side equal to DB be set out,
from E, F, G, H let EK, EL, GM, HN be drawn at right
angles to the plane of the square EFGH,
from EK, EL, GM, HN let EK, EL, GM, HN respectively
be cut off equal to one of the straight lines EE, EG,
GH, HE,
and let KL, LM, MN, NK be joined ;
therefore the cube FN has been constructed which is contained
by six equal squares.

It is then required to comprehend it in the given sphere,
and to prove that the square on the diameter of the sphere is
triple of the square on the side of the cube.
For let KG, EG be joined.
Then, since the angle KEG is right, because KE is also
at right angles to the plane EG and of course to the straight
line EG also,
[xi. Def. 3]
therefore the semicircle described on KG will also pass through
the point E.
Again, since GF is at right angles to each of the straight
lines EL, EE,
GF is also at right angles to the plane FK;
hence also, if we join FK, GF will be at right angles to FK;
