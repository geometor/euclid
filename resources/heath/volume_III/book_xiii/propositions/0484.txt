Thus, KEG being a right angle, E lies on a semicircle with diameter KG.
The same thing is proved in the same way of the other vertices
E, H, L, M, N.
Thus the cube is inscribed in the sphere of which KG is a diameter.
KG* = KE* + EG*
= KE* + 2EB*
= 3EK*.
AB = iBC,
Also
while
:BC = AB*: AB. BC
= AB*: BD* j
AB* = iBD*.
therefore
BD = EK;
But
KG = AB.
therefore
AB' = iBD*

In this case too Pappus (til. pp. 144—148) gives the full analysis and

Analysis.
Suppose the problem solved, and let the vertices of the cube be
A, B, C, D, E, E, G, H.
Draw planes through A, B, C, D and
E, F, G, H respectively; these will produce
parallel circular sections, which are also equal
since the inscribed squares are equal.
And CE will be a diameter of the sphere.
Join EG.
Now, since EG* = 2EH* - 2GC,
and the angle CGE is right,
CE* = GC*+ EG* = §£G*.
But CE* is given;
therefore EG* is given, so that the circles
EFGH, ABCD, and the squares inscribed in them, are given
Synthesis.
Draw two parallel circular sections with equal diameters a", such that
d*=%a"*,
where d is the diameter of the given sphere.
Inscribe a square in one of the circles, as ABCD.
In the other circle draw EG equal and parallel to BC, and complete the
square on BG inscribed in the circle EFGH.
The eight vertices of the required cube are thus determined.
