Let the diameter AB of the given sphere be set out,
and let it be cut at C so that AC is quadruple of CB,
let the semicircle ADB be described on AB,
let the straight line CD be drawn from C at right angles
to AB,
and let DB be joined ;

let the circle EFGHK be set out and let its radius be equal
to DB,
let the equilateral and equiangular pentagon EFGHK
be
inscribed in the circle EFGHK,
let the circumferences EF, EG, GH, HK, KE be bisected at
the points L, M, N, O, P,
