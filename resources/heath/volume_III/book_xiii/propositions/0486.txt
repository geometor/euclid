Therefore the pentagon LMNOP is also equilateral,
and the straight line EP belongs to a decagon.
Now from the points E, E, G, H, K let the straight lines
EQ, EE, GS, HT, KU be set up at right angles to the plane
of the circle, and let them be equal to the radius of the circle
EFGHK,
let QR, RS, ST, TU, UQ, QL, LR, RM, MS, SN, NT,
TO, OU, UP, PQ be joined.
Now, since each of the straight lines EQ, KU is at right
angles to the same plane,
therefore EQ is parallel to KU.
[xi. 6]
But it is also equal to it;
and the straight lines joining those extremities of equal and
parallel straight lines which are in the same direction are equal
and parallel.
[1. 33]
Therefore Q U is equal and parallel to EK.
But EK belongs to an equilateral pentagon ;
therefore QU&\so belongs to the equilateral pentagon inscribed
in the circle EFGHK.
For the same reason
each of the straight lines QR, RS, ST, TU also belongs to
the equilateral pentagon inscribed in the circle
EFGHK;
therefore the pentagon QRSTU is equilateral.
And, since QE belongs to a hexagon,
and EP to a decagon,
and the angle QEP is right,
therefore QP belongs to a pentagon ;
for the square on the side of the pentagon is equal to the
square on the side of the hexagon and the square on the side
of the decagon inscribed in the same circle.
[xm. 10]
For the same reason
PU is also a side of a pentagon.
But Q U also belongs to a pentagon ;
therefore the triangle QPU is equilateral.
For the same reason
each of the triangles QLR, RMS, SNT,
lateral.

TO U is also equi­
