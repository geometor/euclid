And, since each of the straight lines QL, QP was proved
to belong to a pentagon,
and LP also belongs to a pentagon,
therefore the triangle QLP is equilateral.
For the same reason
each of the triangles LRM,
lateral.

MSN,

NTO,

OUP is also equi­

Let the centre of the circle EFGHK.
the point V, be
taken;
from V let VZ be set up at right angles to the plane of the
circle,
let it be produced in the other direction, as VX,
let there be cut off VW, the side of a hexagon, and each of
the straight lines VX, WZ, being sides of a decagon,
and let QZ, Q W, UZ, EV, LV, LX, XM be joined.
Now, since each of the straight lines VW, QE is at right
angles to the plane of the circle,
therefore VW is parallel to QE.
[xi. 6]
But they are also equal ;
therefore EV, QWare also equal and parallel.
[1. 33]
But E V belongs to a hexagon ;
therefore Q W also belongs to a hexagon.
And, since Q W belongs to a hexagon,
and WZ to a decagon,
and the angle Q WZ is right,
therefore QZ belongs to a pentagon.
[xm. 10]
For the same reason
UZ also belongs to a pentagon,
inasmuch as, if we join VK, WU, they will be equal and
opposite, and VK, being a radius, belongs to a hexagon ;
[iv. 15, Por.]

therefore WU also belongs to a hexagon.
But WZ belongs to a decagon,
and the angle U WZ is right;
therefore UZ belongs to a pentagon.
But Q U also belongs to a pentagon ;
therefore the triangle QUZ is equilateral.
