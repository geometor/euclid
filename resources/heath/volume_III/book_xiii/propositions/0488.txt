For the same reason
each of the remaining triangles of which the straight lines
QR, RS, ST, TU are the bases, and the point Z the vertex,
is also equilateral.
Again, since VL belongs to a hexagon,
and VX to a. decagon,
and the angle L VX is right,
therefore LX belongs to a pentagon.

[xm. 10]

For the same reason,
if we join MV, which belongs to a hexagon,
MX is also inferred to belong to a pentagon.
But LM also belongs to a pentagon;
therefore the triangle LMX is equilateral.
Similarly it can be proved that each of the remaining
triangles of which MN, NO, OP, PL are the bases, and the
point X the vertex, is also equilateral.
Therefore an icosahedron has been constructed which is
contained by twenty equilateral triangles.
•

It is next required to comprehend it in the given sphere,
and to prove that the side of the icosahedron is the irrational
straight line called minor.
For, since VW belongs to a hexagon,
and WZ to a decagon,
therefore VZ has been cut in extreme and mean ratio at W,
and VW is its greater segment;
[xm. 9]
therefore, an ZVis to VW, so is VWto WZ.
But VWis equal to VE, and WZ to VX;
therefore, as ZV is to VE, so is EV to VX.
And the angles Z VE, E VX are right;
therefore, if we join the straight line EZ, the angle XEZ
will be right because of the similarity of the triangles XEZ,
VEZ.
For the same reason,
since, as ZVis to VW, so is VW to WZ,
and ZV is equal to XW, and VWto WQ,
therefore, as XW is to WQ, so is QW to WZ.
