And for this reason again,
if we join QX, the angle at Q will be right;
[vi. 8]
therefore the semicircle described on XZ will also pass
through Q,
[m. 31]
And if, XZ remaining fixed, the semicircle be carried
round and restored to the same position from which it began
to be moved, it will also pass through Q and the remaining
angular points of the icosahedron,
and the icosahedron will have been comprehended in a
sphere.
I say next that it is also comprehended in the given sphere.
For let VW be bisected at A'.
Then, since the straight line VZ has been cut in extreme
and mean ratio at W,
and ZW is its lesser segment,
therefore the square on ZW added to the half of the greater
segment, that is WA', is five times the square on the half
of the greater segment;
[xm. 3]
therefore the square on ZA' is five times the square on
A'W.
And ZX is double of ZA', and r e d o u b l e of A'W;
therefore the square on ZX is five times the square on
WV.
And, since AC is quadruple of CB,
therefore AB is five times BC.
But, as A B is to BC, so is the square on AB to the square
on BD ;
[vi. 8, v. Def. 9]
therefore the square on AB is five times the square on BD.
But the square on ZX was also proved to be five times
the square on VW.
And DB is equal to VW,
for each of them is equal to the radius of the circle EFGHK;
therefore AB is also equal to XZ.
And AB is the diameter of the given sphere;
therefore XZ is also equal to the diameter of the given sphere.
Therefore the icosahedron has been comprehended in the
given sphere
