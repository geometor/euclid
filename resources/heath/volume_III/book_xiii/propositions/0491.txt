BD is the radius of the circular sections containing the pentagons.
[If r is the radius of the sphere,
since
AB : BC=AB': AB. BC
= AB':BD',
while
AB= $£C,
it follows that
AB' = $BD\
or
(radius of section)' = $r*.

Thus [xm. 10, note] (side of pentagon) = - (10 - 2,^/5).]

Inscribe the regular pentagon EBGHK in the circle EFGHK of radius
equal to BD.
Bisect the arcs EF, EG,
so forming a decagon in the circle.
Joining successive points of bisection, we obtain another regular pentagon
LMNOB.
LMNOP is one of the pentagons containing five edges of the icosahedron.
The other circle and inscribed pentagon are obtained by drawing perpen­
diculars from E, F, G, H, K to the plane of the circle, as EQ, FB, GS,
HT, KU, and making each of these perpendiculars equal to the radius of the
circle, or, as Euclid says, the side of the regular hexagon in it.
QRSTU is the second pentagon (of course equal to the first) containing five,
edges of the icosahedron.
Joining each angular point of one of the two pentagons to the two nearest
angular points in the other pentagon, we complete ten triangles each of which
has for one side a side of one or other of the two pentagons.
V, W are the centres of the two circles, and VW is of course perpen­
dicular to the planes of both.
(2) Produce VW in both directions, making VX and WZ both equal to
a side of the regular decagon in the circle (as EL).
Joining X, Z to the angular points of the corresponding pentagons, we
