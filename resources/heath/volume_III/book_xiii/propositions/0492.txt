have five more triangles formed with the sides of each pentagon as bases, ten
more triangles in all.
Now we come to the proof.
(3) Taking two adjacent perpendiculars, EQ, KU, to the plane of the circle
EFGHK, we sea that they are parallel as well as equal;
therefore QU, EK are equal and parallel.
Similarly for QR, EF etc.
Thus the pentagons have their sides equal.
To prove that the triangles QPL etc., are equilateral, we have, e.g.
QL* = LE* + EQ*
= (side of decagon) + (side of hexagon)
= (side of pentagon) ,
[xm. 10]
i.e.
QZ = ^side of pentagon in circle)
= LP.
Similarly
QP = LP,
and
A QPL is equilateral.
So for the other triangles between the two pentagons.
(4) Since VW, EQ are equal and parallel,
VE, WQ are equal and parallel.
Thus WQ is equal to the side of a regular hexagon in the circles.
Now the angle ZWQ is right;
therefore
ZQ* = ZW"- + WQ*
= (side of decagon) + (side of hexagon)
= (side of pentagon) .
[xm. 10]
Thus ZQ, ZR, ZS, ZT, ZU are all equal to QR, RS etc.; and the
triangles with Z as vertex and bases QR, RS etc. are equilateral.
Similarly for the triangles with X as vertex and LM, MN etc. as bases.
Hence the figure is an icosahedron, being contained by twenty equal
equilateral triangles.
(5) To prove that all the vertices of the icosahedron lie on the sphere
which has XZ for diameter.
VW being equal to the side of a regular hexagon, and WZ to the side of
a regular decagon inscribed in the same circle,
KZis divided at Win extreme and mean ratio.
[xm. 9]
Therefore
ZV: VW = VW : WZ,
or, since
VW = VE, WZ= VX,
ZV: VE= VE : VX.
Thus E lies on the semicircle on ZX as diameter.
[vi. 8]
Similarly for all the other vertices of the icosahedron.
Hence the sphere with diameter XZ circumscribes it.
(6) To prove XZ--AB.
Since VZ is divided in extreme and mean ratio at W, and VW is
bisected at A',
A'Z* = sA'W*.
[xm. 3]
Taking the doubles of A'Z, A' W, we have
XZ*= VW*
