" rational" in Euclid's sense.
Hence the side of the inscribed pentagon is the irrational straight line
called minor.

Pappus' solution.

This solution (Pappus, m. pp. 150—6) differs considerably from that of
Euclid. Whereas Euclid uses two circular sections of the sphere (thosecircumscribing the pentagons of his construction), Pappus finds four parallel
circular sections each passing through three of the vertices of the icosahedron;
two of the circles are small circles circumscribing two opposite triangular
faces respectively, and the other two circles are between these two circles,
parallel to them and equal to one another.
Analysts.
Suppose the problem solved, the vertices of the icosahedron being A, B, C;
D, E, F; G, H, K; L, M, N.
Since the straight lines BA, BC, BF, BG, BE drawn from B to the
surface of the sphere are equal,
A, C, F, G, E are in one plane.
And AC, CE, EG, GE, EA are equal;
therefore ACFGE is an equilateral and equiangular pentagon.
So are the figures KEBCD, DHFBA, AKLGB, AKNHC, and
CHMGB.
