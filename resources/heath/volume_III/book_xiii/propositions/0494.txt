Now AC will be parallel to EF (in the pentagon ACFGE) and to KH
(in the pentagon AKNHC), so that EF, KH axe also parallel;
and further KH is parallel to LM (in the pentagon LKDHM).

•

Similarly BC, ED, GH, LN axe all parallel;
and likewise BA, ED, GK, MNaxe all parallel.
Since BC is equal and parallel to LN, and BA to MN, the circles ABC,
LMN axe equal and parallel.
Similarly the circles DEF, KGH axe equal and parallel; for the triangles
inscribed in them are equal (since each of the sides in both is the chord
subtending an angle of equal pentagons), and their sides are parallel re­
spectively.
Now in the equal and parallel circles DEF, KGH the chords EF, KH
are equal and parallel, and on opposite sides of the centres;
therefore FK is a diameter of the sphere [Pappus' lemma, pp. 136—8], and the
angle FEKis right [Pappus' lemma, p. 138, 20—26].
[The diameter FK is not actually drawn in the figure.]
In the pentagon GEA CF, if EF be divided in extreme and mean ratio,
the greater segment is equal to AC.
[Eucl. xm. 8]
Therefore EF: AC= (side of hexagon) : (side of decagon in same circle).
[xm. 9]
And
EF> + AC' = EE* + EK* = d°,
where d is the diameter of the sphere.
Thus FK, EF, A C are as the sides of the pentagon, hexagon and decagon
respectively inscribed in the same circle.
[xm. 10]
But FK, the diameter of the sphere, is given ;
therefore EF, AC axe given respectively;
thus the radii of the circles EFD, ACB are given (if r, / are their radii,
t* = \EF*,r" = \AC).
