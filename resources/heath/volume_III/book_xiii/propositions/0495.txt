Hence the circles are given •
and so are the circles KHG, LMN which are equal and parallel to them
respectively.
Synthesis.
If d be the diameter of the sphere, set out two straight lines x, y, such
that d, x, y are in the ratio of the sides of the pentagon, hexagon and decagon
respectively inscribed in one and the same circle.
Draw (i) two equal and parallel circular sections in the sphere, with radii
equal to r, where r* = \x*, as DEF, KGH,
and (a) two equal and parallel circular sections as ABC, LMN, with radius r
such that r'' = j y .
In the circles (i) draw EF, KHas sides of inscribed equilateral triangles,
parallel to one another, and on opposite sides of the centres;
and in the circles (2) draw AC, LM as sides of inscribed equilateral triangles
parallel to one another and to EF, KH, and so that AC, EFaxe on opposite
sides of the centres, and likewise KH, LM.
Complete the figure.
The correctness of the construction is proved as in the analysis.
It follows also (says Pappus) that
(diam. of sphere) = 3 (side of pentagon in DEF)*.
For, by construction,
KF: EE =p : h,
where / , h are the sides of the pentagon and hexagon inscribed in the same
circle DEF.
And FE : h = the ratio of the side of an equilateral triangle to that of a
hexagon inscribed in the same circle;
that is,
FE : h= J3 : 1,
whence
KF: p = J3 : 1,
or
KF* = 3 / .

A n o t h e r construction.

Mr H. M. Taylor has a neat construction for an icosahedron of edge a.
Let / be the length of the diagonal of a regular pentagon with side equal
to a.
Then (figure of xm. 8), by Ptolemy's theorem,
P = la + a*.
Construct a cube with edge equal to /.
Let O be the centre of the cube.
From 0 draw OL, OM, CW perpendicular to three adjacent faces, and in
these draw BP, QQ, BK parallel to AB, AD, AE respectively.
Make LB, LP', MQ, MQ, NB, NB! all equal to ha.
Let / , / ' , q, q, r, r' be the reflexes of P, P', Q, Q', B, R' respectively.
Then will B, B', Q, Q, R, A", p, p', q, q, r, r be the vertices of a regular
icosahedron.
The projections of BQ on AB, AD, AE are equal to J (I—a), \a, \l
respectively.
Therefore
BQ* = \ (1'-a)' + {a* + \P
= i(/*~ai + a')
= d*.
