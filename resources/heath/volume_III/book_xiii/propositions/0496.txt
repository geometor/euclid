Therefore
PQ = a.
Similarly it may be proved that every other edge is equal to a.
All the angular points lie on a sphere with radius OP, and
OP = \{a + P).

Each solid pentahedral angle is composed of five equal plane angles, each
ot which is the angle of an equilateral triangle.
Therefore the icosahedron is regular.
[d = 40P*-l\
And, from the equation P = la + a*, we derive

Therefore, if r b e the radius of the sphere,
