[xm. 17

Then, since the straight line NP has been cut in extreme
and mean ratio at R,
and RP is the greater segment,
therefore the squares on PN, NR are triple of the square
on RP.
[xm. J
But PN is equal to NB, and PR to RU;
therefore the squares on BN, NR are triple of the square
on RU.
But the square on BR is equal to the squares on BN, NR;

['• 47]

therefore the square on BR is triple of the square on RU;
hence the squares on BR, RU are quadruple of the square
on RU.
But the square on B U is equal to the squares on BR, R U;
therefore the square on BUis quadruple of the square on RU;
therefore BU is double of RU.
But VU is also double of UR,
inasmuch as SR is also double of PR, that is, of RU;
therefore BU is equal to UV.
Similarly it can be proved that each of the straight lines
BW, JVC, CV is also equal to each of the straight lines
BU, UV
Therefore the pentagon BUVCW'is equilateral.
I say next that it is also in one plane.
For let PX be drawn from P parallel to each of the
straight lines RU, SV and towards the outside of the cube,
and let XH, HW be joined ;
I say that XHWis a straight line.
For, since HQ has been cut in extreme and mean ratio at
T, and Q T is its greater segment,
therefore, as HQ is to QT, so is QT to TH.
But HQ is equal to HP, and QT to each of the straight
lines TW, PX;
therefore, as HP is to PX, so is WT to TH.
A n d HP is parallel to TW,
for each of them is at right angles to the plane BD;
[xi. 6]
and TH is parallel to PX,
for each of them is at right angles to the plane BF.
