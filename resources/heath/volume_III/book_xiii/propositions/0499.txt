But if two triangles, as XPH, HTIV, which have two
sides proportional to two sides be placed together at one
angle so that their corresponding sides are also parallel,
the remaining straight lines will be in a straight line; [vi. 32]
therefore XH is in a straight line with HJV.
But every straight line is in one plane ;
[xi. 1]
therefore the pentagon UB JVC V is in one plane.
I say next that it is also equiangular.
For, since the straight line NP has been cut in extreme
and mean ratio at R, and PR is the greater segment,
while PR is equal to PS,
therefore NS has also been cut in extreme and mean ratio
at P,
[xm. ]
and NP is the greater segment;
therefore the squares on NS, SP are triple of the square
[xm. 4]
on NP.
But NP is equal to NB, and PS to SV;
therefore the squares on NS, SV are triple of the square
on NB;
hence the squares on VS, SN, NB are quadruple of the square
on NB.
But the square on SB is equal to the squares on SN, NB;
therefore the squares on BS, S V, that is, the square on B V
s

therefore VB is double of BN.
But BC is also double of BN;
therefore BV is equal to BC.
And, since the two sides BU, UV are equal to the two
sides BW, JVC,
and the base BV is equal to the base BC,
therefore the angle BUV is equal to the angle BJVC.
[1. 8]
Similarly we can prove that the angle UVC is also equal
to the angle B JVC;
therefore the three angles BJVC, BUV, UVC are equal to
one another.
