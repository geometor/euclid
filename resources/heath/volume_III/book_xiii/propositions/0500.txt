But if in an equilateral pentagon three angles are equal to
one another, the pentagon will be equiangular,
[xm. 7]
therefore the pentagon BUVCW'is
equiangular.
And it was also proved equilateral;
therefore the pentagon BUVCW is equilateral and equi­
angular, and it is on one side BC of the cube.
Therefore, if we make the same construction in the case
of each of the twelve sides of the cube,
a solid figure will have been constructed which is contained
by twelve equilateral and equiangular pentagons, and which is
called a dodecahedron.
It is then required to comprehend it in the given sphere,
and to prove that the side of the dodecahedron is the irrational
straight line called apotome.
For let XP be produced, and let the produced straight
line be XZ;
therefore PZ meets the diameter of the cube, and they bisect
one another,
for this has been proved in the last theorem but one of the
eleventh book.
[xi. 38]
Let them cut at Z;
therefore Z is the centre of the sphere which comprehends
the cube,
and ZP is half of the side of the cube.
Let UZ be joined.
Now, since the straight line NS has been cut in extreme
and mean ratio at P,
and NP is its greater segment,
therefore the squares on NS, SP are triple of the square
on NP.
[xm. 4]
But NS is equal to XZ,
inasmuch as NP is also equal to PZ, and XP to PS.
But further PS is also equal to XU,
since it is also equal to RP;
therefore the squares on ZX, XU are triple of the square
on NP.
But the square on UZ is equal to the squares on ZX, XU;
therefore the square on UZ is triple of the square on NP.
