But the square on the radius of the sphere which compre­
hends the cube is also triple of the square on the half of the
side of the cube,
for it has previously been shown how to construct a cube and
comprehend it in a sphere, and to prove that the square on
the diameter of the sphere is triple of the square on the side
of the cube.
[xm. 15]
But, if whole is so related to whole, so is half to half also;
and NP is half of the side of the cube ;
therefore UZ is equal to the radius of the sphere which com­
prehends the cube.
And Z is the centre of the sphere which comprehends the
cube ;
therefore the point U is on the surface of the sphere.
Similarly we can prove that each of the remaining angles
of the dodecahedron is also on the surface of the sphere ;
therefore the dodecahedron has been comprehended in the
given sphere.
I say next that the side of the dodecahedron is the irrational
straight line called apotome.
For since, when NP has been cut in extreme and mean
ratio, RP is the greater segment,
and, when PO has been cut in extreme and mean ratio, PS
is the greater segment,
therefore, when the whole NO is cut in extreme and mean
ratio, RS is the greater segment.
[Thus, since, as NP is to PR, so is PR to RN,
the same is true of the doubles also,
for parts have the same ratio as their equimultiples ;
[v. 15]
therefore as NO is to RS, so is RS to the sum of NR, SO.
But NO is greater than RS;
therefore RS is also greater than the sum of NR, SO;
therefore NO has been cut in extreme and mean ratio,
and RS is its greater segment.]
But RS is equal to UV;
therefore, when NO is cut in extreme and mean ratio, UV is
the greater segment
