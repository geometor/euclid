(4) that the vertex U is on the sphere which circumscribes the cube, and
hence
(5) that all the other vertices lie on the same sphere,
and (6) that the side of the dodecahedron is an apotome.
(1) To prove that the pentagon BUVCW is equilateral.
We have
BU* = BR* + RU'
= (BN' + NB ) + BP*
= (PN* + NR*) + RP'
= $RP' + RP'
= RP'
= UV.
Therefore
BU= UV.

Similarly it may be proved that BW, WC, CV are all equal to UV
or BU.
[Mr Taylor proceeds in this way. With his notation, the projections of
BU on BA, BC, BE are respectively \a, \ (I-a), \l.
Therefore
BtP-\*

\{l-eit+\P

= a'.
Similarly for BW, WC etc.]
(2) To prove that the pentagon BUVCW is in one plane.
Draw BX parallel to BUox S V meeting UV'm X.
Join XH, HW.
