Then we have to prove that XH, HW are in one straight line.
Now HB, WT, being both perpendicular to the face BD, are parallel.
For the same reason XB, HT are parallel.
Also, since QHis divided at Tin extreme and mean ratio,
QH: QT= QT: TH.
And
QH= HP, QT= WT= PX.
Therefore
HB : BX = WT: TH.
Consequently the triangles HPX, WTH satisfy the conditions of vi. 32;
hence XHW is a straight line.
[Mr Taylor proves this as follows :
The projections of WH, WX on BE are \a and \ (a +1),
and the projections of WH, WX on BA are \(l-a) and \l;
and
a : (a + /) = (/ - a) : I,
since
al = P - a*.
Therefore WHX is a straight line.]
(3) To prove that the pentagon BUVCW'is equiangular.
We have
BV* = BS* + SV
= (BN* + NS*) + SB
= BN* + (NS* + SP*)
= PN* + 3 PN\
since NS is divided in extreme and mean ratio at P [xm. 5], so that
1

NS* + SP* = 3PN*.

Consequently

or

[xm. 4]

BV* = 4PN*

= BC*,
BV=BC.
The A s UBV, WBCaie therefore equal in all respects,

and
Similarly

LBUV=

LBWC.

LCVU^

LBWC.

Therefore the pentagon is equiangular.

[xm. 7]

(4) To prove that the sphere which circumscribes the cube also circum­
scribes the dodecahedron we have only to prove that, if Z be the centre of
the sphere, ZU = ZB, for example.
Now, by xi. 38, XP produced meets the diagonal of the cube, and the
portion of XP produced which is within the cube and the diagonal bisect
one another.
And
ZU* = ZX* + XU*
= NS*+PS
t

as before.
Also (cf. xm. 15)
ZB*=>ZP* + PB>
= ZP* + PN* + NB*
= 3 PN*.
ZU= ZB.

Hence

Similarly for ZV, ZWetc.
