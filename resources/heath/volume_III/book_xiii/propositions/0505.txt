Since PN is divided in extreme and mean ratio at B,
NP:PR = PR: RN.
Doubling the terms, we have
NO:RS~RS:
(NR + SO),
so that, if NO is divided in extreme and mean ratio, the greater segment
is equal to RS.
Now, since the diameter of the sphere is rational,
and
(diam. of sphere) = 3 (edge of cube) ,
the edge of the cube (i.e. NO) is rational.
Consequently RS is an apotome.
[This is proved in the spurious XIII. 6 above; Euclid assumes it, and the
words purporting to quote the theorem are probably interpolated, like xm. 6
itself.]
As a matter of fact, with Mr Taylor's notation,
/ = la + a ,

Pappus' solution.
Here too Pappus (ill. pp. 156—162) finds four circular sections of the
sphere all parallel to one another and all passing through five of the vertices
of the dodecahedron.

Analysis.
Suppose (he says) the problem solved, and let the vertices of the
dodecahedron be A, B, C, Z>, E; F, G, H, K, L; M, N, O, P, Q;
R, S, T, U, V.
Then, as before, ED is parallel to EL, and AE to EG; therefore the
planes ABCDE, FGHKL are parallel.
But, since BA is parallel to BH, and BH to OC, BA is parallel to OC;
and they are equal; therefore PO, AC are parallel, so that ST, ED are also
parallel.
Similarly RS, DC are parallel, and likewise the pairs (TU, EA),
(UV, AB), (VB, BC).
Therefore the planes ABCDE, BSTUV are parallel; and the circles
ABCDE, BSTUV are equal, since the inscribed pentagons are equal.
Similarly the circles FGHKL, MNOBQ are equal, since the pentagons
inscribed in them are equal.
Now CL, OU are parallel beciuse each is parallel to KN;
therefore L, C, 0, U are in one plane.
And LC, CO, OU, UL are all equal, since they subtend angles of equal
pentagons.
Also L, C, O, U are on a plane section, i.e. a circle ;
therefore LCOU is a square.
Therefore
0L' = 2LC*=2 LE
(for LC, LB subtend angles of equal pentagons).
