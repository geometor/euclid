And the angle OLE is right; for PO, LF are equal and parallel chords
in two equal and parallel circular sections of a sphere [Pappus' lemma, p. 138,
20—26].
Therefore
OF* = OL* + FL* = $FL*.
[from above]
And OF is a diameter of the sphere; for PO, FL are on opposite sides
of the centres of the circles in which they are [Pappus' lemma, pp. 136—8].

Now suppose /, h to be the sides of an equilateral pentagon, triangle
and hexagon in the circle FGHKL, d the diameter of the sphere.
Then
d : EL =
:1
[from above]
= t: h;
[Eucl. xm. 12]
and it follows alternando (since FL -p) that
d:t=p-.h.
Now let d', p', h' be the sides of a regular decagon, pentagon and hexagon
respectively inscribed in any one circle.
Since, if FL be divided in extreme and mean ratio, the greater segment is
equal to ED,
[xm. 8]
FL : ED - fi : d".
[vi. Def. 3, xm. 9]
And FL : ED is the ratio of the sides of the regular pentagons inscribed
in the circles FGHKL, ABCDE, and is therefore equal to the ratio of the
sides of the equilateral triangles inscribed in the same circles.
Therefore
/ : (side of A in ABCDE) = K : d'.
But
d:t=p:h
=p':K;
therefore, ex aequali, d : (side of A in ABCDE) = p' : d'.
Now d is given;
therefore the sides of the equilateral triangles inscribed in the circles ABCDE,
FGHKL respectively are given, whence the radii of those circles are also
given.
