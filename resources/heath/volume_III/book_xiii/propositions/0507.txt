Thus the two circles are given, and so accordingly are the equal and
parallel circular sections.
Synthesis.
Set out two straight lines x, y such that d, x, y are in the ratio of the sides
of a regular pentagon, hexagon and decagon respectively inscribed in one and
the same circle.
Find two circular sections of the sphere with radii r, r', where
r> = \x\ r» = \f.
Let these be the circles FGHKL, ABCDE respectively, and draw the
equal and parallel circles on the other side of the centre, namely MNOBQ,
BSTUV.
In the first two circles inscribe regular pentagons with their sides respec­
tively parallel, ED being parallel to BL.
Draw equal and parallel chords (on the other sides of the centres) in the
other two circles, namely ST equal and parallel to ED, and PO equal and
parallel to PL; and complete the regular pentagons on ST, PO inscribed in
the circles.
Thus all the vertices of the dodecahedron are determined.
The proof of the correctness of the construction is clear from the analysis.
Pappus adds that the construction shows that the circles containing five
vertices of the dodecahedron are the same respectively as those containing
three vertices of the icosahedron, and that the same circle circumscribes the
triangle of the icosahedron and the pentagonal face of the dodecahedron in
the same sphere.

PROPOSITION 

1 8 .

To set out the sides of the five figures and to compare them
with one another.
Let AB, the diameter of the given sphere, be set out,
and let it be cut at C so that
AC is equal to CB, and at D
so that AD is double of DB ;
let the semicircle AEB be de­
scribed on AB,
from C, D let CE, DFhe drawn
at right angles to AB,
and let AE, EB, EB be joined.
Then, since AD is double
of DB,
therefore AB is triple of BD.
Convertendo, therefore, BA is one and a half times AD.
