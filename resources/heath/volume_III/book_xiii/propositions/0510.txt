[xin. 18

And, since LB belongs to a decagon, and ML to a
hexagon,,
for ML is equal to KL, since it is also equal to HK, being
the same distance from the centre, and each of the straight
lines HK, KL is double of KC,
therefore MB belongs to a pentagon.
[xm. i o ]
But the side of the pentagon is the side of the icosa­
hedron ;
[xm. 16]
therefore MB belongs to the icosahedron.
Now, since FB is a side of the cube,
let it be cut in extreme and mean ratio at N,
and let NB be the greater segment;
therefore NB is a side of the dodecahedron.
[xm. 17, Por.]
And, since the square on the diameter of the sphere was
proved to be one and a half times the square on the side AF
of the pyramid, double of the square on the side BE of the
octahedron and triple of the side FB of the cube,
therefore, of parts of which the square on the diameter of the
sphere contains six, the square on the side of the pyramid
contains four, the square on the side of the octahedron three,
and the square on the side of the cube two.
Therefore the square on the side of the pyramid is fourthirds of the square on the side of the octahedron, and double
of the square on the side of the cube ;
and the square on the side of the octahedron is one and a half
times the square on the side of the cube.
T h e said sides, therefore, of the three figures, I mean the
pyramid, the octahedron and the cube, are to one another in
rational ratios.
But the remaining two, I mean the side of the icosa­
hedron and the side of the dodecahedron, are not in rational
ratios either to one another or to the aforesaid sides;
for they are irrational, the one being minor [xm. 16] and the.
other an apotome [xm. 17].
That the side MB of the icosahedron is greater than the
side NB of the dodecahedron we can prove thus.
For, since the triangle FDB is equiangular with the
triangle FAB,
[vi. 8]
proportionally, as DB is to BF, so is BF to BA.
