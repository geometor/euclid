And, since the three straight lines are proportional,
as the first is to the third, so is the square on the first to the
square on the second ;
[v. Def. 9, vi. 20, Por.]
therefore, as DB is to BA, so is the square on DB to the
square on BF;
therefore, inversely, as AB is to BD, so is the square on FB
to the square on BD.
But AB is triple of BD ;
therefore the square on FB is triple of the square on BD.
But the square on AD is also quadruple of the square
on DB,
for AD is double of DB ;
therefore the square on AD is greater than the square on FB;
therefore AD is greater than FB ;
therefore AL is by far greater than FB.
And, when AL is cut in extreme and mean ratio,
KL is the greater segment,
inasmuch as LK belongs to a hexagon, and KA to a decagon;
[xm. 9]

and, when FB is cut in extreme and mean ratio, NB is the
greater segment;
therefore KL is greater than NB.
But KL is equal to LM;
therefore LM is greater than NB.
Therefore MB, which is a side of the icosahedron, is by
far greater than NB which is a side of the dodecahedron.
Q. E. D.


I say next that no other figure, besides the said Jive figures,
can be constructed which is contained by equilateral and equi­
angular figures equal to one another.
For a solid angle cannot be constructed with two triangles,
or indeed planes.
With three triangles the angle of the pyramid is constructed,
with four the angle of the octahedron, and with five the angle
of the icosahedron ;
but a solid angle cannot be formed by six equilateral and equi­
angular triangles placed together at one point,
