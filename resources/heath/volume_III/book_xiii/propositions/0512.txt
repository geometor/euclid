for, the angle of the equilateral triangle being two-thirds of a
right angle, the six will be equal to four right angles:
which is impossible, for any solid angle is contained by angles
less than four right angles.
[xi. 21]
For the same reason, neither can a solid angle be con­
structed by more than six plane angles.
By three squares the angle of the cube is contained, but
by four it is impossible for a solid angle to be contained,
for they will again be four right angles.
By three equilateral and equiangular pentagons the angle
of the dodecahedron is contained ;
but by four such it is impossible for any solid angle to be
contained,
for, the angle of the equilateral pentagon being a right angle
and a fifth, the four angles will be greater than four right
angles:
which is impossible.
Neither again will a solid angle be contained by other
polygonal figures by reason of the same absurdity.
Therefore etc.

LEMMA.

But that the angle of the equilateral and equiangular
pentagon is a right angle and a fifth we must prove thus.
Let ABCDE
be an equilateral and equiangular
pentagon,
let the circle ABCDE be cir­
cumscribed about it,
let its centre F be taken,
and let FA, FB, FC, FD, FE
be joined.
Therefore they bisect the
angles of the pentagon at A,
B, C, D, E.
And, since the angles at F
are equal to four right angles
and are equal,
