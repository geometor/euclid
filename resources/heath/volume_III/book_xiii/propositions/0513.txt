therefore one of them, as the angle AFB, is one right angle
less a fifth ;
therefore the remaining angles FAB, ABF consist of one
right angle and a fifth.
But the angle FAB is equal to the angle FBC;
therefore the whole angle ABC of the pentagon consists of
one right angle and a fifth.
Q. E. D.


We have seen in the preceding notes that, if r be the radius of the sphere
circumscribing the five solid figures,
(edge of tetrahedron) = %j6.r,
(edge of octahedron) = J2.r,
(edge of cube) = | ^ 3 • >
r

(edge of icosahedron) = ^ «/io (5 - J5),
(edge of dodecahedron) = ^ ( V i s - ^3)Euclid here exhibits the edges of all the five regular solids in one figure.
(1) Make AD equal to 2DB.
Thus
BA = \AD,
and
BA : AD = BA* : AB*;
therefore
BA* = \AF*.
Thus
AB= J%. 2r = f , / 6 . r = (edge of tetrahedron).
(2)
AB* : BF* = AB : BD
= 3:1.
Therefore
BE* = ^AB*,

or
BE=- .r
= -j3.r=(edgeofcube).

(3)
AB* = 2BE*.
Therefore
BE = ^ 2 . r - (edge of octahedron).
(4) Draw AG perpendicular and equal to AB. Join GC, meeting the
semicircle in H, and draw HK perpendicular to AB.
Then
GA = 2 AC;
therefore, by similar triangles, HK= 2KC.
Hence
HK* = 4KC*,
and therefore
5KC* = HK* + KC*
= HC
= CB*.
Again, since AB = iCB, and AD = 2DB,
by subtraction,
BD = 2DC,
or
BC= 3DC.
