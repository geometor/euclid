Therefore

9DC* = BC*
= $KC*.

Hence KC> CD.
Make CL equal to KC, draw LM at right angles to AB, and join
AM, MB.
Since
CB* = sKC*,
AB = sKL'.

It follows that KL (= J$. r) is the radius of, or the side of the regular
hexagon in, the circle containing the pentagonal sections of the icosahedron.
[xm. 16]
And, since
zr = (side of hexagon) + 2 (side of decagon in same circle)
[xm. 16, Por.]
AK = LB = (side of decagon in the said circle).
But
LM = HK= KL = (side of hexagon in circle).
Therefore LM* + LB (= BM*) = (side of pentagon in circle)*
[xm. 10]
= (edge of icosahedron)',
and
BM= (edge of icosahedron).
[More shortly,
HK= 2KC,
whence
HK* = 4KC*,
and
KC* = HC' = r*.

(5) Cut BB (the edge of the cube) in extreme and mean ratio at N.
Then, if BN be the greater segment,
BN= (edge of dodecahedron).
