(6) If t, o, c are the edges of the tetrahedron, octahedron and cube
respectively,
4r* = \t*=20* = zc*.

If each of these equals is put equal to X,
r* = X,
4

o* = \.X,
= X,
whence
4r* : t* : d* : c* = 6 : 4 : 3 : 2,
and the ratios between tr, t, 0, c are all rational (in Euclid's sense).
The ratios between these and the edges of the icosahedron and the
dodecahedron are irrational.
(7)

To prove that
(edge of icosahedron) > (edge of dodecahedron),
Le. that
MB > NB.
By similar A s FDB, AFB,
DB

:BF=BF:

BA,
1

But

DB : BA = DB : BF*.
2,DB = BA;

therefore
By hypothesis,

BB* = 3DB*.
AD* = 4DB*;

therefore
AD > BF,
and, a fortiori,
AL > BB.
Now LK is the side of a hexagon, and AK the side of a decagon in the
same circle;
therefore, when AL is divided in extreme and mean ratio, KL is the greater
segment.
And, when BF is divided in extreme and mean ratio, BN is the greater
segment.
Therefore, since
AL > BF,
KL > BN,
LM> BN.

or
And therefore, a fortiori,

MB > BN.
