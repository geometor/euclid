       <p>To bisect a given finite straight line.</p>
      </div4>
      <div4 type="Proof">
       <p>Let <emph>AB</emph> be the given finite straight line.</p>
       <p>Thus it is required to bisect the finite straight line <emph>AB</emph>.</p>
       <p>Let the equilateral triangle <emph>ABC</emph> be constructed on it, [<ref target="elem.1.1" targOrder="U">I. 1</ref>] and let the angle <emph>ACB</emph> be bisected by the straight line <emph>CD</emph>; [<ref target="elem.1.9" targOrder="U">I. 9</ref>]</p>
       <p>I say that the straight line <emph>AB</emph> has been bisected at the point <emph>D</emph>.</p>
       <p>For, since <emph>AC</emph> is equal to <emph>CB</emph>, and <emph>CD</emph> is common, <hi rend="center">the two sides <emph>AC</emph>, <emph>CD</emph> are equal to the two sides <emph>BC</emph>, <emph>CD</emph> respectively;</hi> and the angle <emph>ACD</emph> is equal to the angle <emph>BCD</emph>; <hi rend="center">therefore the base <emph>AD</emph> is equal to the base <emph>BD</emph>. [<ref target="elem.1.4" targOrder="U">I. 4</ref>]</hi></p>
       <p>Therefore the given finite straight line <emph>AB</emph> has been bisected at <emph>D</emph>.</p>
