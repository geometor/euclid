      <div4 type="Enunc">
       <p>If two straight lines cut one another, they make the vertical angles equal to one another.</p>
      </div4>
      <div4 type="Proof">
       <p>For let the straight lines <emph>AB</emph>, <emph>CD</emph> cut one another at the point <emph>E</emph>; </p>
       <p>I say that the angle <emph>AEC</emph> is equal to the angle <emph>DEB</emph>, <hi rend="center">and the angle <emph>CEB</emph> to the angle <emph>AED</emph>.</hi>
        </p>
       <p>For, since the straight line <emph>AE</emph> stands <emph>CD</emph>, making the angles <emph>CEA</emph>, <emph>AED</emph>, <hi rend="center">the angles <emph>CEA</emph>, <emph>AED</emph> are equal to two right angles [<ref target="elem.1.13" targOrder="U">I. 13</ref>]</hi>
        </p>
       <p>Again, since the straight line <emph>DE</emph> stands on the straight line <emph>AB</emph>, making the angles <emph>AED</emph>, <emph>DEB</emph>, <hi rend="center">the angles <emph>AED</emph>, <emph>DEB</emph> are equal to two right angles. [<ref target="elem.1.13" targOrder="U">I. 13</ref>]</hi>
        </p>
       <p>But the angles <emph>CEA</emph>, <emph>AED</emph> were also proved equal to two right angles; <hi rend="center">therefore the angles <emph>CEA</emph>, <emph>AED</emph> are equal to the angles <emph>AED</emph>
         <emph>DEB</emph>. [<ref target="elem.1.post.4" targOrder="U">Post. 4</ref> and <ref target="elem.1.c.n.1" targOrder="U">C. N. 1</ref>] Let the angle <emph>AED</emph> be subtracted from each; <emph>CEA</emph> is equal to the remaining angle <emph>BED</emph>. [<ref target="elem.1.c.n.3" targOrder="U">C. N. 3</ref>]</hi></p>
       <p>Similarly it can be proved that the angles <emph>CEB</emph>, <emph>DEA</emph> are also equal.</p>
       <p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D. </p>

       <p>[From this it is manifest that, if two straight lines cut one another, they will make the angles at the point of section equal to four right angles.</p>

       <p>The difference between <emph>adjacent</emph> angles (<foreign lang="greek">αἱ ἐφεξῆς γωνίαι</foreign>) and <emph>vertical</emph> angles (<foreign lang="greek">αἱ κατὰ κορυφὴν γωνίαι</foreign>) is thus explained by Proclus (<xref n="Proc. p. 298, 14-24" from="ROOT" to="DITTO" targOrder="U">p. 298, 14-24</xref>). The first term describes the angles made by two straight lines when one only is divided by the other, i.e. when one straight line meets another at a point which is not either of its extremities, but is not itself produced beyond the point of meeting. When the first straight line <emph>is</emph> produced, so that the lines cross at the point, they make two pairs of <emph>vertical</emph> angles (which are more clearly described as <emph>vertically opposite</emph> angles), and which are so called because their convergence is from opposite directions to one point (the intersection of the lines) as vertex (<foreign lang="greek">κορυφή</foreign>).</p>
