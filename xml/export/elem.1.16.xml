      <head>Proposition 16.</head>
      <div4 type="Enunc">
       <p>In any triangle, if one of the sides be produced, the exterior angle is greater than either of the interior and opposite angles.</p>
      </div4>
      <div4 type="Proof">
       <p>Let <emph>ABC</emph> be a triangle, and let one side of it <emph>BC</emph> be produced to <emph>D</emph>; </p>
       <p>I say that the exterior angle <emph>ACD</emph> is greater than either of the interior and opposite angles <emph>CBA</emph>, <emph>BAC</emph>.</p>
       <p>Let <emph>AC</emph> be bisected at <emph>E</emph> [<ref target="elem.1.10" targOrder="U">I. 10</ref>], and let <emph>BE</emph> be joined and produced <emph>F</emph>; </p>
       <p>let <emph>EF</emph> be made equal to <emph>BE</emph>[<ref target="elem.1.3" targOrder="U">I. 3</ref>], let <emph>FC</emph> be joined [<ref target="elem.1.post.1" targOrder="U">Post. 1</ref>], and let <emph>AC</emph> be drawn through to <emph>G</emph> [<ref target="elem.1.post.2" targOrder="U">Post. 2</ref>].</p>
       <p>Then, since <emph>AE</emph> is equal to <emph>EC</emph>, <emph>BE</emph> to <emph>EF</emph>, <hi rend="center">the two sides <emph>AE</emph>, <emph>EB</emph> are equal to the two sides <emph>CE</emph>, <emph>EF</emph> respectively; and the angle <emph>AEB</emph> is equal to the angle <emph>FEC</emph>, for they are vertical angles. [<ref target="elem.1.15" targOrder="U">I. 15</ref>] <emph>AB</emph> is equal to the base <emph>FC</emph>, and the triangle <emph>ABE</emph> is equal to the triangle <emph>CFE</emph>, and the remaining angles are equal to the remaining angles respectively, namely those which the equal sides subtend; [<ref target="elem.1.4" targOrder="U">I. 4</ref>] therefore the angle <emph>BAE</emph> is equal to the angle <emph>ECF</emph>.</hi>
        </p>
       <p>But the angle <emph>ECD</emph> is greater than the angle <emph>ECF</emph>; [<title>C. N</title>. 5] <hi rend="center">therefore the angle <emph>ACD</emph> is greater than the angle <emph>BAE</emph>.</hi></p>
       <p>Similarly also, if <emph>BC</emph> be bisected, the angle <emph>BCG</emph>, that is, the angle <emph>ACD</emph> [<ref target="elem.1.15" targOrder="U">I. 15</ref>], can be proved greater than the angle <emph>ABC</emph> as well.</p>
       <p>Therefore etc.</p>
