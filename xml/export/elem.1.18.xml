      <head>Proposition 18.</head>
      <div4 type="Enunc">
       <p>In any triangle the greater side subtends the greater angle.</p>
      </div4>
      <div4 type="Proof">
       <p>For let <emph>ABC</emph> be a triangle having the side <emph>AC</emph> greater than <emph>AB</emph>;</p>
       <p>I say that the angle <emph>ABC</emph> is also greater than the angle <emph>BCA</emph>.</p>
       <p>For, since <emph>AC</emph> is greater than <emph>AB</emph>, let <emph>AD</emph> be made equal to <emph>AB</emph> [<ref target="elem.1.3" targOrder="U">I. 3</ref>], and let <emph>BD</emph> bejoined.</p>
       <p>Then, since the angle <emph>ADB</emph> is an exterior angle of the triangle <emph>BCD</emph>, </p>
       <p>it is greater than the interior and opposite angle <emph>DCB</emph>. [<ref target="elem.1.16" targOrder="U">I. 16</ref>]</p>
       <p>But the angle <emph>ADB</emph> is equal to the angle <emph>ABD</emph>, <hi rend="center">since the side <emph>AB</emph> is equal to <emph>AD</emph>; therefore the angle <emph>ABD</emph> is also greater than the angle <emph>ACB</emph>; therefore the angle <emph>ABC</emph> is much greater than the angle <emph>ACB</emph>.</hi></p>
       <p>Therefore etc.</p>

      <note type="crit" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">
       <p>In the enunciation of this number we have <foreign lang="greek">ὑποτείνειν</foreign> (<quote>subtend</quote>
) used with the simple accusative instead of the more usual <foreign lang="greek">ὑπό</foreign> with accusative. The latter construction is used in the enunciation of <ref target="elem.1.19" targOrder="U">I. 19</ref>, which otherwise only differs from that of <ref target="elem.1.18" targOrder="U">I. 18</ref> in the order of the words. The point to remember in order to distinguish the two is that the <foreign lang="la">datum</foreign> comes first and the <foreign lang="la">quaesitum</foreign> second, the <foreign lang="la">datum</foreign> being in this proposition the greater <emph>side</emph> and in the next the greater <emph>angle</emph>. Thus the enunciations are (<ref target="elem.1.18" targOrder="U">I. 18</ref>) <foreign lang="greek">παντὸς τριγώνου ἡ μείζων πλευρὰ τὴν μείζονα γωνίαν ὑποτείνει</foreign> and (<ref target="elem.1.19" targOrder="U">I. 19</ref>) <foreign lang="greek">παντὸς τριγώνου ὑπὸ τὴν μείζονα γωνίαν ἡ μείζων πλευρὰ ὑποτείνει</foreign>. In order to keep the proper order in English we must use the passive of the verb in <ref target="elem.1.19" targOrder="U">I. 19</ref>. Aristotle quotes the result of <ref target="elem.1.19" targOrder="U">I. 19</ref>, using the exact wording, <foreign lang="greek">ὑπὸ γὰρ τὴν μείζω γωνίαν ὑποτείνει</foreign> (<xref n="Aristot. Meteo.. 376a.12" from="ROOT" to="DITTO" targOrder="U"><title>Meteorologica</title> III. 5, 376 a 12</xref>).</p>
