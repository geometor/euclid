       <p>In any triangle the greater angle is subtended by the greater side.</p>
      </div4>
      <div4 type="Proof">
       <p>Let <emph>ABC</emph> be a triangle having the angle <emph>ABC</emph> greater than the angle <emph>BCA</emph>;</p>
       <p>I say that the side <emph>AC</emph> is also greater than the side <emph>AB</emph>.</p>
       <p>For, if not, <emph>AC</emph> is either equal to <emph>AB</emph> or less.</p>
       <p>Now <emph>AC</emph> is not equal to <emph>AB</emph>; for then the angle <emph>ABC</emph> would also have been equal to the angle <emph>ACB</emph>; [<ref target="elem.1.5" targOrder="U">I. 5</ref>] but it is not; <hi rend="center">therefore <emph>AC</emph> is not equal to <emph>AB</emph>.</hi></p>
       <p>Neither is <emph>AC</emph> less than <emph>AB</emph>, for then the angle <emph>ABC</emph> would also have been less than the angle <emph>ACB</emph>; [<ref target="elem.1.18" targOrder="U">I. 18</ref>] but it is not; <hi rend="center">therefore <emph>AC</emph> is not less than <emph>AB</emph>.</hi></p>
       <p>And it was proved that it is not equal either. <hi rend="center">Therefore <emph>AC</emph> is greater than <emph>AB</emph>.</hi></p>
       <p>Therefore etc.</p>
