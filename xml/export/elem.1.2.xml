       <p>To place at a given point (as an extremity) a straight line equal to a given straight line.</p>
      </div4>
      <div4 type="Proof">
       <p>Let <emph>A</emph> be the given point, and <emph>BC</emph> the given straight line.</p>
       <p>Thus it is required to place at the point <emph>A</emph> (as an extremity) <emph>BC</emph>. </p>
       <p>From the point <emph>A</emph> to the point <emph>B</emph> let the straight line <emph>AB</emph> be joined; [<ref target="elem.1.post.1" targOrder="U">Post. 1</ref>] and on it let the equilateral triangle <emph>DAB</emph> be constructed. [<ref target="elem.1.1" targOrder="U">I. 1</ref>]</p>
       <p>Let the straight lines <emph>AE</emph>, <emph>BF</emph> be produced in a straight line with <emph>DA</emph>, <emph>DB</emph>; [<ref target="elem.1.post.2" targOrder="U">Post. 2</ref>] with centre <emph>B</emph> and distance <emph>BC</emph> let the <emph>CGH</emph> be described; [<ref target="elem.1.post.3" targOrder="U">Post. 3</ref>] and again, with centre <emph>D</emph> and distance <emph>DG</emph> let the circle <emph>GKL</emph> be described. [<ref target="elem.1.post.3" targOrder="U">Post. 3</ref>]</p>
       <p>Then, since the point <emph>B</emph> is the centre of the circle <emph>CGH</emph>, <hi rend="center"><emph>BC</emph> is equal to <emph>BG</emph>.</hi>
        </p>
       <p>Again, since the point <emph>D</emph> is the centre of the circle <emph>GKL</emph>, <hi rend="center"><emph>DL</emph> is equal to <emph>DG</emph>.</hi></p>
       <p>And in these <emph>DA</emph> is equal to <emph>DB</emph>; <hi rend="center">therefore the remainder <emph>AL</emph> is equal to the remainder <emph>BG.</emph> [<ref target="elem.1.c.n.3" targOrder="U">C.N. 3</ref>]</hi>
        </p>
       <p>But <emph>BC</emph> was also proved equal to <emph>BG</emph>; <hi rend="center">therefore each of the straight lines <emph>AL</emph>, <emph>BC</emph> is equal to <emph>BG</emph>.</hi></p>
       <p>And things which are equal to the same thing are also equal to one another; [<ref target="elem.1.c.n.1" targOrder="U">C.N. 1</ref>] <hi rend="center">therefore <emph>AL</emph> is also equal to <emph>BC</emph>.</hi></p>
       <p>Therefore at the given point <emph>A</emph> the straight line <emph>AL</emph> is placed equal to the given straight line <emph>BC</emph>.</p>
