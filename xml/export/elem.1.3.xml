       <p>Given two unequal straight lines, to cut off from the greater a straight line equal to the less. </p>
      </div4>
      <div4 type="Proof">
       <p>Let <emph>AB</emph>, <emph>C</emph> be the-two given unequal straight lines, and let <emph>AB</emph> be the greater of them.</p>
       <p>Thus it is required to cut off from <emph>AB</emph> the greater a straight line equal to <emph>C</emph> the less.</p>
       <p>At the point <emph>A</emph> let <emph>AD</emph> be placed equal to the straight line <emph>C</emph>; [<ref target="elem.1.2" targOrder="U">I. 2</ref>] and with centre <emph>A</emph> and distance <emph>AD</emph> let the circle <emph>DEF</emph> be described. [<ref target="elem.1.post.3" targOrder="U">Post. 3</ref>] <hi rend="center">Now, since the point <emph>A</emph> is the centre of the circle <emph>DEF</emph>, <emph>AE</emph> is equal to <emph>AD</emph>. [<ref target="elem.1.def.15" targOrder="U">Def. 15</ref>] But <emph>C</emph> is also equal to <emph>AD</emph>. Therefore each of the straight lines <emph>AE</emph>, <emph>C</emph> is equal to <emph>AD</emph>; so that <emph>AE</emph> is also equal to <emph>C</emph>. [<ref target="elem.1.c.n.1" targOrder="U">C.N. 1</ref>]</hi></p>
       <p>Therefore, given the two straight lines <emph>AB</emph>, <emph>C</emph>, from <emph>AB</emph> the greater <emph>AE</emph> has been cut off equal to <emph>C</emph> the less.</p>
