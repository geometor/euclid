       <p>Through a given point to draw a straight line parallel to a given straight line.</p>
      </div4>
      <div4 type="Proof">
       <p>Let <emph>A</emph> be the given point, and <emph>BC</emph> the given straight line; thus it is required to draw through the point <emph>A</emph> a straight line parallel to the straight line <emph>BC</emph>. </p>
       <p>Let a point <emph>D</emph> be taken at random on <emph>BC</emph>, and let <emph>AD</emph> be joined; on the straight line <emph>DA</emph>, and at the point <emph>A</emph> on it, let the angle <emph>DAE</emph> be constructed equal to the angle <emph>ADC</emph> [<ref target="elem.1.23" targOrder="U">I. 23</ref>]; and let the straight line <emph>AF</emph> be produced in a straight line with <emph>EA</emph>. </p>
       <p>Then, since the straight line <emph>AD</emph> falling on the two straight lines <emph>BC</emph>, <emph>EF</emph> has made the alternate angles <emph>EAD</emph>, <emph>ADC</emph> equal to one another, <hi rend="center">therefore <emph>EAF</emph> is parallel to <emph>BC</emph>. [<ref target="elem.1.27" targOrder="U">I. 27</ref>]</hi></p>
       <p>Therefore through the given point <emph>A</emph> the straight line <emph>EAF</emph> has been drawn parallel to the given straight line <emph>BC</emph>.</p>
