      <head>Proposition 35.</head>
      <div4 type="Enunc">
       <p>Parallelograms which are on the same base and in the same parallels are equal to one another.</p>
      </div4>
      <div4 type="Proof">
       <p>Let <emph>ABCD</emph>, <emph>EBCF</emph> be parallelograms on the same base <emph>BC</emph> and in the same parallels <emph>AF</emph>, <emph>BC</emph>; <emph>ABCD</emph> is equal to the parallelogram <emph>EBCF</emph>.</p>
       <p>For, since <emph>ABCD</emph> is a parallelogram, <hi rend="center"><emph>AD</emph> is equal to <emph>BC</emph>. [<ref target="elem.1.34" targOrder="U">I. 34</ref>]</hi>
        </p>
       <p>For the same reason also <hi rend="center"><emph>EF</emph> is equal to <emph>BC</emph>, <emph>AD</emph> is also equal to <emph>EF</emph>; [<ref target="elem.1.c.n.1" targOrder="U">C.N. 1</ref>]</hi> and <emph>DE</emph> is common; <hi rend="center">therefore the whole <emph>AE</emph> is equal to the whole <emph>DF</emph>. [<ref target="elem.1.c.n.2" targOrder="U">C.N. 2</ref>]</hi></p>
       <p>But <emph>AB</emph> is also equal to <emph>DC</emph>; [<ref target="elem.1.34" targOrder="U">I. 34</ref>] therefore the two sides <emph>EA</emph>, <emph>AB</emph> are equal to the two sides <emph>FD</emph>, <emph>DC</emph> respectively, <hi rend="center">and the angle <emph>FDC</emph> is equal to the angle <emph>EAB</emph>, the exterior to the interior; [<ref target="elem.1.29" targOrder="U">I. 29</ref>] therefore the base <emph>EB</emph> is equal <emph>FC</emph>, and the triangle <emph>EAB</emph> will be equal to the triangle <emph>FDC</emph>. [<ref target="elem.1.4" targOrder="U">I. 4</ref>]</hi></p>
       <p>Let <emph>DGE</emph> be subtracted from each; therefore the trapezium <emph>ABGD</emph> which remains is equal to the trapezium <emph>EGCF</emph> which remains. [<ref target="elem.1.c.n.3" targOrder="U">C.N. 3</ref>] </p>
       <p>Let the triangle <emph>GBC</emph> be added to each; therefore the whole parallelogram <emph>ABCD</emph> is equal to the whole parallelogram <emph>EBCF</emph>. [<ref target="elem.1.c.n.2" targOrder="U">C.N. 2</ref>]</p>
       <p>Therefore etc.</p>

       <p>Euclid speaks of the triangle <emph>DGE</emph> without any explanation that, in the case which he takes (where <emph>AD</emph>, <emph>EF</emph> have no point in common), <emph>BE</emph>, <emph>CD</emph> must meet at a point <emph>G</emph> between the two parallels. He allows this to appear from the figure simply.</p>
