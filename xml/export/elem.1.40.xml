      <head>Proposition 40.</head>
      <p><emph>Equal triangles which are on equal bases and on the same side are also in the same parallels</emph>.</p>
      <p>Let <emph>ABC</emph>, <emph>CDE</emph> be equal triangles on equal bases <emph>BC</emph>, <emph>CE</emph> and on the same side.</p>
      <p>I say that they are also in the same parallels.</p>
      <p>For let <emph>AD</emph> be joined; I say that <emph>AD</emph> is parallel to <emph>BE</emph>.</p>
      <p>For, if not, let <emph>AF</emph> be drawn through <emph>A</emph> parallel to <emph>BE</emph> [<ref target="elem.1.31" targOrder="U">I. 31</ref>], and let <emph>FE</emph> be joined. </p>
      <p>Therefore the triangle <emph>ABC</emph> is equal to the triangle <emph>FCE</emph>; for they are on equal bases <emph>BC</emph>, <emph>CE</emph> and in the same parallels <emph>BE</emph>, <emph>AF</emph>. [<ref target="elem.1.38" targOrder="U">I. 38</ref>]</p>
      <p>But the triangle <emph>ABC</emph> is equal to the triangle <emph>DCE</emph>; <hi rend="center">therefore the triangle <emph>DCE</emph> is also equal to the triangle <emph>FCE</emph>, [<ref target="elem.1.c.n.1" targOrder="U">C.N. 1</ref>] the greater to the less: which is impossible. Therefore <emph>AF</emph> is not parallel to <emph>BE</emph>.</hi>
       </p>
      <p>Similarly we can prove that neither is any other straight line except <emph>AD</emph>; <hi rend="center">therefore <emph>AD</emph> is parallel to <emph>BE</emph>.</hi></p>
      <p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.]</p>
