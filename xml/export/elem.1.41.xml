       <p>If a parallelogram have the same base with a triangle and be in the same parallels, the parallelogram is double of the triangle.</p>
      </div4>
      <div4 type="Proof">
       <p>For let the parallelogram <emph>ABCD</emph> have the same base <emph>BC</emph> with the triangle <emph>EBC</emph>, and let it be in the same parallels <emph>BC</emph>, <emph>AE</emph>;</p>
       <p>I say that the parallelogram <emph>ABCD</emph> is double of the triangle <emph>BEC</emph>.</p>
       <p>For let <emph>AC</emph> be joined.</p>
       <p>Then the triangle <emph>ABC</emph> is equal to the triangle <emph>EBC</emph>; for it is on the same base <emph>BC</emph> with it and in the same parallels <emph>BC</emph>, <emph>AE</emph>. [<ref target="elem.1.37" targOrder="U">I. 37</ref>] </p>
       <p>But the parallelogram <emph>ABCD</emph> is double of the triangle <emph>ABC</emph>; <hi rend="center">for the diameter <emph>AC</emph> bisects it; [<ref target="elem.1.34" targOrder="U">I. 34</ref>]</hi> so that the parallelogram <emph>ABCD</emph> is also double of the triangle <emph>EBC</emph>.</p>
       <p>Therefore etc.</p>
