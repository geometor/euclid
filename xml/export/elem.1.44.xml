       <p>To a given straight line to apply, in a given rectilineal angle, a parallelogram equal to a given triangle.</p>
      </div4>
      <div4 type="Proof">
       <p>Let <emph>AB</emph> be the given straight line, <emph>C</emph> the given triangle and <emph>D</emph> the given rectilineal angle; <emph>AB</emph>, in an angle equal to the angle <emph>D</emph>, a parallelogram equal to the given triangle <emph>C</emph>.</p>
       <p>Let the parallelogram <emph>BEFG</emph> be constructed equal to the triangle <emph>C</emph>, in the angle <emph>EBG</emph> which is equal to <emph>D</emph> [<ref target="elem.1.42" targOrder="U">I. 42</ref>]; <emph>BE</emph> is in a straight line with <emph>AB</emph>; let<emph>FG</emph> be drawn through to <emph>H</emph>, and let <emph>AH</emph> be drawn through <emph>A</emph> parallel to either <emph>BG</emph> or <emph>EF</emph>. [<ref target="elem.1.31" targOrder="U">I. 31</ref>]</p>
       <p>Let <emph>HB</emph> be joined. </p>
       <p>Then, since the straight line <emph>HF</emph> falls upon the parallels <emph>AH</emph>, <emph>EF</emph>, <hi rend="center">the angles <emph>AHF</emph>, <emph>HFE</emph> are equal to two right angles. [<ref target="elem.1.29" targOrder="U">I. 29</ref>]</hi> Therefore the angles <emph>BHG</emph>, <emph>GFE</emph> are less than two right angles; and straight lines produced indefinitely from angles less than <ref target="elem.1.post.5" targOrder="U">Post. 5</ref>] <hi rend="center">therefore <emph>HB</emph>, <emph>FE</emph>, when produced, will meet.</hi></p>
       <p>Let them be produced and meet at <emph>K</emph>; through the point <emph>K</emph> let <emph>KL</emph> be drawn parallel to either <emph>EA</emph> or <emph>FH</emph>, [<ref target="elem.1.31" targOrder="U">I. 31</ref>] and let <emph>HA</emph>, <emph>GB</emph> be produced to the points <emph>L</emph>, <emph>M</emph>. </p>
       <p>Then <emph>HLKF</emph> is a parallelogram, <emph>HK</emph> is its diameter, and <emph>AG</emph>, <emph>ME</emph> are parallelograms. and <emph>LB</emph>, <emph>BF</emph> the so-called complements, about <emph>HK</emph>; <hi rend="center">therefore <emph>LB</emph> is equal to <emph>BF</emph>. [<ref target="elem.1.43" targOrder="U">I. 43</ref>]</hi></p>
       <p>But <emph>BF</emph> is equal to the triangle <emph>C</emph>; <hi rend="center">therefore <emph>LB</emph> is also equal to <emph>C</emph>. [<ref target="elem.1.c.n.1" targOrder="U">C.N. 1</ref>]</hi></p>
       <p>And, since the angle <emph>GBE</emph> is equal to the angle <emph>ABM</emph>, [<ref target="elem.1.15" targOrder="U">I. 15</ref>] <hi rend="center">while the angle <emph>GBE</emph> is equal to <emph>D</emph>, the angle <emph>ABM</emph> is also equal to the angle <emph>D</emph>.</hi></p>
       <p>Therefore the parallelogram <emph>LB</emph> equal to the given triangle <emph>C</emph> has been applied to the given straight line <emph>AB</emph>, in the angle <emph>ABM</emph> which is equal to <emph>D</emph>.</p>
