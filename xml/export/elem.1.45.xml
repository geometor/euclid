       <p>To construct, in a given rectilineal angle, a parallelogram equal to a given rectilineal figure.</p>
      </div4>
      <div4 type="Proof">
       <p>Let <emph>ABCD</emph> be the given rectilineal figure and <emph>E</emph> the given rectilineal angle; <emph>E</emph>, a parallelogram equal to the rectilineal figure <emph>ABCD</emph>. </p>
       <p>Let <emph>DB</emph> be joined, and let the parallelogram <emph>FH</emph> be constructed equal to the triangle <emph>ABD</emph>, in the angle <emph>HKF</emph> which is equal to <emph>E</emph>; [<ref target="elem.1.42" targOrder="U">I. 42</ref>] <emph>GM</emph> equal to the triangle <emph>DBC</emph> be applied to the straight line <emph>GH</emph>, in the angle <emph>GHM</emph> which is equal to <emph>E</emph>. [<ref target="elem.1.44" targOrder="U">I. 44</ref>]</p>
       <p>Then, since the angle <emph>E</emph> is equal to each of the angles <emph>HKF</emph>, <emph>GHM</emph>, <hi rend="center">the angle <emph>HKF</emph> is also equal to the angle <emph>GHM</emph>. [<ref target="elem.1.c.n.1" targOrder="U">C.N. 1</ref>]</hi>
        </p>
       <p>Let the angle <emph>KHG</emph> be added to each; therefore the angles <emph>FKH</emph>, <emph>KHG</emph> are equal to the angles <emph>KHG</emph>, <emph>GHM</emph>.</p>
       <p>But the angles <emph>FKH</emph>, <emph>KHG</emph> are equal to two right angles; [<ref target="elem.1.29" targOrder="U">I. 29</ref>] <emph>KHG</emph>, <emph>GHM</emph> are also equal to two right angles.</p>
       <p>Thus, with a straight line <emph>GH</emph>, and at the point <emph>H</emph> on it, two straight lines <emph>KH</emph>, <emph>HM</emph> not lying on the same side make the adjacent angles equal to two right angles; <hi rend="center">therefore <emph>KH</emph> is in a straight line with <emph>HM</emph>. [<ref target="elem.1.14" targOrder="U">I. 14</ref>]</hi></p>
       <p>And, since the straight line <emph>HG</emph> falls upon the parallels <emph>KM</emph>, <emph>FG</emph>, the alternate angles <emph>MHG</emph>, <emph>HGF</emph> are equal to one another. [<ref target="elem.1.29" targOrder="U">I. 29</ref>]</p>
       <p>Let the angle <emph>HGL</emph> be added to each; <emph>MHG</emph>, <emph>HGL</emph> are equal to the angles <emph>HGF</emph>, <emph>HGL</emph>. [<ref target="elem.1.c.n.2" targOrder="U">C.N. 2</ref>]</p>
       <p>But the angles <emph>MHG</emph>, <emph>HGL</emph> are equal to two right angles; [<ref target="elem.1.29" targOrder="U">I. 29</ref>] therefore the angles <emph>HGF</emph>, <emph>HGL</emph> are also equal to two right angles. [<ref target="elem.1.c.n.1" targOrder="U">C.N. 1</ref>] <hi rend="center">Therefore <emph>FG</emph> is in a straight line with <emph>GL</emph>. [<ref target="elem.1.14" targOrder="U">I. 14</ref>]</hi></p>
       <p>And, since <emph>FK</emph> is equal and parallel to <emph>HG</emph>, [<ref target="elem.1.34" targOrder="U">I. 34</ref>] <hi rend="center">and <emph>HG</emph> to <emph>ML</emph> also,</hi>
        <emph>KF</emph> is also equal and parallel to <emph>ML</emph>; [<ref target="elem.1.c.n.1" targOrder="U">C.N. 1</ref>;<ref target="elem.1.30" targOrder="U"> I. 30</ref>] and the straight lines <emph>KM</emph>, <emph>FL</emph> join them (at their extremities); <emph>KM</emph>, <emph>FL</emph> are also equal and parallel. [<ref target="elem.1.33" targOrder="U">I. 33</ref>] <hi rend="center">Therefore <emph>KFLM</emph> is a parallelogram.</hi></p>
       <p>And, since the triangle <emph>ABD</emph> is equal to the parallelogram <emph>FH</emph>, <hi rend="center">and <emph>DBC</emph> to <emph>GM</emph>,</hi>
        <emph>ABCD</emph> is equal to the whole parallelogram <emph>KFLM</emph>.</p>
       <p>Therefore the parallelogram <emph>KFLM</emph> has been constructed equal to the given rectilineal figure <emph>ABCD</emph>, in the angle <emph>FKM</emph> which is equal to the given angle <emph>E</emph>.</p>
