       <p>On a given straight line to describe a square.</p>
      </div4>
      <div4 type="Proof">
       <p>Let <emph>AB</emph> be the given straight line; thus it is required to describe a square on the straight line <emph>AB</emph>. </p>
       <p>Let <emph>AC</emph> be drawn at right angles to the straight line <emph>AB</emph> from the point <emph>A</emph> on it [<ref target="elem.1.11" targOrder="U">I. 11</ref>], and let <emph>AD</emph> be made equal to <emph>AB</emph>; through the point <emph>D</emph> let <emph>DE</emph> be drawn <emph>AB</emph>, and through the point <emph>B</emph> let <emph>BE</emph> be drawn parallel to <emph>AD</emph>. [<ref target="elem.1.31" targOrder="U">I. 31</ref>] </p>
       <p>Therefore <emph>ADEB</emph> is a parallelogram; <hi rend="center">therefore <emph>AB</emph> is equal to <emph>DE</emph>, and <emph>AD</emph> to <emph>BE</emph>. [<ref target="elem.1.34" targOrder="U">I. 34</ref>]</hi></p>
       <p>But <emph>AB</emph> is equal to <emph>AD</emph>; <hi rend="center">therefore the four straight lines <emph>BA</emph>, <emph>AD</emph>, <emph>DE</emph>, <emph>EB</emph> are equal to one another;</hi> therefore the parallelogram <emph>ADEB</emph> is equilateral.</p>
       <p>I say next that it is also right-angled.</p>
       <p>For, since the straight line <emph>AD</emph> falls upon the parallels <emph>AB</emph>, <emph>DE</emph>, <hi rend="center">the angles <emph>BAD</emph>, <emph>ADE</emph> are equal to two right angles. [<ref target="elem.1.29" targOrder="U">I. 29</ref>]</hi></p>
       <p>But the angle <emph>BAD</emph> is right; <hi rend="center">therefore the angle <emph>ADE</emph> is also right.</hi></p>
       <p>And in parallelogrammic areas the opposite sides and <ref target="elem.1.34" targOrder="U">I. 34</ref>] <hi rend="center">therefore each of the opposite angles <emph>ABE</emph>, <emph>BED</emph> is also right. Therefore <emph>ADEB</emph> is right-angled.</hi></p>
       <p>And it was also proved equilateral. </p>
       <p>Therefore it is a square; and it is described on the straight line <emph>AB</emph>.</p>

       <p>Proclus (<xref n="Proc. p. 423, 18" from="ROOT" to="DITTO" targOrder="U">p. 423, 18 sqq.</xref>) notes the difference between the word <emph>construct</emph> (<foreign lang="greek">συστἡσασθαι</foreign>) applied by Euclid to the construction of a <emph>triangle</emph> (and, he might have added, of an <emph>angle</emph>) and the words <emph>describe on</emph> (<foreign lang="greek">ἀναγράφειν ἀπό</foreign>) used of drawing a square on a given straight line as one side. The <emph>triangle</emph> (or <emph>angle</emph>) is, so to say, pieced together, while the describing of a square on a given straight line is the making of a figure <quote>from</quote>
 <emph>one</emph> side, and corresponds to the multiplication of the number representing the side by itself.</p>
