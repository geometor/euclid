      <head>Proposition 47.</head>
      <div4 type="Enunc">
       <p>In right-angled triangles the square on the side subtending the right angle is equal to the squares on the sides containing the right angle.</p>
      </div4>
      <div4 type="Proof">
       <p>Let <emph>ABC</emph> be a right-angled triangle having the angle <emph>BAC</emph> right;</p>
       <p>I say that the square on <emph>BC</emph> is equal to the squares on <emph>BA</emph>, <emph>AC</emph>.</p>
       <p>For let there be described on <emph>BC</emph> the square <emph>BDEC</emph>, <emph>BA</emph>, <emph>AC</emph> the squares <emph>GB</emph>, <emph>HC</emph>; [<ref target="elem.1.46" targOrder="U">I. 46</ref>] through <emph>A</emph> let <emph>AL</emph> be drawn parallel to either <emph>BD</emph> or <emph>CE</emph>, and let <emph>AD</emph>, <emph>FC</emph> be joined. </p>
       <p>Then, since each of the angles <emph>BAC</emph>, <emph>BAG</emph> is right, it follows that with a straight line <emph>BA</emph>, and at the point <emph>A</emph> on it, the two straight lines <emph>AC</emph>, <emph>AG</emph> not lying on the same side make the adjacent angles equal to two right angles; <hi rend="center">therefore <emph>CA</emph> is in a straight line with <emph>AG</emph>. [<ref target="elem.1.14" targOrder="U">I. 14</ref>]</hi>
        </p>
       <p>For the same reason <hi rend="center"><emph>BA</emph> is also in a straight line with <emph>AH</emph>.</hi></p>
       <p>And, since the angle <emph>DBC</emph> is equal to the angle <emph>FBA</emph>: for each is right: let the angle <emph>ABC</emph> be added to each; <hi rend="center">therefore the whole angle <emph>DBA</emph> is equal to the whole angle <emph>FBC</emph>. [<ref target="elem.1.c.n.2" targOrder="U">C.N. 2</ref>]</hi>
        </p>
       <p>And, since <emph>DB</emph> is equal to <emph>BC</emph>, and <emph>FB</emph> to <emph>BA</emph>, the two sides <emph>AB</emph>, <emph>BD</emph> are equal to the two sides <emph>FB</emph>, <emph>BC</emph> respectively, <hi rend="center">and the angle <emph>ABD</emph> is equal to the angle <emph>FBC</emph>; therefore the base <emph>AD</emph> is equal to the base <emph>FC</emph>, and the triangle <emph>ABD</emph> is equal to the triangle <emph>FBC</emph>. [<ref target="elem.1.4" targOrder="U">I. 4</ref>]</hi></p>
       <p>Now the parallelogram <emph>BL</emph> is double of the triangle <emph>ABD</emph>, for they have the same base <emph>BD</emph> and are in the same parallels <emph>BD</emph>, <emph>AL</emph>. [<ref target="elem.1.41" targOrder="U">I. 41</ref>]</p>
       <p>And the square <emph>GB</emph> is double of the triangle <emph>FBC</emph>, for they again have the same base <emph>FB</emph> and are in the same parallels <emph>FB</emph>, <emph>GC</emph>. [<ref target="elem.1.41" targOrder="U">I. 41</ref>]</p>
       <p>[But the doubles of equals are equal to one another.] <hi rend="center">Therefore the parallelogram <emph>BL</emph> is also equal to the square <emph>GB</emph>.</hi></p>
       <p>Similarly, if <emph>AE</emph>, <emph>BK</emph> be joined, the parallelogram <emph>CL</emph> can also be proved equal to the square <emph>HC</emph>; <hi rend="center">therefore the whole square <emph>BDEC</emph> is equal to the two squares <emph>GB</emph>, <emph>HC</emph>. [<ref target="elem.1.c.n.2" targOrder="U">C.N. 2</ref>]</hi></p>
       <p>And the square <emph>BDEC</emph> is described on <emph>BC</emph>, <hi rend="center">and the squares <emph>GB</emph>, <emph>HC</emph> on <emph>BA</emph>, <emph>AC</emph>.</hi></p>
       <p>Therefore the square on the side <emph>BC</emph> is equal to the <emph>BA</emph>, <emph>AC</emph>.</p>
       <p>Therefore etc.</p>
