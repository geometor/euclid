       <p>To bisect a given rectilineal angle.</p>
      </div4>
      <div4 type="Proof">
       <p>Let the angle <emph>BAC</emph> be the given rectilineal angle.</p>
       <p>Thus it is required to bisect it.</p>
       <p>Let a point <emph>D</emph> be taken at random on <emph>AB</emph>; let <emph>AE</emph> be cut off from <emph>AC</emph> equal to <emph>AD</emph>; [<ref target="elem.1.3" targOrder="U">I. 3</ref>] let <emph>DE</emph> be joined, and on <emph>DE</emph> let the equilateral triangle <emph>DEF</emph> be constructed; let <emph>AF</emph> be joined. </p>
       <p>I say that the angle <emph>BAC</emph> has been bisected by the straight line <emph>AF</emph>.</p>
       <p>For, since <emph>AD</emph> is equal to <emph>AE</emph>, and <emph>AF</emph> is common, <hi rend="center">the two sides <emph>DA</emph>, <emph>AF</emph> are equal to the two sides <emph>EA</emph>, <emph>AF</emph> respectively.</hi></p>
       <p>And the base <emph>DF</emph> is equal to the base <emph>EF</emph>; <hi rend="center">therefore the angle <emph>DAF</emph> is equal to the angle <emph>EAF</emph>. [<ref target="elem.1.8" targOrder="U">I. 8</ref>]</hi></p>
       <p>Therefore the given rectilineal angle <emph>BAC</emph> has been bisected by the straight line <emph>AF</emph>.</p>
