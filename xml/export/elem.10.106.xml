      <p><hi rend="ital">A straight line commensurable with that which produces with a rational area a medial whole is a straight line which produces with a rational area a medial whole</hi>. </p>
      <p>Let <hi rend="ital">AB</hi> be a straight line which produces with a rational area a medial whole, and <hi rend="ital">CD</hi> commensurable with <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>; I say that <hi rend="ital">CD</hi> is also a straight line which produces with a rational area a medial whole. </p>
      <p>For let <hi rend="ital">BE</hi> be the annex to <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>; therefore <hi rend="ital">AE</hi>, <hi rend="ital">EB</hi> are straight lines incommensurable in square which make the sum of the squares on <hi rend="ital">AE</hi>, <hi rend="ital">EB</hi> medial, but the rectangle contained by them rational. [<ref target="elem.10.77" targOrder="U">X. 77</ref>] </p>
      <p>Let the same construction be made. </p>
      <p>Then we can prove, in manner similar to the foregoing, that <hi rend="ital">CF</hi>, <hi rend="ital">FD</hi> are in the same ratio as <hi rend="ital">AE</hi>, <hi rend="ital">EB</hi>, the sum of the squares on <hi rend="ital">AE</hi>, <hi rend="ital">EB</hi> is commensurable with the sum of the squares on <hi rend="ital">CF</hi>, <hi rend="ital">FD</hi>, and the rectangle <hi rend="ital">AE</hi>, <hi rend="ital">EB</hi> with the rectangle <hi rend="ital">CF</hi>, <hi rend="ital">FD</hi>; so that <hi rend="ital">CF</hi>, <hi rend="ital">FD</hi> are also straight lines incommensurable in square which make the sum of the squares on <hi rend="ital">CF</hi>, <hi rend="ital">FD</hi> medial, but the rectangle contained by them rational. </p>
      <p>Therefore <hi rend="ital">CD</hi> is a straight line which produces with a rational area a medial whole. [<ref target="elem.10.77" targOrder="U">X. 77</ref>] Q. E. D.</p>
