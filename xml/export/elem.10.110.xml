      <p><hi rend="ital">If from a medial area there be subtracted a medial area incommensurable with the whole, the two remaining irrational straight lines arise, either a second apotome of a medial straight line or a straight line which produces with a medial area a medial whole</hi>. </p>
      <p>For, as in the foregoing figures, let there be subtracted from the medial area <hi rend="ital">BC</hi> the medial area <hi rend="ital">BD</hi> incommensurable with the whole; <quote>side</quote>
 of <hi rend="ital">EC</hi> is one of two irrational straight lines, either a second apotome of a medial straight line or a straight line which produces with a medial area a medial whole. </p>
      <p>For, since each of the rectangles <hi rend="ital">BC</hi>, <hi rend="ital">BD</hi> is medial, and <hi rend="ital">BC</hi> is incommensurable with <hi rend="ital">BD</hi>, it follows that each of the straight lines <hi rend="ital">FH</hi>, <hi rend="ital">FK</hi> will be rational and incommensurable in length with <hi rend="ital">FG</hi>. [<ref target="elem.10.22" targOrder="U">X. 22</ref>] </p>
      <p>And, since <hi rend="ital">BC</hi> is incommensurable with <hi rend="ital">BD</hi>, that is, <hi rend="ital">GH</hi> with <hi rend="ital">GK</hi>, <hi rend="ital">HF</hi> is also incommensurable with <hi rend="ital">FK</hi>; [<ref target="elem.6.1" targOrder="U">VI. 1</ref>, <ref target="elem.10.11" targOrder="U">X. 11</ref>] therefore <hi rend="ital">FH</hi>, <hi rend="ital">FK</hi> are rational straight lines commensurable in square only; therefore <hi rend="ital">KH</hi> is an apotome. [<ref target="elem.10.73" targOrder="U">X. 73</ref>] </p>
      <p>If then the square on <hi rend="ital">FH</hi> is greater than the square on <hi rend="ital">FK</hi> by the square on a straight line commensurable with <hi rend="ital">FH</hi>, while neither of the straight lines <hi rend="ital">FH</hi>, <hi rend="ital">FK</hi> is commensurable in length with the rational straight line <hi rend="ital">FG</hi> set out, <hi rend="ital">KH</hi> is a third apotome. [<ref target="elem.10.def.3.3" targOrder="U">X. Deff. III. 3</ref>] </p>
      <p>But <hi rend="ital">KL</hi> is rational, and the rectangle contained by a rational straight line and a third apotome is irrational, and the <quote>side</quote>
 of it is irrational, and is called a second apotome of a medial straight line; [<ref target="elem.10.93" targOrder="U">X. 93</ref>] so that the <quote>side</quote>
 of <hi rend="ital">LH</hi>, that is, of <hi rend="ital">EC</hi>, is a second apotome of a medial straight line. </p>
      <p>But, if the square on <hi rend="ital">FH</hi> is greater than the square on <hi rend="ital">FK</hi> by the square on a straight line incommensurable with <hi rend="ital">FH</hi>, while neither of the straight lines <hi rend="ital">HF</hi>, <hi rend="ital">FK</hi> is commensurable in length with <hi rend="ital">FG</hi>, <hi rend="ital">KH</hi> is a sixth apotome. [<ref target="elem.10.def.3.6" targOrder="U">X. Deff. III. 6</ref>] </p>
      <p>But the <quote>side</quote>
 of the rectangle contained by a rational straight line and a sixth apotome is a straight line which produces with a medial area a medial whole. [<ref target="elem.10.96" targOrder="U">X. 96</ref>] </p>
      <p>Therefore the <quote>side</quote>
 of <hi rend="ital">LH</hi>, that is, of <hi rend="ital">EC</hi>, is a straight line which produces with a medial area a medial whole. Q. E. D.</p>
