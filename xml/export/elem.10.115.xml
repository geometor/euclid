      <p><hi rend="ital">From a medial straight line there arise irrational straight lines infinite in number, and none of them is the same as any of the preceding</hi>. </p>
      <p>Let <hi rend="ital">A</hi> be a medial straight line; I say that from <hi rend="ital">A</hi> there arise irrational straight lines infinite in number, and none of them is the same as any of the preceding. </p>
      <p>Let a rational straight line <hi rend="ital">B</hi> be set out, <hi rend="ital">C</hi> be equal to the rectangle <hi rend="ital">B</hi>, <hi rend="ital">A</hi>; therefore <hi rend="ital">C</hi> is irrational; [<ref target="elem.10.def.4" targOrder="U">X. Def. 4</ref>] for that which is contained by an irrational and a rational straight line is irrational. [deduction from <ref target="elem.10.20" targOrder="U">X. 20</ref>] </p>
      <p>And it is not the same with any of the preceding; for the square on none of the preceding, if applied to a rational straight line produces as breadth a medial straight line. </p>
      <p>Again, let the square on <hi rend="ital">D</hi> be equal to the rectangle <hi rend="ital">B</hi>, <hi rend="ital">C</hi>; therefore the square on <hi rend="ital">D</hi> is irrational. [deduction from <ref target="elem.10.20" targOrder="U">X. 20</ref>] </p>
      <p>Therefore <hi rend="ital">D</hi> is irrational; [<ref target="elem.10.def.4" targOrder="U">X. Def. 4</ref>] and it is not the same with any of the preceding, for the square on none of the preceding, if applied to a rational straight line, produces <hi rend="ital">C</hi> as breadth. </p>
      <p>Similarly, if this arrangement proceeds <foreign lang="la">ad infinitum</foreign>, it is manifest that from the medial straight line there arise irrational straight lines infinite in number, and none is the same with any of the preceding. Q. E. D.</p>
