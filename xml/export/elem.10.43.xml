      <p><hi rend="ital">A first bimedial straight line is divided at one point only</hi>. </p>
      <p>Let <hi rend="ital">AB</hi> be a first bimedial straight line divided at <hi rend="ital">C</hi>, so that <hi rend="ital">AC</hi>, <hi rend="ital">CB</hi> are medial straight lines commensurable in square only and containing a rational rectangle; <hi rend="ital">AB</hi> is not so divided at another point. </p>
      <p>For, if possible, let it be divided at <hi rend="ital">D</hi> also, so that <hi rend="ital">AD</hi>, <hi rend="ital">DB</hi> are also medial straight lines commensurable in square only and containing a rational rectangle. </p>
      <p>Since, then, that by which twice the rectangle <hi rend="ital">AD</hi>, <hi rend="ital">DB</hi> differs from twice the rectangle <hi rend="ital">AC</hi>, <hi rend="ital">CB</hi> is that by which the squares on <hi rend="ital">AC</hi>, <hi rend="ital">CB</hi> differ from the squares on <hi rend="ital">AD</hi>, <hi rend="ital">DB</hi>, while twice the rectangle <hi rend="ital">AD</hi>, <hi rend="ital">DB</hi> differs from twice the rectangle <hi rend="ital">AC</hi>, <hi rend="ital">CB</hi> by a rational area—for both are rational— therefore the squares on <hi rend="ital">AC</hi>, <hi rend="ital">CB</hi> also differ from the squares on <hi rend="ital">AD</hi>, <hi rend="ital">DB</hi> by a rational area, though they are medial: which is absurd. [<ref target="elem.10.26" targOrder="U">x. 26</ref>

      <p>Therefore a first bimedial straight line is not divided into its terms at different points; therefore it is so divided at one point only.</p>
