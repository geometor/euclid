      <p><hi rend="ital">If two magnitudes have to one another the ratio which a number has to a number</hi>, <hi rend="ital">the magnitudes will be commensurable</hi>. </p>
      <p>For let the two magnitudes <hi rend="ital">A</hi>, <hi rend="ital">B</hi> have to one another the ratio which the number <hi rend="ital">D</hi> has to the number <hi rend="ital">E</hi>; <hi rend="ital">A</hi>, <hi rend="ital">B</hi> are commensurable. </p>
      <p>For let <hi rend="ital">A</hi> be divided into as many equal parts as there are units in <hi rend="ital">D</hi>, and let <hi rend="ital">C</hi> be equal to one of them; and let <hi rend="ital">F</hi> be made up of as many magnitudes equal to <hi rend="ital">C</hi> as <hi rend="ital">E</hi>. </p>
      <p>Since then there are in <hi rend="ital">A</hi> as many magnitudes equal to <hi rend="ital">C</hi> as there are units in <hi rend="ital">D</hi>, whatever part the unit is of <hi rend="ital">D</hi>, the same part is <hi rend="ital">C</hi> of <hi rend="ital">A</hi> also; therefore, as <hi rend="ital">C</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">A</hi>, so is the unit to <hi rend="ital">D</hi>. [<ref target="elem.7.def.20" targOrder="U">VII. Def. 20</ref>] </p>
      <p>But the unit measures the number <hi rend="ital">D</hi>; therefore <hi rend="ital">C</hi> also measures <hi rend="ital">A</hi>. </p>
      <p>And since, as <hi rend="ital">C</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">A</hi>, so is the unit to <hi rend="ital">D</hi>, therefore, inversely, as <hi rend="ital">A</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">C</hi>, so is the number <hi rend="ital">D</hi> to the unit. [cf. <ref target="elem.5.7.p.1" targOrder="U">V. 7, Por.</ref>] </p>
      <p>Again, since there are in <hi rend="ital">F</hi> as many magnitudes equal to <hi rend="ital">C</hi> as there are units in <hi rend="ital">E</hi>, therefore, as <hi rend="ital">C</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">F</hi>, so is the unit to <hi rend="ital">E</hi>. [<ref target="elem.7.def.20" targOrder="U">VII. Def. 20</ref>] </p>
      <p>But it was also proved that, <hi rend="center">as <hi rend="ital">A</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">C</hi>, so is <hi rend="ital">D</hi> to the unit;</hi>
       <foreign lang="la">ex aequali</foreign>, as <hi rend="ital">A</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">F</hi>, so is <hi rend="ital">D</hi> to <hi rend="ital">E</hi>. [<ref target="elem.5.22" targOrder="U">v. 22</ref>] </p>
      <p>But, as <hi rend="ital">D</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">E</hi>, so is <hi rend="ital">A</hi> to <hi rend="ital">B</hi>; therefore also, as <hi rend="ital">A</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">B</hi>, so is it to <hi rend="ital">F</hi> also. [<ref target="elem.5.11" targOrder="U">V. 11</ref>] </p>
      <p>Therefore <hi rend="ital">A</hi> has the same ratio to each of the magnitudes <hi rend="ital">B</hi>, <hi rend="ital">F</hi>; <hi rend="ital">B</hi> is equal to <hi rend="ital">F</hi>. A[<ref target="elem.5.9" targOrder="U">V. 9</ref>] </p>
      <p>But <hi rend="ital">C</hi> measures <hi rend="ital">F</hi>; therefore it measures <hi rend="ital">B</hi> also. </p>
      <p>Further it measures <hi rend="ital">A</hi> also; therefore <hi rend="ital">C</hi> measures <hi rend="ital">A</hi>, <hi rend="ital">B</hi>. </p>
      <p>Therefore <hi rend="ital">A</hi> is commensurable with <hi rend="ital">B</hi>. </p>
      <p>Therefore etc. </p>
      <div4 id="elem.10.6.p.1" type="porism">
       <head>PORISM.</head>
       <p>From this it is manifest that, if there be two numbers, as <hi rend="ital">D</hi>, <hi rend="ital">E</hi>, and a straight line, as <hi rend="ital">A</hi>, it is possible to make a straight line [<hi rend="ital">F</hi>] such that the given straight line is to <hi rend="ital">D</hi> is to the number <hi rend="ital">E</hi>. </p>
       <p>And, if a mean proportional be also taken between <hi rend="ital">A</hi>, <hi rend="ital">F</hi>, as <hi rend="ital">B</hi>, </p>
       <p>as <hi rend="ital">A</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">F</hi>, so will the square on <hi rend="ital">A</hi> be to the square on <hi rend="ital">B</hi>, that is, as the first is to the third, so is the figure on the first <ref target="elem.6.19.p.1" targOrder="U">VI. 19, Por.</ref>] </p>
       <p>But, as <hi rend="ital">A</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">F</hi>, so is the number <hi rend="ital">D</hi> to the number <hi rend="ital">E</hi>; therefore it has been contrived that, as the number <hi rend="ital">D</hi> is to the number <hi rend="ital">E</hi>, so also is the figure on the straight line <hi rend="ital">A</hi> to the figure on the straight line <hi rend="ital">B</hi>.
