      <p><hi rend="ital">The square on the major straight line applied to a rational straight line produces as breadth the fourth binomial</hi>. </p>
      <p>Let <hi rend="ital">AB</hi> be a major straight line divided at <hi rend="ital">C</hi>, so that <hi rend="ital">AC</hi> is greater than <hi rend="ital">CB</hi>; let <hi rend="ital">DE</hi> be a rational straight line, <hi rend="ital">DE</hi> let there be applied the parallelogram <hi rend="ital">DF</hi> equal to the square on <hi rend="ital">AB</hi> and producing <hi rend="ital">DG</hi> as its breadth; I say that <hi rend="ital">DG</hi> is a fourth binomial straight line. </p>
      <p>Let the same construction be made as before shown. </p>
      <p>Then, since <hi rend="ital">AB</hi> is a major straight line divided at <hi rend="ital">C</hi>, <hi rend="ital">AC</hi>, <hi rend="ital">CB</hi> are straight lines incommensurable in square which make the sum of the squares on them rational, but the rectangle contained by them medial. [<ref target="elem.10.39" targOrder="U">X. 39</ref>] </p>
      <p>Since then the sum of the squares on <hi rend="ital">AC</hi>, <hi rend="ital">CB</hi> is rational, therefore <hi rend="ital">DL</hi> is rational; therefore <hi rend="ital">DM</hi> is also rational and commensurable in length with <hi rend="ital">DE</hi>. [<ref target="elem.10.20" targOrder="U">X. 20</ref>] </p>
      <p>Again, since twice the rectangle <hi rend="ital">AC</hi>, <hi rend="ital">CB</hi>, that is, <hi rend="ital">MF</hi>, is medial, and it is applied to the rational straight line <hi rend="ital">ML</hi>, therefore <hi rend="ital">MG</hi> is also rational and incommensurable in length with <hi rend="ital">DE</hi>; [<ref target="elem.10.22" targOrder="U">X. 22</ref>] therefore <hi rend="ital">DM</hi> is also incommensurable in length with <hi rend="ital">MG</hi>. [<ref target="elem.10.13" targOrder="U">X. 13</ref>] </p>
      <p>Therefore <hi rend="ital">DM</hi>, <hi rend="ital">MG</hi> are rational straight lines commensurable in square only; therefore <hi rend="ital">DG</hi> is binomial. [<ref target="elem.10.36" targOrder="U">X. 36</ref>] </p>
      <p>It is to be proved that it is also a fourth binomial straight line. </p>
      <p>In manner similar to the foregoing we can prove that <hi rend="ital">DM</hi> is greater than <hi rend="ital">MG</hi>, and that the rectangle <hi rend="ital">DK</hi>, <hi rend="ital">KM</hi> is equal to the square on <hi rend="ital">MN</hi>. </p>
      <p>Since then the square on <hi rend="ital">AC</hi> is incommensurable with the square on <hi rend="ital">CB</hi>, therefore <hi rend="ital">DH</hi> is also incommensurable with <hi rend="ital">KL</hi>, so that <hi rend="ital">DK</hi> is also incommensurable with <hi rend="ital">KM</hi>. [<ref target="elem.6.1" targOrder="U">VI. 1</ref>, <ref target="elem.10.11" targOrder="U">X. 11</ref>] </p>
      <p>But, if there be two unequal straight lines, and to the greater there be applied a parallelogram equal to the fourth part of the square on the less and deficient by a square figure, and if it divide it into incommensurable parts, then the <ref target="elem.10.18" targOrder="U">X. 18</ref>] therefore the square on <hi rend="ital">DM</hi> is greater than the square on <hi rend="ital">MG</hi> by the square on a straight line incommensurable with <hi rend="ital">DM</hi>. </p>
      <p>And <hi rend="ital">DM</hi>, <hi rend="ital">MG</hi> are rational straight lines commensurable in square only, and <hi rend="ital">DM</hi> is commensurable with the rational straight line <hi rend="ital">DE</hi> set out. </p>
      <p>Therefore <hi rend="ital">DG</hi> is a fourth binomial straight line. [<ref target="elem.10.def.2.4" targOrder="U">X. Deff. II. 4</ref>] Q. E. D.</p>
