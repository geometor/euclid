      <p><hi rend="ital">A straight line commensurable in length with a binomial straight line is itself also binomial and the same in order</hi>. </p>
      <p>Let <hi rend="ital">AB</hi> be binomial, and let <hi rend="ital">CD</hi> be commensurable in length with <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>; <hi rend="ital">CD</hi> is binomial and the same in order with <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>. </p>
      <p>For, since <hi rend="ital">AB</hi> is binomial, let it be divided into its terms at <hi rend="ital">E</hi>, and let <hi rend="ital">AE</hi> be the greater term; <hi rend="ital">AE</hi>, <hi rend="ital">EB</hi> are rational straight lines commensurable in square only. [<ref target="elem.10.36" targOrder="U">X. 36</ref>] </p>
      <p>Let it be contrived that, as <hi rend="ital">AB</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">CD</hi>, so is <hi rend="ital">AE</hi> to <hi rend="ital">CF</hi>; [<ref target="elem.6.12" targOrder="U">VI. 12</ref>] therefore also the remainder <hi rend="ital">EB</hi> is to the remainder <hi rend="ital">FD</hi> as <hi rend="ital">AB</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">CD</hi>. [<ref target="elem.5.19" targOrder="U">V. 19</ref>] </p>
      <p>But <hi rend="ital">AB</hi> is commensurable in length with <hi rend="ital">CD</hi>; therefore <hi rend="ital">AE</hi> is also commensurable with <hi rend="ital">CF</hi>, and <hi rend="ital">EB</hi> with <hi rend="ital">FD</hi>. [<ref target="elem.10.11" targOrder="U">X. 11</ref>] </p>
      <p>And <hi rend="ital">AE</hi>, <hi rend="ital">EB</hi> are rational; therefore <hi rend="ital">CF</hi>, <hi rend="ital">FD</hi> are also rational. </p>
      <p>And, as <hi rend="ital">AE</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">CF</hi>, so is <hi rend="ital">EB</hi> to <hi rend="ital">FD</hi>. [<ref target="elem.5.11" targOrder="U">V. 11</ref>] </p>
      <p>Therefore, alternately, as <hi rend="ital">AE</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">EB</hi>, so is <hi rend="ital">CF</hi> to <hi rend="ital">FD</hi>. [<ref target="elem.5.16" targOrder="U">V. 16</ref>] </p>
      <p>But <hi rend="ital">AE</hi>, <hi rend="ital">EB</hi> are commensurable in square only; therefore <hi rend="ital">CF</hi>, <hi rend="ital">FD</hi> are also commensurable in square only. [<ref target="elem.10.11" targOrder="U">X. 11</ref>] </p>
      <p>And they are rational; therefore <hi rend="ital">CD</hi> is binomial. [<ref target="elem.10.36" targOrder="U">X. 36</ref>] </p>
      <p>I say next that it is the same in order with <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>. </p>
      <p>For the square on <hi rend="ital">AE</hi> is greater than the square on <hi rend="ital">EB</hi> either by the square on a straight line commensurable with <hi rend="ital">AE</hi> or by the square on a straight line incommensurable with it. </p>
      <p>If then the square on <hi rend="ital">AE</hi> is greater than the square on <hi rend="ital">EB</hi> by the square on a straight line commensurable with <hi rend="ital">AE</hi>, the square on <hi rend="ital">CF</hi> will also be greater than the square on <hi rend="ital">FD</hi> by the square on a straight line commensurable with <hi rend="ital">CF</hi>. [<ref target="elem.10.14" targOrder="U">X. 14</ref>] </p>
      <p>And, if <hi rend="ital">AE</hi> is commensurable with the rational straight line set out, <hi rend="ital">CF</hi> will also be commensurable with it, [<ref target="elem.10.12" targOrder="U">X. 12</ref>] and for this reason each of the straight lines <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">CD</hi> is a first binomial, that is, the same in order. [<ref target="elem.10.def.2.1" targOrder="U">X. Deff. II. 1</ref>] </p>
      <p>But, if <hi rend="ital">EB</hi> is commensurable with the rational straight line set out, <hi rend="ital">FD</hi> is also commensurable with it, [<ref target="elem.10.12" targOrder="U">X. 12</ref>] and for this reason again <hi rend="ital">CD</hi> will be the same in order with <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>, for each of them will be a second binomial. [<ref target="elem.10.def.2.2" targOrder="U">X. Deff. II. 2</ref>] </p>
      <p>But, if neither of the straight lines <hi rend="ital">AE</hi>, <hi rend="ital">EB</hi> is commensurable with the rational straight line set out, neither of the straight lines <hi rend="ital">CF</hi>, <hi rend="ital">FD</hi> will be commensurable with it, [<ref target="elem.10.13" targOrder="U">X. 13</ref>] and each of the straight lines <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">CD</hi> is a third binomial. [<ref target="elem.10.def.2.3" targOrder="U">X. Deff. II. 3</ref>] </p>
      <p>But, if the square on <hi rend="ital">AE</hi> is greater than the square on <hi rend="ital">EB</hi> by the square on a straight line incommensurable with <hi rend="ital">AE</hi>, the square on <hi rend="ital">CF</hi> is also greater than the square on <hi rend="ital">FD</hi> by the square on a straight line incommensurable with <hi rend="ital">CF</hi>. [<ref target="elem.10.14" targOrder="U">X. 14</ref>] </p>
      <p>And, if <hi rend="ital">AE</hi> is commensurable with the rational straight line set out, <hi rend="ital">CF</hi> is also commensurable with it, and each of the straight lines <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">CD</hi> is a fourth binomial. [<ref target="elem.10.def.2.4" targOrder="U">X. Deff. II. 4</ref>] </p>
      <p>But, if <hi rend="ital">EB</hi> is so commensurable, so is <hi rend="ital">FD</hi> also, and each of the straight lines <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">CD</hi> will be a fifth binomial. [<ref target="elem.10.def.2.5" targOrder="U">X. Deff. II. 5</ref>] </p>
      <p>But, if neither of the straight lines <hi rend="ital">AE</hi>, <hi rend="ital">EB</hi> is so commensurable, neither of the straight lines <hi rend="ital">CF</hi>, <hi rend="ital">FD</hi> is commensurable with the rational straight line set out, and each of the straight lines <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">CD</hi> will be a sixth binomial. [<ref target="elem.10.def.2.6" targOrder="U">X. Deff. II. 6</ref>] </p>
      <p>Hence a straight line commensurable in length with a binomial straight line is binomial and the same in order. Q. E. D.</p>
