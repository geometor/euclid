      <p><hi rend="ital">If two magnitudes have not to one another the ratio which a number has to a number</hi>, <hi rend="ital">the magnitudes will be incommensurable</hi>. </p>
      <p>For let the two magnitudes <hi rend="ital">A</hi>, <hi rend="ital">B</hi> not have to one another the ratio which a number has to a number; I say that the magnitudes <hi rend="ital">A</hi>, <hi rend="ital">B</hi> are incommensurable. </p>
      <p>For, if they are commensurable, <hi rend="ital">A</hi> will have to <hi rend="ital">B</hi> the ratio which a number has to a number. [<ref target="elem.10.5" targOrder="U">X. 5</ref>] </p>
      <p>But it has not; therefore the magnitudes <hi rend="ital">A</hi>, <hi rend="ital">B</hi> are incommensurable. </p>
      <p>Therefore etc.</p>
