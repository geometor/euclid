       <hi rend="ital">To set up a straight line at right angles to a given plane from a given point in it.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>Let the plane of reference be the given plane, and <hi rend="ital">A</hi> the point in it; thus it is required to set up from the point <hi rend="ital">A</hi> a straight line at right angles to the plane of reference. </p>
      <p>Let any elevated point <hi rend="ital">B</hi> be conceived, from <hi rend="ital">B</hi> let <hi rend="ital">BC</hi> be drawn perpendicular to the plane of reference, [<ref target="elem.11.11" targOrder="U">XI. 11</ref>] and through the point <hi rend="ital">A</hi> let <hi rend="ital">AD</hi> be drawn parallel to <hi rend="ital">BC</hi>. [<ref target="elem.1.31" targOrder="U">I. 31</ref>] </p>
      <p>Then, since <hi rend="ital">AD</hi>, <hi rend="ital">CB</hi> are two parallel straight lines, while one of them, <hi rend="ital">BC</hi>, is at right angles to the plane of reference, therefore the remaining one, <hi rend="ital">AD</hi>, is also at right angles to the plane of reference. [<ref target="elem.11.8" targOrder="U">XI. 8</ref>] </p>
      <p>Therefore <hi rend="ital">AD</hi> has been set up at right angles to the given plane from the point <hi rend="ital">A</hi> in it.</p>
