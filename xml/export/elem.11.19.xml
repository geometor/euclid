      <p><hi rend="ital">If two planes which cut one another be at right angles to any plane</hi>, <hi rend="ital">their common section will also be at right angles to the same plane.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>For let the two planes <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">BC</hi> be at right angles to the plane of reference, and let <hi rend="ital">BD</hi> be their common section; I say that <hi rend="ital">BD</hi> is at right angles to the plane of reference. </p>
      <p>For suppose it is not, and from the point <hi rend="ital">D</hi> let <hi rend="ital">DE</hi> be drawn in the plane <hi rend="ital">AB</hi> at right angles to the straight line <hi rend="ital">AD</hi>, and <hi rend="ital">DF</hi> in the plane <hi rend="ital">BC</hi> at right angles to <hi rend="ital">CD</hi>. </p>
      <p>Now, since the plane <hi rend="ital">AB</hi> is at right angles to the plane of reference, and <hi rend="ital">DE</hi> has been drawn in the plane <hi rend="ital">AB</hi> at right angles to <hi rend="ital">AD</hi>, their common section, therefore <hi rend="ital">DE</hi> is at right angles to the plane of reference. [<ref target="elem.11.def.4" targOrder="U">XI. Def. 4</ref>] </p>
      <p>Similarly we can prove that <hi rend="ital">DF</hi> is also at right angles to the plane of reference. </p>
      <p>Therefore from the same point <hi rend="ital">D</hi> two straight lines have been set up at right angles to the plane of reference on the same side: which is impossible. [<ref target="elem.11.13" targOrder="U">XI. 13</ref>] </p>
      <p>Therefore no straight line except the common section <hi rend="ital">DB</hi> of the planes <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">BC</hi> can be set up from the point <hi rend="ital">D</hi> at right angles to the plane of reference. </p>
      <p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
