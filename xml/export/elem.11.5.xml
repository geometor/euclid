      <p><hi rend="ital">If a straight line be set up at right angles to three straight lines which meet one another</hi>, <hi rend="ital">at their common point of section</hi>, <hi rend="ital">the three straight lines are in one plane.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>For let a straight line <hi rend="ital">AB</hi> be set up at right angles to the three straight lines <hi rend="ital">BC</hi>, <hi rend="ital">BD</hi>, <hi rend="ital">BE</hi>, at their point of meeting at <hi rend="ital">B</hi>; I say that <hi rend="ital">BC</hi>, <hi rend="ital">BD</hi>, <hi rend="ital">BE</hi> are in one plane. </p>
      <p>For suppose they are not, but, if possible, let <hi rend="ital">BD</hi>, <hi rend="ital">BE</hi> be in the plane of reference and <hi rend="ital">BC</hi> in one more elevated; let the plane through <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">BC</hi> be produced; it will thus make, as common section in the plane of reference, a straight line. [<ref target="elem.11.3" targOrder="U">XI. 3</ref>] </p>
      <p>Let it make <hi rend="ital">BF</hi>. </p>
      <p>Therefore the three straight lines <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">BC</hi>, <hi rend="ital">BF</hi> are in one plane, namely that drawn through <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">BC</hi>. </p>
      <p>Now, since <hi rend="ital">AB</hi> is at right angles to each of the straight lines <hi rend="ital">BD</hi>, <hi rend="ital">BE</hi>, therefore <hi rend="ital">AB</hi> is also at right angles to the plane through <hi rend="ital">BD</hi>, <hi rend="ital">BE</hi>. [<ref target="elem.11.4" targOrder="U">XI. 4</ref>] </p>
      <p>But the plane through <hi rend="ital">BD</hi>, <hi rend="ital">BE</hi> is the plane of reference; therefore <hi rend="ital">AB</hi> is at right angles to the plane of reference. </p>
      <p>Thus <hi rend="ital">AB</hi> will also make right angles with all the straight lines which meet it and are in the plane of reference. [<ref target="elem.11.def.3" targOrder="U">XI. Def. 3</ref>] </p>
      <p>But <hi rend="ital">BF</hi> which is in the plane of reference meets it; therefore the angle <hi rend="ital">ABF</hi> is right. </p>
      <p>But, by hypothesis, the angle <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi> is also right; therefore the angle <hi rend="ital">ABF</hi> is equal to the angle <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi>. </p>
      <p>And they are in one plane: which is impossible. </p>
      <p>Therefore the straight line <hi rend="ital">BC</hi> is not in a more elevated plane; therefore the three straight lines <hi rend="ital">BC</hi>, <hi rend="ital">BD</hi>, <hi rend="ital">BE</hi> are in one plane. </p>
      <p>Therefore, if a straight line be set up at right angles to three straight lines, at their point of meeting, the three straight lines are in one plane. Q. E. D.</p>
