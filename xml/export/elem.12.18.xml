       <hi rend="ital">Spheres are to one another in the triplicate ratio of their respective diameters.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>Let the spheres <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi>, <hi rend="ital">DEF</hi> be conceived, and let <hi rend="ital">BC</hi>, <hi rend="ital">EF</hi> be their diameters; I say that the sphere <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi> has to the sphere <hi rend="ital">DEF</hi> the ratio triplicate of that which <hi rend="ital">BC</hi> has to <hi rend="ital">EF</hi>. </p>
      <p>For, if the sphere <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi> has not to the sphere <hi rend="ital">DEF</hi> the ratio triplicate of that which <hi rend="ital">BC</hi> has to <hi rend="ital">EF</hi>, then the sphere <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi> will have either to some less sphere than the sphere <hi rend="ital">DEF</hi>, or to a greater, the ratio triplicate of that which <hi rend="ital">BC</hi> has to <hi rend="ital">EF</hi>. </p>
      <p>First, let it have that ratio to a less sphere <hi rend="ital">GHK</hi>, let <hi rend="ital">DEF</hi> be conceived about the same centre with <hi rend="ital">GHK</hi>, let there be inscribed in the greater sphere <hi rend="ital">DEF</hi> a polyhedral solid which does not touch the lesser sphere <hi rend="ital">GHK</hi> at its surface, [<ref target="elem.12.17" targOrder="U">XII. 17</ref>] <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi> a polyhedral solid similar to the polyhedral solid in the sphere <hi rend="ital">DEF</hi>; therefore the polyhedral solid in <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi> has to the polyhedral solid in <hi rend="ital">DEF</hi> the ratio triplicate of that which <hi rend="ital">BC</hi> has to <hi rend="ital">EF</hi>. [<ref target="elem.12.17.p.1" targOrder="U">XII. 17, Por.</ref>] </p>
      <p>But the sphere <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi> also has to the sphere <hi rend="ital">GHK</hi> the ratio triplicate of that which <hi rend="ital">BC</hi> has to <hi rend="ital">EF</hi>; therefore, as the sphere <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi> is to the sphere <hi rend="ital">GHK</hi>, so is the polyhedral solid in the sphere <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi> to the polyhedral solid in the sphere <hi rend="ital">DEF</hi>; and, alternately, as the sphere <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi> is to the polyhedron in it, so is the sphere <hi rend="ital">GHK</hi> to the polyhedral solid in the sphere <hi rend="ital">DEF</hi>. [<ref target="elem.5.16" targOrder="U">V. 16</ref>] </p>
      <p>But the sphere <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi> is greater than the polyhedron in it; therefore the sphere <hi rend="ital">GHK</hi> is also greater than the polyhedron in the sphere <hi rend="ital">DEF</hi>. </p>
      <p>But it is also less, for it is enclosed by it. </p>
      <p>Therefore the sphere <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi> has not to a less sphere than the sphere <hi rend="ital">DEF</hi> the ratio triplicate of that which the diameter <hi rend="ital">BC</hi> has to <hi rend="ital">EF</hi>. </p>
      <p>Similarly we can prove that neither has the sphere <hi rend="ital">DEF</hi> to a less sphere than the sphere <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi> the ratio triplicate of that which <hi rend="ital">EF</hi> has to <hi rend="ital">BC</hi>. </p>
      <p>I say next that neither has the sphere <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi> to any greater sphere than the sphere <hi rend="ital">DEF</hi> the ratio triplicate of that which <hi rend="ital">BC</hi> has to <hi rend="ital">EF</hi>. </p>
      <p>For, if possible, let it have that ratio to a greater, <hi rend="ital">LMN</hi>; therefore, inversely, the sphere <hi rend="ital">LMN</hi> has to the sphere <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi> the ratio triplicate of that which the diameter <hi rend="ital">EF</hi> has to the diameter <hi rend="ital">BC</hi>. </p>
      <p>But, inasmuch as <hi rend="ital">LMN</hi> is greater than <hi rend="ital">DEF</hi>, therefore, as the sphere <hi rend="ital">LMN</hi> is to the sphere <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi>, so is the sphere <hi rend="ital">DEF</hi> to some less sphere than the sphere <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi>, as was before proved. [<ref target="elem.12.2.l.1" targOrder="U">XII. 2, Lemma</ref>] </p>
      <p>Therefore the sphere <hi rend="ital">DEF</hi> also has to some less sphere than the sphere <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi> the ratio triplicate of that which <hi rend="ital">EF</hi> has to <hi rend="ital">BC</hi>: which was proved impossible. </p>
      <p>Therefore the sphere <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi> has not to any sphere greater than the sphere <hi rend="ital">DEF</hi> the ratio triplicate of that which <hi rend="ital">BC</hi> has to <hi rend="ital">EF</hi>. </p>
      <p>But it was proved that neither has it that ratio to a less sphere. </p>
      <p>Therefore the sphere <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi> has to the sphere <hi rend="ital">DEF</hi> the ratio triplicate of that which <hi rend="ital">BC</hi> has to <hi rend="ital">EF</hi>. Q. E. D.</p>
