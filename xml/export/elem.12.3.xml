      <p><hi rend="ital">Any pyramid which has a triangular base is divided into two pyramids equal and similar to one another</hi>, <hi rend="ital">similar to the whole and having triangular bases</hi>, <hi rend="ital">and into two equal prisms; and the two prisms are greater than the half of the whole pyramid.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>Let there be a pyramid of which the triangle <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi> is the base and the point <hi rend="ital">D</hi> the vertex; I say that the pyramid <hi rend="ital">ABCD</hi> is divided into two pyramids equal to one another, having triangular bases and similar to the whole pyramid, and into two equal prisms; and the two prisms are greater than the half of the whole pyramid. </p>
      <p>For let <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">BC</hi>, <hi rend="ital">CA</hi>, <hi rend="ital">AD</hi>, <hi rend="ital">DB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">DC</hi> be bisected at the points <hi rend="ital">E</hi>, <hi rend="ital">F</hi>, <hi rend="ital">G</hi>, <hi rend="ital">H</hi>, <hi rend="ital">K</hi>, <hi rend="ital">L</hi>, and let <hi rend="ital">HE</hi>, <hi rend="ital">EG</hi>, <hi rend="ital">GH</hi>, <hi rend="ital">HK</hi>, <hi rend="ital">KL</hi>, <hi rend="ital">LH</hi>, <hi rend="ital">KF</hi>, <hi rend="ital">FG</hi> be joined. </p>
      <p>Since <hi rend="ital">AE</hi> is equal to <hi rend="ital">EB</hi>, and <hi rend="ital">AH</hi> to <hi rend="ital">DH</hi>, therefore <hi rend="ital">EH</hi> is parallel to <hi rend="ital">DB</hi>. [<ref target="elem.6.2" targOrder="U">VI. 2</ref>] </p>
      <p>For the same reason <hi rend="ital">HK</hi> is also parallel to <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>. </p>
      <p>Therefore <hi rend="ital">HEBK</hi> is a parallelogram; therefore <hi rend="ital">HK</hi> is equal to <hi rend="ital">EB</hi>. [<ref target="elem.1.34" targOrder="U">I. 34</ref>] </p>
      <p>But <hi rend="ital">EB</hi> is equal to <hi rend="ital">EA</hi>; therefore <hi rend="ital">AE</hi> is also equal to <hi rend="ital">HK</hi>. </p>
      <p>But <hi rend="ital">AH</hi> is also equal to <hi rend="ital">HD</hi>; therefore the two sides <hi rend="ital">EA</hi>, <hi rend="ital">AH</hi> are equal to the two sides <hi rend="ital">KH</hi>, <hi rend="ital">HD</hi> respectively, and the angle <hi rend="ital">EAH</hi> is equal to the angle <hi rend="ital">KHD</hi>; therefore the base <hi rend="ital">EH</hi> is equal to the base <hi rend="ital">KD</hi>. [<ref target="elem.1.4" targOrder="U">I. 4</ref>] </p>
      <p>Therefore the triangle <hi rend="ital">AEH</hi> is equal and similar to the triangle <hi rend="ital">HKD</hi>. </p>
      <p>For the same reason the triangle <hi rend="ital">AHG</hi> is also equal and similar to the triangle <hi rend="ital">HLD</hi>. </p>
      <p>Now, since two straight lines <hi rend="ital">EH</hi>, <hi rend="ital">HG</hi> meeting one another are parallel to two straight lines <hi rend="ital">KD</hi>, <hi rend="ital">DL</hi> meeting one another, and are not in the same plane, they will contain equal angles. [<ref target="elem.11.10" targOrder="U">XI. 10</ref>] </p>
      <p>Therefore the angle <hi rend="ital">EHG</hi> is equal to the angle <hi rend="ital">KDL</hi>. </p>
      <p>And, since the two straight lines <hi rend="ital">EH</hi>, <hi rend="ital">HG</hi> are equal to the two <hi rend="ital">KD</hi>, <hi rend="ital">DL</hi> respectively, and the angle <hi rend="ital">EHG</hi> is equal to the angle <hi rend="ital">KDL</hi>, therefore the base <hi rend="ital">EG</hi> is equal to the base <hi rend="ital">KL</hi>; [<ref target="elem.1.4" targOrder="U">I. 4</ref>] therefore the triangle <hi rend="ital">EHG</hi> is equal and similar to the triangle <hi rend="ital">KDL</hi>. </p>
      <p>For the same reason the triangle <hi rend="ital">AEG</hi> is also equal and similar to the triangle <hi rend="ital">HKL</hi>. </p>
      <p>Therefore the pyramid of which the triangle <hi rend="ital">AEG</hi> is the base and the point <hi rend="ital">H</hi> the vertex is equal and similar to the pyramid of which the triangle <hi rend="ital">HKL</hi> is the base and the point <hi rend="ital">D</hi> the vertex. [<ref target="elem.11.def.10" targOrder="U">XI. Def. 10</ref>] </p>
      <p>And, since <hi rend="ital">HK</hi> has been drawn parallel to <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>, one of the sides of the triangle <hi rend="ital">ADB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">ADB</hi> is equiangular to the triangle <hi rend="ital">DHK</hi>, [<ref target="elem.1.29" targOrder="U">I. 29</ref>] and they have their sides proportional; therefore the triangle <hi rend="ital">ADB</hi> is similar to the triangle <hi rend="ital">DHK</hi>. [<ref target="elem.6.def.1" targOrder="U">VI. Def. 1</ref>] </p>
      <p>For the same reason the triangle <hi rend="ital">DBC</hi> is also similar to the triangle <hi rend="ital">DKL</hi>, and the triangle <hi rend="ital">ADC</hi> to the triangle <hi rend="ital">DLH</hi>. </p>
      <p>Now, since the two straight lines <hi rend="ital">BA</hi>, <hi rend="ital">AC</hi> meeting one another are parallel to the two straight lines <hi rend="ital">KH</hi>, <hi rend="ital">HL</hi> meeting one another, not in the same plane, they will contain equal angles. [<ref target="elem.11.10" targOrder="U">XI. 10</ref>] </p>
      <p>Therefore the angle <hi rend="ital">BAC</hi> is equal to the angle <hi rend="ital">KHL</hi>. </p>
      <p>And, as <hi rend="ital">BA</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">AC</hi>, so is <hi rend="ital">KH</hi> to <hi rend="ital">HL</hi>; therefore the triangle <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi> is similar to the triangle <hi rend="ital">HKL</hi>. </p>
      <p>Therefore also the pyramid of which the triangle <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi> is the base and the point <hi rend="ital">D</hi> the vertex is similar to the pyramid of which the triangle <hi rend="ital">HKL</hi> is the base and the point <hi rend="ital">D</hi> the vertex. </p>
      <p>But the pyramid of which the triangle <hi rend="ital">HKL</hi> is the base and the point <hi rend="ital">D</hi> the vertex was proved similar to the pyramid of which the triangle <hi rend="ital">AEG</hi> is the base and the point <hi rend="ital">H</hi> the vertex. </p>
      <p>Therefore each of the pyramids <hi rend="ital">AEGH</hi>, <hi rend="ital">HKLD</hi> is similar to the whole pyramid <hi rend="ital">ABCD</hi>. </p>
      <p>Next, since <hi rend="ital">BF</hi> is equal to <hi rend="ital">FC</hi>, the parallelogram <hi rend="ital">EBFG</hi> is double of the triangle <hi rend="ital">GFC</hi>. </p>
      <p>And since, if there be two prisms of equal height, and one have a parallelogram as base, and the other a triangle, and if the parallelogram be double of the triangle, the prisms are equal, [<ref target="elem.11.39" targOrder="U">XI. 39</ref>] therefore the prism contained by the two triangles <hi rend="ital">BKF</hi>, <hi rend="ital">EHG</hi>, and the three parallelograms <hi rend="ital">EBFG</hi>, <hi rend="ital">EBKH</hi>, <hi rend="ital">HKFG</hi> is equal to the prism contained by the two triangles <hi rend="ital">GFC</hi>, <hi rend="ital">HKL</hi> and the three parallelograms <hi rend="ital">KFCL</hi>, <hi rend="ital">LCGH</hi>, <hi rend="ital">HKFG</hi>. </p>
      <p>And it is manifest that each of the prisms, namely that in which the parallelogram <hi rend="ital">EBFG</hi> is the base and the straight line <hi rend="ital">HK</hi> is its opposite, and that in which the triangle <hi rend="ital">GFC</hi> is the base and the triangle <hi rend="ital">HKL</hi> its opposite, is greater than each of the pyramids of which the triangles <hi rend="ital">AEG</hi>, <hi rend="ital">HKL</hi> are the bases and the points <hi rend="ital">H</hi>, <hi rend="ital">D</hi> the vertices, <hi rend="ital">EF</hi>, <hi rend="ital">EK</hi>, the prism in which the parallelogram <hi rend="ital">EBFG</hi> is the base and the straight line <hi rend="ital">HK</hi> its opposite is greater than the pyramid of which the triangle <hi rend="ital">EBF</hi> is the base and the point <hi rend="ital">K</hi> the vertex. </p>
      <p>But the pyramid of which the triangle <hi rend="ital">EBF</hi> is the base and the point <hi rend="ital">K</hi> the vertex is equal to the pyramid of which the triangle <hi rend="ital">AEG</hi> is the base and the point <hi rend="ital">H</hi> the vertex; for they are contained by equal and similar planes. </p>
      <p>Hence also the prism in which the parallelogram <hi rend="ital">EBFG</hi> is the base and the straight line <hi rend="ital">HK</hi> its opposite is greater than the pyramid of which the triangle <hi rend="ital">AEG</hi> is the base and the point <hi rend="ital">H</hi> the vertex. </p>
      <p>But the prism in which the parallelogram <hi rend="ital">EBFG</hi> is the base and the straight line <hi rend="ital">HK</hi> its opposite is equal to the prism in which the triangle <hi rend="ital">GFC</hi> is the base and the triangle <hi rend="ital">HKL</hi> its opposite, and the pyramid of which the triangle <hi rend="ital">AEG</hi> is the base and the point <hi rend="ital">H</hi> the vertex is equal to the pyramid of which the triangle <hi rend="ital">HKL</hi> is the base and the point <hi rend="ital">D</hi> the vertex. </p>
      <p>Therefore the said two prisms are greater than the said two pyramids of which the triangles <hi rend="ital">AEG</hi>, <hi rend="ital">HKL</hi> are the bases and the points <hi rend="ital">H</hi>, <hi rend="ital">D</hi> the vertices. </p>
      <p>Therefore the whole pyramid, of which the triangle <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi> is the base and the point <hi rend="ital">D</hi> the vertex, has been divided into two pyramids equal to one another and into two equal prisms, and the two prisms are greater than the half of the whole pyramid.
