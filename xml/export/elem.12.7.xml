       <hi rend="ital">Any prism which has a triangular base is divided into three pyramids equal to one another which have triangular bases.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>Let there be a prism in which the triangle <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi> is the base and <hi rend="ital">DEF</hi> its opposite; I say that the prism <hi rend="ital">ABCDEF</hi> is divided into three pyramids equal to one another, which have triangular bases. </p>
      <p>For let <hi rend="ital">BD</hi>, <hi rend="ital">EC</hi>, <hi rend="ital">CD</hi> be joined. </p>
      <p>Since <hi rend="ital">ABED</hi> is a parallelogram, and <hi rend="ital">BD</hi> is its diameter, therefore the triangle <hi rend="ital">ABD</hi> is equal to the triangle <hi rend="ital">EBD</hi>; [<ref target="elem.1.34" targOrder="U">I. 34</ref>] therefore also the pyramid of which the triangle <hi rend="ital">ABD</hi> is the base and the point <hi rend="ital">C</hi> the vertex is equal to the pyramid of which the triangle <hi rend="ital">DEB</hi> is the base and the point <hi rend="ital">C</hi> the vertex. [<ref target="elem.12.5" targOrder="U">XII. 5</ref>] </p>
      <p>But the pyramid of which the triangle <hi rend="ital">DEB</hi> is the base and the point <hi rend="ital">C</hi> the vertex is the same with the pyramid of which the triangle <hi rend="ital">EBC</hi> is the base and the point <hi rend="ital">D</hi> the vertex; for they are contained by the same planes. </p>
      <p>Therefore the pyramid of which the triangle <hi rend="ital">ABD</hi> is the base and the point <hi rend="ital">C</hi> the vertex is also equal to the pyramid of which the triangle <hi rend="ital">EBC</hi> is the base and the point <hi rend="ital">D</hi> the vertex. </p>
      <p>Again, since <hi rend="ital">FCBE</hi> is a parallelogram, and <hi rend="ital">CE</hi> is its diameter, the triangle <hi rend="ital">CEF</hi> is equal to the triangle <hi rend="ital">CBE</hi>. [<ref target="elem.1.34" targOrder="U">I. 34</ref>] </p>
      <p>Therefore also the pyramid of which the triangle <hi rend="ital">BCE</hi> is the base and the point <hi rend="ital">D</hi> the vertex is equal to the pyramid of which the triangle <hi rend="ital">ECF</hi> is the base and the point <hi rend="ital">D</hi> the vertex. [<ref target="elem.12.5" targOrder="U">XII. 5</ref>] </p>
      <p>But the pyramid of which the triangle <hi rend="ital">BCE</hi> is the base and the point <hi rend="ital">D</hi> the vertex was proved equal to the pyramid of which the triangle <hi rend="ital">ABD</hi> is the base and the point <hi rend="ital">C</hi> the vertex; <hi rend="ital">CEF</hi> is the base and the point <hi rend="ital">D</hi> the vertex is equal to the pyramid of which the triangle <hi rend="ital">ABD</hi> is the base and the point <hi rend="ital">C</hi> the vertex; therefore the prism <hi rend="ital">ABCDEF</hi> has been divided into three pyramids equal to one another which have triangular bases. </p>
      <p>And, since the pyramid of which the triangle <hi rend="ital">ABD</hi> is the base and the point <hi rend="ital">C</hi> the vertex is the same with the pyramid of which the triangle <hi rend="ital">CAB</hi> is the base and the point <hi rend="ital">D</hi> the vertex, for they are contained by the same planes, while the pyramid of which the triangle <hi rend="ital">ABD</hi> is the base and the point <hi rend="ital">C</hi> the vertex was proved to be a third of the prism in which the triangle <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi> is the base and <hi rend="ital">DEF</hi> its opposite, therefore also the pyramid of which the triangle <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi> is the base and the point <hi rend="ital">D</hi> the vertex is a third of the prism which has the same base, the triangle <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi>, and <hi rend="ital">DEF</hi> as its opposite. </p>

       <p>From this it is manifest that any pyramid is a third part of the prism which has the same base with it and equal height. Q. E. D.</p>
