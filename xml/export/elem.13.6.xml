      <p><hi rend="ital">If a rational straight line be cut in extreme and mean ratio</hi>, <hi rend="ital">each of the segments is the irrational straight line called apotome.</hi>
       </p>
      <p>Let <hi rend="ital">AB</hi> be a rational straight line, let it be cut in extreme and mean ratio at <hi rend="ital">C</hi>, and let <hi rend="ital">AC</hi> be the greater segment; I say that each of the straight lines <hi rend="ital">AC</hi>, <hi rend="ital">CB</hi> is the irrational straight line called apotome. </p>
      <p>For let <hi rend="ital">BA</hi> be produced, and let <hi rend="ital">AD</hi> be made half of <hi rend="ital">BA</hi>. </p>
      <p>Since then the straight line <hi rend="ital">AB</hi> has been cut in extreme and mean ratio, and to the greater segment <hi rend="ital">AC</hi> is added <hi rend="ital">AD</hi> which is half of <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>, therefore the square on <hi rend="ital">CD</hi> is five times the square on <hi rend="ital">DA</hi>. [<ref target="elem.13.1" targOrder="U">XIII. 1</ref>] </p>
      <p>Therefore the square on <hi rend="ital">CD</hi> has to the square on <hi rend="ital">DA</hi> the ratio which a number has to a number; therefore the square on <hi rend="ital">CD</hi> is commensurable with the square on <hi rend="ital">DA</hi>. [<ref target="elem.10.6" targOrder="U">X. 6</ref>] </p>
      <p>But the square on <hi rend="ital">DA</hi> is rational, for <hi rend="ital">DA</hi> is rational, being half of <hi rend="ital">AB</hi> which is rational; therefore the square on <hi rend="ital">CD</hi> is also rational; [<ref target="elem.10.def.4" targOrder="U">X. Def. 4</ref>] therefore <hi rend="ital">CD</hi> is also rational. </p>
      <p>And, since the square on <hi rend="ital">CD</hi> has not to the square on <hi rend="ital">DA</hi> the ratio which a square number has to a square number, therefore <hi rend="ital">CD</hi> is incommensurable in length with <hi rend="ital">DA</hi>; [<ref target="elem.10.9" targOrder="U">X. 9</ref>] therefore <hi rend="ital">CD</hi>, <hi rend="ital">DA</hi> are rational straight lines commensurable in square only; therefore <hi rend="ital">AC</hi> is an apotome. [<ref target="elem.10.73" targOrder="U">X. 73</ref>] </p>
      <p>Again, since <hi rend="ital">AB</hi> has been cut in extreme and mean ratio, and <hi rend="ital">AC</hi> is the greater segment, therefore the rectangle <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">BC</hi> is equal to the square on <hi rend="ital">AC</hi>. [<ref target="elem.6.def.3" targOrder="U">VI. Def. 3</ref>, <ref target="elem.6.17" targOrder="U">VI. 17</ref>] </p>
      <p>Therefore the square on the apotome <hi rend="ital">AC</hi>, if applied to the rational straight line <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>, produces <hi rend="ital">BC</hi> as breadth. </p>
      <p>But the square on an apotome, if applied to a rational straight line, produces as breadth a first apotome; [<ref target="elem.10.97" targOrder="U">X. 97</ref>] therefore <hi rend="ital">CB</hi> is a first apotome. </p>
      <p>And <hi rend="ital">CA</hi> was also proved to be an apotome. </p>
      <p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
