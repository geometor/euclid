      <p><emph>To construct a square equal to a given rectilineal figure</emph>.</p>
      <p>Let <emph>A</emph> be the given rectilineal figure; thus it is required to construct a square equal to the rectilineal figure <emph>A</emph>. </p>
      <p>For let there be constructed the rectangular parallelogram <emph>BD</emph> equal to the rectilineal figure <emph>A</emph>. [<ref target="elem.1.45" targOrder="U">I. 45</ref>]</p>
      <p>Then, if <emph>BE</emph> is equal to <emph>ED</emph>, that which was enjoined will have been done; for a square <emph>BD</emph> has been constructed equal to the rectilineal figure <emph>A</emph>. </p>
      <p>But, if not, one of the straight lines <emph>BE</emph>, <emph>ED</emph> is greater.</p>
      <p>Let <emph>BE</emph> be greater, and let it be produced to <emph>F</emph>; let <emph>EF</emph> be made equal to <emph>ED</emph>, and let <emph>BF</emph> be bisected at <emph>G</emph>.</p>
      <p>With centre <emph>G</emph> and distance one of the straight lines <emph>GB</emph>, <emph>GF</emph> let the semicircle <emph>BHF</emph> be described; let <emph>DE</emph> be produced <emph>H</emph>, and let <emph>GH</emph> be joined.</p>
      <p>Then, since the straight line <emph>BF</emph> has been cut into equal segments at <emph>G</emph>, and into unequal segments at <emph>E</emph>, <hi rend="center">the rectangle contained by <emph>BE</emph>, <emph>EF</emph> together with the square on <emph>EG</emph> is equal to the square on <emph>GF</emph>. [<ref target="elem.2.5" targOrder="U">II. 5</ref>]</hi>
       </p>
      <p>But <emph>GF</emph> is equal to <emph>GH</emph>; therefore the rectangle <emph>BE</emph>, <emph>EF</emph> together with the square on <emph>GE</emph> is equal to the square on <emph>GH</emph>.</p>
      <p>But the squares on <emph>HE</emph>, <emph>EG</emph> are equal to the square on <emph>GH</emph>; [<ref target="elem.1.47" targOrder="U">I. 47</ref>] <emph>BE</emph>, <emph>EF</emph> together with the square on <emph>GE</emph> is equal to the squares on <emph>HE</emph>, <emph>EG</emph>.</p>
      <p>Let the square on <emph>GE</emph> be subtracted from each; <hi rend="center">therefore the rectangle contained by <emph>BE</emph>, <emph>EF</emph> which remains is equal to the square on <emph>EH</emph>.</hi>
       </p>
      <p>But the rectangle <emph>BE</emph>, <emph>EF</emph> is <emph>BD</emph>, for <emph>EF</emph> is equal to <emph>ED</emph>; <hi rend="center">therefore the parallelogram <emph>BD</emph> is equal to the square on <emph>HE</emph>.</hi></p>
      <p>And <emph>BD</emph> is equal to the rectilineal figure <emph>A</emph>.</p>
      <p>Therefore the rectilineal figure <emph>A</emph> is also equal to the square <emph>EH</emph>.</p>
      <p>Therefore a square, namely that which can be described on <emph>EH</emph>, has been constructed equal to the given rectilineal figure <emph>A</emph>. Q. E. F.</p>
