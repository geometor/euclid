      <head>Proposition 3.</head>
      <p><emph>If a straight line be cut at random</emph>, <emph>the rectangle contained by the whole and one of the segments is equal to the rectangle contained by the segments and the square on the aforesaid segment</emph>.</p>
      <p>For let the straight line <emph>AB</emph> be cut at random at <emph>C</emph>; I say that the rectangle contained by <emph>AB</emph>, <emph>BC</emph> is equal to the rectangle contained by <emph>AC</emph>, <emph>CB</emph> together with the square on <emph>BC</emph>. </p>
      <p>For let the square <emph>CDEB</emph> be described on <emph>CB</emph>; [<ref target="elem.1.46" targOrder="U">I. 46</ref>] let <emph>ED</emph> be drawn through to <emph>F</emph>, and through <emph>A</emph> let <emph>AF</emph> be drawn parallel to either <emph>CD</emph> or <emph>BE</emph>. [<ref target="elem.1.31" targOrder="U">I. 31</ref>]</p>
      <p>Then <emph>AE</emph> is equal to <emph>AD</emph>, <emph>CE</emph>.</p>
      <p>Now <emph>AE</emph> is the rectangle contained by <emph>AB</emph>, <emph>BC</emph>, for it is contained by <emph>AB</emph>, <emph>BE</emph>, and <emph>BE</emph> is equal to <emph>BC</emph>;</p>
      <p><emph>AD</emph> is the rectangle <emph>AC</emph>, <emph>CB</emph>, for <emph>DC</emph> is equal to <emph>CB</emph>; <hi rend="center">and <emph>DB</emph> is the square on <emph>CB</emph></hi>. Therefore the rectangle contained by <emph>AB</emph>, <emph>BC</emph> is equal to the rectangle contained by <emph>AC</emph>, <emph>CB</emph> together with the square on <emph>BC</emph>.</p>
      <p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
