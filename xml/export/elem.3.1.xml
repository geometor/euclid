      <p><emph>To find the centre of a given circle</emph>. </p>
      <p>Let <emph>ABC</emph> be the given circle; thus it is required to find the centre of the circle <emph>ABC</emph>. </p>
      <p>Let a straight line <emph>AB</emph> be drawn <emph>D</emph>; from <emph>D</emph> let <emph>DC</emph> be drawn at right angles to <emph>AB</emph> and let it be drawn through to <emph>E</emph>; let <emph>CE</emph> be bisected at <emph>F</emph>; <emph>F</emph> is the centre of the circle <emph>ABC</emph>. </p>
      <p>For suppose it is not, but, if possible, let <emph>G</emph> be the centre, and let <emph>GA</emph>, <emph>GD</emph>, <emph>GB</emph> be joined. </p>
      <p>Then, since <emph>AD</emph> is equal to <emph>DB</emph>, and <emph>DG</emph> is common, <hi rend="center">the two sides <emph>AD</emph>, <emph>DG</emph> are equal to the two sides <emph>BD</emph>, <emph>DG</emph> respectively;</hi> and the base <emph>GA</emph> is equal to the base <emph>GB</emph>, for they are <hi rend="center">therefore the angle <emph>ADG</emph> is equal to the angle <emph>GDB</emph>. [<ref target="elem.1.8" targOrder="U">I. 8</ref>]</hi>
      </p>
      <p>But, when a straight line set up on a straight line makes the adjacent angles equal to one another, each of the equal angles is right; [<ref target="elem.1.def.10" targOrder="U">I. Def. 10</ref>] <hi rend="center">therefore the angle <emph>GDB</emph> is right.</hi>
       </p>
      <p>But the angle <emph>FDB</emph> is also right; therefore the angle <emph>FDB</emph> is equal to the angle <emph>GDB</emph>, the greater to the less: which is impossible. <hi rend="center">Therefore <emph>G</emph> is not the centre of the circle <emph>ABC</emph>.</hi>
       </p>
      <p>Similarly we can prove that neither is any other point except <emph>F</emph>. <hi rend="center">Therefore the point <emph>F</emph> is the centre of the circle <emph>ABC</emph>.</hi>
