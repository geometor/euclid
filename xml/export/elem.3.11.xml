      <head>PROPOSITION 11.</head>
      <p><emph>If two circles touch one another internally</emph>, <emph>and their centres be taken</emph>, <emph>the straight line joining their centres</emph>, <emph>if it be also produced</emph>, <emph>will fall on the point of contact of the circles</emph>. </p>
      <p>For let the two circles <emph>ABC</emph>, <emph>ADE</emph> touch one another internally at the point <emph>A</emph>, and let the centre <emph>F</emph> of the circle <emph>ABC</emph>, and the centre <emph>G</emph> of <emph>ADE</emph>, be taken; I say that the straight line joined from <emph>G</emph> to <emph>F</emph> and produced will fall on <emph>A</emph>. </p>
      <p>For suppose it does not, but, if possible, let it fall as <emph>FGH</emph>, and let <emph>AF</emph>, <emph>AG</emph> be joined. </p>
      <p>Then, since <emph>AG</emph>, <emph>GF</emph> are greater than <emph>FA</emph>, that is, than <emph>FH</emph>, </p>
      <p>let <emph>FG</emph> be subtracted from each; therefore the remainder <emph>AG</emph> is greater than the remainder <emph>GH</emph>. </p>
      <p>But <emph>AG</emph> is equal to <emph>GD</emph>; <hi rend="center">therefore <emph>GD</emph> is also greater than <emph>GH</emph>, the less than the greater: which is impossible.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>Therefore the straight line joined from <emph>F</emph> to <emph>G</emph> will not fall outside; <hi rend="center">therefore it will fall at <emph>A</emph> on the point of contact.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
