      <p><emph>If two circles touch one another externally</emph>, <emph>the straight line joining their centres will pass through the point of contact</emph>. </p>
      <p>For let the two circles <emph>ABC</emph>, <emph>ADE</emph> touch one another <emph>A</emph>, and let the centre <emph>F</emph> of <emph>ABC</emph>, and the centre <emph>G</emph> of <emph>ADE</emph>, be taken; <emph>F</emph> to <emph>G</emph> will pass through the point of contact at <emph>A</emph>. </p>
      <p>For suppose it does not, <emph>FCDG</emph>, and let <emph>AF</emph>, <emph>AG</emph> be joined. </p>
      <p>Then, since the point <emph>F</emph> is the centre of the circle <emph>ABC</emph>, <hi rend="center"><emph>FA</emph> is equal to <emph>FC</emph>.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>Again, since the point <emph>G</emph> is the centre of the circle <emph>ADE</emph>, <hi rend="center"><emph>GA</emph> is equal to <emph>GD</emph>.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>But <emph>FA</emph> was also proved equal to <emph>FC</emph>; <hi rend="center">therefore <emph>FA</emph>, <emph>AG</emph> are equal to <emph>FC</emph>, <emph>GD</emph>, so that the whole <emph>FG</emph> is greater than <emph>FA</emph>, <emph>AG</emph>;</hi> but it is also less [<ref target="elem.1.20" targOrder="U">I. 20</ref>]: which is impossible. </p>
      <p>Therefore the straight line joined from <emph>F</emph> to <emph>G</emph> will not fail to pass through the point of contact at <emph>A</emph>; <hi rend="center">therefore it will pass through it.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.]
