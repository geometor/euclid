      <head>PROPOSITION 13.</head>
      <p><emph>A circle does not touch a circle at more points than one</emph>, <emph>whether it touch it internally or externally</emph>. </p>
      <p>For, if possible, let the circle <emph>ABDC</emph> touch the circle <emph>EBFD</emph>, first internally, at more <emph>D</emph>, <emph>B</emph>. </p>
      <p>Let the centre <emph>G</emph> of the circle <emph>ABDC</emph>, and the centre <emph>H</emph> of <emph>EBFD</emph>, be taken. </p>
      <p>Therefore the straight line <emph>G</emph> to <emph>H</emph> will fall on <emph>B</emph>, <emph>D</emph>. [<ref target="elem.3.11" targOrder="U">III. 11</ref>] </p>
      <p>Let it so fall, as <emph>BGHD</emph>. </p>
      <p>Then, since the point <emph>G</emph> is the centre of the circle <emph>ABCD</emph>, <hi rend="center"><emph>BG</emph> is equal to <emph>GD</emph>;</hi>
       <hi rend="center">therefore <emph>BG</emph> is greater than <emph>HD</emph>; therefore <emph>BH</emph> is much greater than <emph>HD</emph>.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>Again, since the point <emph>H</emph> is the centre of the circle <emph>EBFD</emph>, <hi rend="center"><emph>BH</emph> is equal to <emph>HD</emph>;</hi>
       <hi rend="center">but it was also proved much greater than it: which is impossible.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>Therefore a circle does not touch a circle internally at more points than one. </p>
      <p>I say further that neither does it so touch it externally. </p>
      <p>For, if possible, let the circle <emph>ACK</emph> touch the circle <emph>ABDC</emph> at more points than one, namely <emph>A</emph>, <emph>C</emph>, and let <emph>AC</emph> be joined. </p>
      <p>Then, since on the circumference of each of the circles <emph>ABDC</emph>, <emph>ACK</emph> two points <emph>A</emph>, <emph>C</emph> have been taken at random, the straight line joining the points will fall within each circle; [<ref target="elem.3.2" targOrder="U">III. 2</ref>] <hi rend="center">but it fell within the circle <emph>ABCD</emph> and outside <emph>ACK</emph> [<ref target="elem.3.def.3" targOrder="U">III. Def. 3</ref>]: which is absurd.</hi>
       </p>
      <p>Therefore a circle does not touch a circle externally at more points than one. </p>
      <p>And it was proved that neither does it so touch it internally. </p>
      <p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
