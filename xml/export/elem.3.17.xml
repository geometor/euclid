      <p><emph>From a given point to draw a straight line touching a given circle</emph>. </p>
      <p>Let <emph>A</emph> be the given point, and <emph>BCD</emph> the given circle; thus it is required to draw from the point <emph>A</emph> a straight line touching the circle <emph>BCD</emph>. </p>
      <p>For let the centre <emph>E</emph> of the circle be taken; [<ref target="elem.3.1" targOrder="U">III. 1</ref>] let <emph>AE</emph> be joined, and with centre <emph>E</emph> and distance <emph>EA</emph> let the circle <emph>AFG</emph> be described; <emph>D</emph> let <emph>DF</emph> be drawn at right angles to <emph>EA</emph>, and let <emph>EF</emph>, <emph>AB</emph> be joined; I say that <emph>AB</emph> has been drawn from the point <emph>A</emph> touching the circle <emph>BCD</emph>. </p>
      <p>For, since <emph>E</emph> is the centre of the circles <emph>BCD</emph>, <emph>AFG</emph>, <hi rend="center"><emph>EA</emph> is equal to <emph>EF</emph>, and <emph>ED</emph> to <emph>EB</emph>;</hi> therefore the two sides <emph>AE</emph>, <emph>EB</emph> are equal to the two sides <emph>FE</emph>, <emph>ED</emph>: and they contain a common angle, the angle at <emph>E</emph>; <hi rend="center">therefore the base <emph>DF</emph> is equal to the base <emph>AB</emph>, and the triangle <emph>DEF</emph> is equal to the triangle <emph>BEA</emph>, and the remaining angles to the remaining angles; [<ref target="elem.1.4" targOrder="U">I. 4</ref>] therefore the angle <emph>EDF</emph> is equal to the angle <emph>EBA</emph>.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>But the angle <emph>EDF</emph> is right; <hi rend="center">therefore the angle <emph>EBA</emph> is also right.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>Now <emph>EB</emph> is a radius; and the straight line drawn at right angles to the diameter of a circle, from its extremity, touches the circle; [<ref target="elem.3.16.p.1" targOrder="U">III. 16, Por.</ref>] <hi rend="center">therefore <emph>AB</emph> touches the circle <emph>BCD</emph>.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>Therefore from the given point <emph>A</emph> the straight line <emph>AB</emph> has been drawn touching the circle <emph>BCD</emph>.</p>
