      <p><emph>In a circle the angles in the same segment are equal to one another</emph>. </p>
      <p>Let <emph>ABCD</emph> be a circle, and let the angles <emph>BAD</emph>, <emph>BED</emph> be angles in the same segment <emph>BAED</emph>; I say that the angles <emph>BAD</emph>, <emph>BED</emph> are equal to one another. </p>
      <p>For let the centre of the circle <emph>ABCD</emph> be taken, and let it be <emph>F</emph>; let <emph>BF</emph>, <emph>FD</emph> be joined. </p>
      <p>Now, since the angle <emph>BFD</emph> is at the centre, <hi rend="center">and the angle <emph>BAD</emph> at the circumference, and they have the same circumference <emph>BCD</emph> as base, therefore the angle <emph>BFD</emph> is double of the angle <emph>BAD</emph>. [<ref target="elem.3.20" targOrder="U">III. 20</ref>]</hi>
      </p>
      <p>For the same reason <hi rend="center">the angle <emph>BFD</emph> is also double of the angle <emph>BED</emph>; therefore the angle <emph>BAD</emph> is equal to the angle <emph>BED</emph>.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
