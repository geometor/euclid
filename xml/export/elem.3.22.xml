      <p><emph>The opposite angles of quadrilaterals in circles are equal to two right angles</emph>. </p>
      <p>Let <emph>ABCD</emph> be a circle, and let <emph>ABCD</emph> be a quadrilateral in it; I say that the opposite angles are equal to two right angles. </p>
      <p>Let <emph>AC</emph>, <emph>BD</emph> be joined. </p>
      <p>Then, since in any triangle the three angles are equal to two right angles, [<ref target="elem.1.32" targOrder="U">I. 32</ref>] <hi rend="center">the three angles <emph>CAB</emph>, <emph>ABC</emph>, <emph>BCA</emph> of the triangle <emph>ABC</emph> are equal to two right angles.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>But the angle <emph>CAB</emph> is equal to the angle <emph>BDC</emph>, for they are in the same segment <emph>BADC</emph>; [<ref target="elem.3.21" targOrder="U">III. 21</ref>] and the angle <emph>ACB</emph> is equal to the angle <emph>ADB</emph>, for they are in the same segment <emph>ADCB</emph>; therefore the whole angle <emph>ADC</emph> is equal to the angles <emph>BAC</emph>, <emph>ACB</emph>. </p>
      <p>Let the angle <emph>ABC</emph> be added to each; therefore the angles <emph>ABC</emph>, <emph>BAC</emph>, <emph>ACB</emph> are equal to the angles <emph>ABC</emph>, <emph>ADC</emph>. But the angles <emph>ABC</emph>, <emph>BAC</emph>, <emph>ACB</emph> are equal to two right angles; therefore the angles <emph>ABC</emph>, <emph>ADC</emph> are also equal to two right angles. </p>
      <p>Similarly we can prove that the angles <emph>BAD</emph>, <emph>DCB</emph> are also equal to two right angles. </p>
      <p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
