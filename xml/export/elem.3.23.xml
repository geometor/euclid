      <p><emph>On the same straight line there cannot be constructed two similar and unequal segments of circles on the same side</emph>. </p>
      <p>For, if possible, on the same straight line <emph>AB</emph> let two similar and unequal segments of circles <emph>ACB</emph>, <emph>ADB</emph> be constructed on the same side; <emph>ACD</emph> be drawn through, and let <emph>CB</emph>, <emph>DB</emph> be joined. </p>
      <p>Then, since the segment <emph>ACB</emph> is similar to the segment <emph>ADB</emph>, <ref target="elem.3.def.11" targOrder="U">III. Def. 11</ref>] <hi rend="center">the angle <emph>ACB</emph> is equal to the angle <emph>ADB</emph>, the exterior to the interior: which is impossible.

      </p>
      <p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
