      <p><emph>In equal circles angles standing on equal circumferences are equal to one another</emph>, <emph>whether they stand at the centres or at the circumferences</emph>. </p>
      <p>For in equal circles <emph>ABC</emph>, <emph>DEF</emph>, on equal circumferences <emph>BC</emph>, <emph>EF</emph>, let the angles <emph>BGC</emph>, <emph>EHF</emph> stand at the centres <emph>G</emph>, <emph>H</emph>, and the angles <emph>BAC</emph>, <emph>EDF</emph> at the circumferences; I say that the angle <emph>BGC</emph> is equal to the angle <emph>EHF</emph>, and the angle <emph>BAC</emph> is equal to the angle <emph>EDF</emph>. </p>
      <p>For, if the angle <emph>BGC</emph> is unequal to the angle <emph>EHF</emph>, <hi rend="center">one of them is greater.</hi> Let the angle <emph>BGC</emph> be greater : and on the straight line <emph>BG</emph>, and at the point <emph>G</emph> on it, let the angle <emph>BGK</emph> be constructed equal to the angle <emph>EHF</emph>. [<ref target="elem.1.23" targOrder="U">I. 23</ref>] </p>
      <p>Now equal angles stand on equal circumferences, when they are at the centres; [<ref target="elem.3.26" targOrder="U">III. 26</ref>] <hi rend="center">therefore the circumference <emph>BK</emph> is equal to the circumference <emph>EF</emph>.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>But <emph>EF</emph> is equal to <emph>BC</emph>; <hi rend="center">therefore <emph>BK</emph> is also equal to <emph>BC</emph>, the less to the greater : which is impossible.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>Therefore the angle <emph>BGC</emph> is not unequal to the angle <emph>EHF</emph>; <hi rend="center">therefore it is equal to it.</hi>
       </p>
      <p>And the angle at <emph>A</emph> is half of the angle <emph>BGC</emph>, <hi rend="center">and the angle at <emph>D</emph> half of the angle <emph>EHF</emph>; [<ref target="elem.3.20" targOrder="U">III. 20</ref>]</hi> therefore the angle at <emph>A</emph> is also equal to the angle at <emph>D</emph>. </p>
      <p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
