      <head>PROPOSITION 28.</head>
      <p><emph>In equal circles equal straight lines cut off equal circumferences</emph>, <emph>the greater equal to the greater and the less to the less</emph>. </p>
      <p>Let <emph>ABC</emph>, <emph>DEF</emph> be equal circles, and in the circles let <emph>AB</emph>, <emph>DE</emph> be equal straight lines cutting off <emph>ACB</emph>, <emph>DFE</emph> as greater circumferences and <emph>AGB</emph>, <emph>DHE</emph> as lesser; I say that the greater circumference <emph>ACB</emph> is equal to the greater circumference <emph>DFE</emph>, and the less circumference <emph>AGB</emph> to <emph>DHE</emph>. </p>
      <p>For let the centres <emph>K</emph>, <emph>L</emph> of the circles be taken, and let <emph>AK</emph>, <emph>KB</emph>, <emph>DL</emph>, <emph>LE</emph> be joined. </p>
      <p>Now, since the circles are equal, <hi rend="center">the radii are also equal; therefore the two sides <emph>AK</emph>, <emph>KB</emph> are equal to the two sides <emph>DL</emph>, <emph>LE</emph>;</hi> and the base <emph>AB</emph> is equal to the base <emph>DE</emph>; <hi rend="center">therefore the angle <emph>AKB</emph> is equal to the angle <emph>DLE</emph>. [<ref target="elem.1.8" targOrder="U">I. 8</ref>]</hi>
      </p>
      <p>But equal angles stand on equal circumferences, when they are at the centres; [<ref target="elem.3.26" targOrder="U">III. 26</ref>] <hi rend="center">therefore the circumference <emph>AGB</emph> is equal to <emph>DHE</emph>.</hi>
       </p>
      <p>And the whole circle <emph>ABC</emph> is also equal to the whole circle <emph>DEF</emph>; therefore the circumference <emph>ACB</emph> which remains is also equal to the circumference <emph>DFE</emph> which remains. </p>
      <p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
