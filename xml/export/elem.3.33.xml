      <p><emph>On a given straight line to describe a segment of a circle admitting an angle equal to a given rectilineal angle</emph>. </p>
      <p>Let <emph>AB</emph> be the given straight line, and the angle at <emph>C</emph> the given rectilineal angle; thus it is required to describe on the given straight line <emph>AB</emph> a segment of a circle admitting an angle equal to the angle at <emph>C</emph>. </p>
      <p>The angle at <emph>C</emph> is then acute, or right, or obtuse. </p>
      <p>First let it be acute, and, as in the first figure, on the straight line <emph>AB</emph>, and at the point <emph>A</emph>, let the angle <emph>BAD</emph> be constructed equal to the angle at <emph>C</emph>; <hi rend="center">therefore the angle <emph>BAD</emph> is also acute.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>Let <emph>AE</emph> be drawn at right angles to <emph>DA</emph>, let <emph>AB</emph> be <emph>F</emph>, let <emph>FG</emph> be drawn from the point <emph>F</emph> at right angles to <emph>AB</emph>, and let <emph>GB</emph> be joined. </p>
      <p>Then, since <emph>AF</emph> is equal to <emph>FB</emph>, and <emph>FG</emph> is common, <hi rend="center">the two sides <emph>AF</emph>, <emph>FG</emph> are equal to the two sides <emph>BF</emph>, <emph>FG</emph>;</hi> and the angle <emph>AFG</emph> is equal to the angle <emph>BFG</emph>; <hi rend="center">therefore the base <emph>AG</emph> is equal to the base <emph>BG</emph>. [<ref target="elem.1.4" targOrder="U">I. 4</ref>]</hi>
      </p>
      <p>Therefore the circle described with centre <emph>G</emph> and distance <emph>GA</emph> will pass through <emph>B</emph> also. </p>
      <p>Let it be drawn, and let it be <emph>ABE</emph>; let <emph>EB</emph> be joined. </p>
      <p>Now, since <emph>AD</emph> is drawn from <emph>A</emph>, the extremity of the diameter <emph>AE</emph>, at right angles to <emph>AE</emph>, <hi rend="center">therefore <emph>AD</emph> touches the circle <emph>ABE</emph>. [<ref target="elem.3.16.p.1" targOrder="U">III. 16, Por.</ref>]</hi>
      </p>
      <p>Since then a straight line <emph>AD</emph> touches the circle <emph>ABE</emph>, and from the point of contact at <emph>A</emph> a straight line <emph>AB</emph> is drawn across in the circle <emph>ABE</emph>, <hi rend="center">the angle <emph>DAB</emph> is equal to the angle <emph>AEB</emph> in the alternate segment of the circle. [<ref target="elem.3.32" targOrder="U">III. 32</ref>]</hi>
      </p>
      <p>But the angle <emph>DAB</emph> is equal to the angle at <emph>C</emph>; therefore the angle at <emph>C</emph> is also equal to the angle <emph>AEB</emph>. </p>
      <p>Therefore on the given straight line <emph>AB</emph> the segment <emph>AEB</emph> of a circle has been described admitting the angle <emph>AEB</emph> equal to the given angle, the angle at <emph>C</emph>. </p>
      <p>Next let the angle at <emph>C</emph> be right; <emph>AB</emph> a segment of a circle admitting an angle equal to the right angle at <emph>C</emph>. </p>
      <p>Let the angle <emph>BAD</emph> be constructed equal to the right angle at <emph>C</emph>, as is the case in the second figure; <emph>AB</emph> be bisected at <emph>F</emph>, and with centre <emph>F</emph> and distance either <emph>FA</emph> or <emph>FB</emph> let the circle <emph>AEB</emph> be described. </p>
      <p>Therefore the straight line <emph>AD</emph> touches the circle <emph>ABE</emph>, because the angle at <emph>A</emph> is right. [<ref target="elem.3.16.p.1" targOrder="U">III. 16, Por.</ref>] </p>
      <p>And the angle <emph>BAD</emph> is equal to the angle in the segment <emph>AEB</emph>, for the latter too is itself a right angle, being an angle in a semicircle. [<ref target="elem.3.31" targOrder="U">III. 31</ref>] </p>
      <p>But the angle <emph>BAD</emph> is also equal to the angle at <emph>C</emph>. </p>
      <p>Therefore the angle <emph>AEB</emph> is also equal to the angle at <emph>C</emph>. </p>
      <p>Therefore again the segment <emph>AEB</emph> of a circle has been described on <emph>AB</emph> admitting an angle equal to the angle at <emph>C</emph>. </p>
      <p>Next, let the angle at <emph>C</emph> be obtuse; <emph>AB</emph>, and at the point <emph>A</emph>, let the angle <emph>BAD</emph> be constructed equal to it, as is the case in the third figure; let <emph>AE</emph> be drawn at right angles to <emph>AD</emph>, let <emph>AB</emph> be again bisected at <emph>F</emph>, let <emph>FG</emph> be drawn at right angles to <emph>AB</emph>, and let <emph>GB</emph> be joined. </p>
      <p>Then, since <emph>AF</emph> is again equal to <emph>FB</emph>, and <emph>FG</emph> is common, <hi rend="center">the two sides <emph>AF</emph>, <emph>FG</emph> are equal to the two sides <emph>BF</emph>, <emph>FG</emph>;</hi> and the angle <emph>AFG</emph> is equal to the angle <emph>BFG</emph>; <hi rend="center">therefore the base <emph>AG</emph> is equal to the base <emph>BG</emph>. [<ref target="elem.1.4" targOrder="U">I. 4</ref>]</hi>
      </p>
      <p>Therefore the circle described with centre <emph>G</emph> and distance <emph>GA</emph> will pass through <emph>B</emph> also; let it so pass, as <emph>AEB</emph>. </p>
      <p>Now, since <emph>AD</emph> is drawn at right angles to the diameter <emph>AE</emph> from its extremity, <hi rend="center"><emph>AD</emph> touches the circle <emph>AEB</emph>. [<ref target="elem.3.16.p.1" targOrder="U">III. 16, Por.</ref>]</hi>
      </p>
      <p>And <emph>AB</emph> has been drawn across from the point of contact at <emph>A</emph>; <hi rend="center">therefore the angle <emph>BAD</emph> is equal to the angle constructed in the alternate segment <emph>AHB</emph> of the circle. [<ref target="elem.3.32" targOrder="U">III. 32</ref>]</hi>
       </p>
      <p>But the angle <emph>BAD</emph> is equal to the angle at <emph>C</emph>. </p>
      <p>Therefore the angle in the segment <emph>AHB</emph> is also equal to the angle at <emph>C</emph>. </p>
      <p>Therefore on the given straight line <emph>AB</emph> the segment <emph>AHB</emph> of a circle has been described admitting an angle equal to the angle at <emph>C</emph>. Q. E. F.</p>
