      <p><emph>If in a circle two straight lines cut one another which are not through the centre</emph>, <emph>they do not bisect one another</emph>. </p>
      <p>Let <emph>ABCD</emph> be a circle, and in it let the two straight lines <emph>AC</emph>, <emph>BD</emph>, which are not through the centre, cut one another at <emph>E</emph>; </p>
      <p>For, if possible, let them bisect one another, so that <emph>AE</emph> is equal to <emph>EC</emph>, and <emph>BE</emph> to <emph>ED</emph>; let the centre of the circle <emph>ABCD</emph> be taken [<ref target="elem.3.1" targOrder="U">III. 1</ref>], and let it be <emph>F</emph>; let <emph>FE</emph> be joined. </p>
      <p>Then, since a straight line <emph>FE</emph> through the centre bisects a straight line <emph>AC</emph> not through the centre, <hi rend="center">it also cuts it at right angles; [<ref target="elem.3.3" targOrder="U">III. 3</ref>] therefore the angle <emph>FEA</emph> is right.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>Again, since a straight line <emph>FE</emph> bisects a straight line <emph>BD</emph>, <hi rend="center">it also cuts it at right angles; [<ref target="elem.3.3" targOrder="U">III. 3</ref>] therefore the angle <emph>FEB</emph> is right.</hi>
       </p>
      <p>But the angle <emph>FEA</emph> was also proved right; <hi rend="center">therefore the angle <emph>FEA</emph> is equal to the angle <emph>FEB</emph>, the less to the greater: which is impossible.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>Therefore <emph>AC</emph>, <emph>BD</emph> do not bisect one another. </p>
      <p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
