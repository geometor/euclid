      <p><emph>If two circles cut one another</emph>, <emph>they will not have the same centre</emph>. </p>
      <p>For let the circles <emph>ABC</emph>, <emph>CDG</emph> cut one another at the points <emph>B</emph>, <emph>C</emph>; I say that they will not have the same centre. </p>
      <p>For, if possible, let it be <emph>E</emph>; let <emph>EC</emph> be joined, and let <emph>EFG</emph> be drawn through at random. </p>
      <p>Then, since the point <emph>E</emph> is the centre of the circle <emph>ABC</emph>, <hi rend="center"><emph>EC</emph> is equal to <emph>EF</emph>. [<ref target="elem.1.def.15" targOrder="U">I. Def. 15</ref>]</hi>
      </p>
      <p>Again, since the point <emph>E</emph> is the centre of the circle <emph>CDG</emph>, <hi rend="center"><emph>EC</emph> is equal to <emph>EG</emph>.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>But <emph>EC</emph> was proved equal to <emph>EF</emph> also; <hi rend="center">therefore <emph>EF</emph> is also equal to <emph>EG</emph>, the less to the greater : which is impossible.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>Therefore the point <emph>E</emph> is not the centre of the circles <emph>ABC</emph>, <emph>CDG</emph>. </p>
      <p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
