      <p><emph>If two circles touch one another</emph>, <emph>they will not have the same centre</emph>. </p>
      <p>For let the two circles <emph>ABC</emph>, <emph>CDE</emph> touch one another at the point <emph>C</emph>; I say that they will not have the same centre. </p>
      <p>For, if possible, let it be <emph>F</emph>; let <emph>FC</emph> be joined, and let <emph>FEB</emph> be drawn through at random. </p>
      <p>Then, since the point <emph>F</emph> is the centre of the circle <emph>ABC</emph>, <hi rend="center"><emph>FC</emph> is equal to <emph>FB</emph>.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>Again, since the point <emph>F</emph> is the centre of the circle <emph>CDE</emph>, <hi rend="center"><emph>FC</emph> is equal to <emph>FE</emph>.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>But <emph>FC</emph> was proved equal to <emph>FB</emph>; <hi rend="center">therefore <emph>FE</emph> is also equal to <emph>FB</emph>, the less to the greater: which is impossible.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>Therefore <emph>F</emph> is not the centre of the circles <emph>ABC</emph>, <emph>CDE</emph>. </p>
      <p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
