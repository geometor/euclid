      <head>PROPOSITION 8.</head>
      <p><emph>If a point be taken outside a circle and from the point straight lines be drawn through to the circle</emph>, <emph>one of which is through the centre and the others are drawn at random</emph>, <emph>then</emph>, <emph>of the straight lines which fall on the concave circumference</emph>, <emph>that through the centre is greatest</emph>, <emph>while of the rest</emph>
       <emph>the nearer to that through the centre is always greater than the more remote</emph>, <emph>but</emph>, <emph>of the straight lines falling on the convex circumference</emph>, <emph>that between the point and the diameter is least</emph>, <emph>while of the rest the nearer to the least is always less than the more remote</emph>, <emph>and only two equal straight lines will fall on the circle from the point</emph>, <emph>one on each side of the least</emph>. </p>
      <p>Let <emph>ABC</emph> be a circle, and let a point <emph>D</emph> be taken outside <emph>ABC</emph>; let there be drawn through from it straight lines <emph>DA</emph>, <emph>DE</emph>, <emph>DF</emph>, <emph>DC</emph>, and let <emph>DA</emph> be through the centre; I say that, of the straight lines falling on the concave circumference <emph>AEFC</emph>, the straight line <emph>DA</emph> through the centre is greatest, <emph>DE</emph> is greater than <emph>DF</emph> and <emph>DF</emph> than <emph>DC</emph>.; but, of the straight lines falling on the convex circumference <emph>HLKG</emph>, the straight line <emph>DG</emph> between the point and the diameter <emph>AG</emph> is least; and the nearer to the least <emph>DG</emph> is always less than the more remote, namely <emph>DK</emph> than <emph>DL</emph>, and <emph>DL</emph> than <emph>DH</emph>. </p>
      <p>For let the centre of the circle <emph>ABC</emph> be taken [<ref target="elem.3.1" targOrder="U">III. 1</ref>], and let it be <emph>M</emph>; let <emph>ME</emph>, <emph>MF</emph>, <emph>MC</emph>, <emph>MK</emph>, <emph>ML</emph>, <emph>MH</emph> be joined. </p>
      <p>Then, since <emph>AM</emph> is equal to <emph>EM</emph>, let <emph>MD</emph> be added to each; <hi rend="center">therefore <emph>AD</emph> is equal to <emph>EM</emph>, <emph>MD</emph>.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>But <emph>EM</emph>, <emph>MD</emph> are greater than <emph>ED</emph>; [<ref target="elem.1.20" targOrder="U">I. 20</ref>] <hi rend="center">therefore <emph>AD</emph> is also greater than <emph>ED</emph>.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>Again, since <emph>ME</emph> is equal to <emph>MF</emph>, <hi rend="center">and <emph>MD</emph> is common,</hi> therefore <emph>EM</emph>, <emph>MD</emph> are equal to <emph>FM</emph>, <emph>MD</emph>; <hi rend="center">and the angle <emph>EMD</emph> is greater than the angle <emph>FMD</emph>;</hi>
       <hi rend="center">therefore the base <emph>ED</emph> is greater than the base <emph>FD</emph>. [<ref target="elem.1.24" targOrder="U">I. 24</ref>]</hi>
      </p>
      <p>Similarly we can prove that <emph>FD</emph> is greater than <emph>CD</emph>; therefore <emph>DA</emph> is greatest, while <emph>DE</emph> is greater than <emph>DF</emph>, and <emph>DF</emph> than <emph>DC</emph>. </p>
      <p>Next, since <emph>MK</emph>, <emph>KD</emph> are greater than <emph>MD</emph>, [<ref target="elem.1.20" targOrder="U">I. 20</ref>] and <emph>MG</emph> is equal to <emph>MK</emph>, therefore the remainder <emph>KD</emph> is greater than the remainder <emph>GD</emph>, <hi rend="center">so that <emph>GD</emph> is less than <emph>KD</emph>.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>And, since on <emph>MD</emph>, one of the sides of the triangle <emph>MLD</emph>, two straight lines <emph>MK</emph>, <emph>KD</emph> were constructed meeting within the triangle, therefore <emph>MK</emph>, <emph>KD</emph> are less than <emph>ML</emph>, <emph>LD</emph>; [<ref target="elem.1.21" targOrder="U">I. 21</ref>] and <emph>MK</emph> is equal to <emph>ML</emph>; <hi rend="center">therefore the remainder <emph>DK</emph> is less than the remainder <emph>DL</emph>.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>Similarly we can prove that <emph>DL</emph> is also less than <emph>DH</emph>; <hi rend="center">therefore <emph>DG</emph> is least, while <emph>DK</emph> is less than <emph>DL</emph>, and <emph>DL</emph> than <emph>DH</emph>.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>I say also that only two equal straight lines will fall from the point <emph>D</emph> on the circle, one on each side of the least <emph>DG</emph>. </p>
      <p>On the straight line <emph>MD</emph>, and at the point <emph>M</emph> on it, let the angle <emph>DMB</emph> be constructed equal to the angle <emph>KMD</emph>, and let <emph>DB</emph> be joined. </p>
      <p>Then, since <emph>MK</emph> is equal to <emph>MB</emph>, and <emph>MD</emph> is common, <hi rend="center">the two sides <emph>KM</emph>, <emph>MD</emph> are equal to the two sides <emph>BM</emph>, <emph>MD</emph> respectively;</hi> and the angle <emph>KMD</emph> is equal to the angle <emph>BMD</emph>; <hi rend="center">therefore the base <emph>DK</emph> is equal to the base <emph>DB</emph>. [<ref target="elem.1.4" targOrder="U">I. 4</ref>]</hi>
      </p>
      <p>I say that no other straight line equal to the straight line <emph>DK</emph> will fall on the circle from the point <emph>D</emph>. </p>
      <p>For, if possible, let a straight line so fall, and let it be <emph>DN</emph>. <hi rend="center">Then, since <emph>DK</emph> is equal to <emph>DN</emph>,</hi>
      </p>
      <p>while <emph>DK</emph> is equal to <emph>DB</emph>, <hi rend="center"><emph>DB</emph> is also equal to <emph>DN</emph>,</hi> that is, the nearer to the least <emph>DG</emph> equal to the more remote: which was proved impossible. </p>
      <p>Therefore no more than two equal straight lines will fall on the circle <emph>ABC</emph> from the point <emph>D</emph>, one on each side of <emph>DG</emph> the least. </p>
      <p>Therefore etc.</p>
