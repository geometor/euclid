      <p><emph>In a given circle to inscribe an equilateral and equiangular pentagon</emph>. </p>
      <p>Let <emph>ABCDE</emph> be the given circle; thus it is required to inscribe in the circle <emph>ABCDE</emph> an equilateral and equiangular pentagon. </p>
      <p>Let the isosceles triangle <emph>FGH</emph> be set out having each of the angles at <emph>G</emph>, <emph>H</emph> double of the angle at <emph>F</emph>; [<ref target="elem.4.10" targOrder="U">IV. 10</ref>] <emph>ABCDE</emph> the triangle <emph>ACD</emph> equiangular with the triangle <emph>FGH</emph>, so that the angle <emph>CAD</emph> is equal to the angle at <emph>F</emph> and the angles at <emph>G</emph>, <emph>H</emph> respectively equal to the angles <emph>ACD</emph>, <emph>CDA</emph>; [<ref target="elem.4.2" targOrder="U">IV. 2</ref>] therefore each of the angles <emph>ACD</emph>, <emph>CDA</emph> is also double of the angle <emph>CAD</emph>. </p>
      <p>Now let the angles <emph>ACD</emph>, <emph>CDA</emph> be bisected respectively by the straight lines <emph>CE</emph>, <emph>DB</emph> [<ref target="elem.1.9" targOrder="U">I. 9</ref>], and let <emph>AB</emph>, <emph>BC</emph>, <emph>DE</emph>, <emph>EA</emph> be joined. </p>
      <p>Then, since each of the angles <emph>ACD</emph>, <emph>CDA</emph> is double of the angle <emph>CAD</emph>, and they have been bisected by the straight lines <emph>CE</emph>, <emph>DB</emph>, <emph>DAC</emph>, <emph>ACE</emph>, <emph>ECD</emph>, <emph>CDB</emph>, <emph>BDA</emph> are equal to one another. </p>
      <p>But equal angles stand on equal circumferences; [<ref target="elem.3.26" targOrder="U">III. 26</ref>] therefore the five circumferences <emph>AB</emph>, <emph>BC</emph>, <emph>CD</emph>, <emph>DE</emph>, <emph>EA</emph> are equal to one another. </p>
      <p>But equal circumferences are subtended by equal straight lines; [<ref target="elem.3.29" targOrder="U">III. 29</ref>] therefore the five straight lines <emph>AB</emph>, <emph>BC</emph>, <emph>CD</emph>, <emph>DE</emph>, <emph>EA</emph> are equal to one another; <hi rend="center">therefore the pentagon <emph>ABCDE</emph> is equilateral.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>I say next that it is also equiangular. </p>
      <p>For, since the circumference <emph>AB</emph> is equal to the circumference <emph>DE</emph>, let <emph>BCD</emph> be added to each; <hi rend="center">therefore the whole circumference <emph>ABCD</emph> is equal to the whole circumference <emph>EDCB</emph>.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>And the angle <emph>AED</emph> stands on the circumference <emph>ABCD</emph>, and the angle <emph>BAE</emph> on the circumference <emph>EDCB</emph>; <hi rend="center">therefore the angle <emph>BAE</emph> is also equal to the angle <emph>AED</emph>. [<ref target="elem.3.27" targOrder="U">III. 27</ref>]</hi>
      </p>
      <p>For the same reason each of the angles <emph>ABC</emph>, <emph>BCD</emph>, <emph>CDE</emph> is also equal to each of the angles <emph>BAE</emph>, <emph>AED</emph>; <hi rend="center">therefore the pentagon <emph>ABCDE</emph> is equiangular.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>But it was also proved equilateral; <hi rend="center">therefore in the given circle an equilateral and equiangular pentagon has been inscribed. Q. E. F.</hi></p>
