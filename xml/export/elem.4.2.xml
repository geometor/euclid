      <p><emph>In a given circle to inscribe a triangle equiangular with a given triangle</emph>. </p>
      <p>Let <emph>ABC</emph> be the given circle, and <emph>DEF</emph> the given triangle; thus it is required to inscribe in the circle <emph>ABC</emph> a triangle equiangular with the triangle <emph>DEF</emph>. </p>
      <p>Let <emph>GH</emph> be drawn touching the circle <emph>ABC</emph> at <emph>A</emph> [<ref target="elem.3.16.p.1" targOrder="U">III. 16, Por.</ref>]; <emph>AH</emph>, and at the point <emph>A</emph> on it, let the angle <emph>HAC</emph> be constructed equal to the angle <emph>DEF</emph>, and on the straight line <emph>AG</emph>, and at the point <emph>A</emph> on it, let the angle <emph>GAB</emph> be constructed equal to the angle <emph>DFE</emph>; [<ref target="elem.1.23" targOrder="U">I. 23</ref>] let <emph>BC</emph> be joined. </p>
      <p>Then, since a straight line <emph>AH</emph> touches the circle <emph>ABC</emph>, and from the point of contact at <emph>A</emph> the straight line <emph>AC</emph> is drawn across in the circle, therefore the angle <emph>HAC</emph> is equal to the angle <emph>ABC</emph> in the alternate segment of the circle. [<ref target="elem.3.32" targOrder="U">III. 32</ref>] </p>
      <p>But the angle <emph>HAC</emph> is equal to the angle <emph>DEF</emph>; therefore the angle <emph>ABC</emph> is also equal to the angle <emph>DEF</emph>. </p>
      <p>For the same reason <hi rend="center">the angle <emph>ACB</emph> is also equal to the angle <emph>DFE</emph>;</hi> therefore the remaining angle <emph>BAC</emph> is also equal to the remaining angle <emph>EDF</emph>. [<ref target="elem.1.32" targOrder="U">I. 32</ref>] </p>
      <p>Therefore in the given circle there has been inscribed a triangle equiangular with the given triangle. Q. E. F.</p>
