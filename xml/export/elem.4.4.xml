      <p><emph>In a given triangle to inscribe a circle</emph>. </p>
      <p>Let <emph>ABC</emph> be the given triangle; thus it is required to inscribe a circle in the triangle <emph>ABC</emph>. </p>
      <p>Let the angles <emph>ABC</emph>, <emph>ACB</emph>
       <emph>BD</emph>, <emph>CD</emph> [<ref target="elem.1.9" targOrder="U">I. 9</ref>], and let these meet one another at the point <emph>D</emph>; from <emph>D</emph> let <emph>DE</emph>, <emph>DF</emph>, <emph>DG</emph> be drawn perpendicular to the straight <emph>AB</emph>, <emph>BC</emph>, <emph>CA</emph>. </p>
      <p>Now, since the angle <emph>ABD</emph> is equal to the angle <emph>CBD</emph>, and the right angle <emph>BED</emph> is also equal to the right angle <emph>BFD</emph>, <emph>EBD</emph>, <emph>FBD</emph> are two triangles having two angles equal to two angles and one side equal to one side, namely that subtending one of the equal angles, which is <emph>BD</emph> common to the triangles; <hi rend="center">therefore they will also have the remaining sides equal to <ref target="elem.1.26" targOrder="U">I. 26</ref>]</hi>
       <hi rend="center">therefore <emph>DE</emph> is equal to <emph>DF</emph>.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>For the same reason <hi rend="center"><emph>DG</emph> is also equal to <emph>DF</emph>.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>Therefore the three straight lines <emph>DE</emph>, <emph>DF</emph>, <emph>DG</emph> are equal <hi rend="center">therefore the circle described with centre <emph>D</emph> and distance one of the straight lines <emph>DE</emph>, <emph>DF</emph>, <emph>DG</emph> will pass also through the remaining points, and will touch the straight lines <emph>AB</emph>, <emph>BC</emph>, <emph>CA</emph>, because the angles at the points <emph>E</emph>, <emph>F</emph>, <emph>G</emph>
        </hi>
      </p>
      <p>For, if it cuts them, the straight line drawn at right angles to the diameter of the circle from its extremity will be found to fall within the circle : which was proved absurd; [<ref target="elem.3.16" targOrder="U">III. 16</ref>] <hi rend="center">therefore the circle described with centre <emph>D</emph> and distance <emph>DE</emph>, <emph>DF</emph>, <emph>DG</emph> will not cut the straight lines <emph>AB</emph>, <emph>BC</emph>, <emph>CA</emph>;</hi>
       <hi rend="center">therefore it will touch them, and will be the circle inscribed in the triangle <emph>ABC</emph>. [<ref target="elem.4.def.5" targOrder="U">IV. Def. 5</ref>]</hi>
      </p>
      <p>Let it be inscribed, as <emph>FGE</emph>. </p>
      <p>Therefore in the given triangle <emph>ABC</emph> the circle <emph>EFG</emph> has been inscribed. Q. E. F.
