      <p><emph>About a given triangle to circumscribe a circle</emph>. </p>
      <p>Let <emph>ABC</emph> be the given triangle; thus it is required to circumscribe a circle about the given triangle <emph>ABC</emph>. </p>
      <p>Let the straight lines <emph>AB</emph>, <emph>AC</emph> be bisected at the points <emph>D</emph>, <emph>E</emph> [<ref target="elem.1.10" targOrder="U">I. 10</ref>], and from the points <emph>D</emph>, <emph>E</emph> let <emph>DF</emph>, <emph>EF</emph> be drawn at right angles to <emph>AB</emph>, <emph>AC</emph>; they will then meet within the triangle <emph>ABC</emph>, or on the straight line <emph>BC</emph>, or outside <emph>BC</emph>. </p>
      <p>First let them meet within at <emph>F</emph>, and let <emph>FB</emph>, <emph>FC</emph>, <emph>FA</emph> be joined. </p>
      <p>Then, since <emph>AD</emph> is equal to <emph>DB</emph>, and <emph>DF</emph> is common and at right angles, therefore the base <emph>AF</emph> is equal to the base <emph>FB</emph>. [<ref target="elem.1.4" targOrder="U">I. 4</ref>] </p>
      <p>Similarly we can prove that <hi rend="center"><emph>CF</emph> is also equal to <emph>AF</emph>;</hi> so that <emph>FB</emph> is also equal to <emph>FC</emph>; <hi rend="center">therefore the three straight lines <emph>FA</emph>, <emph>FB</emph>, <emph>FC</emph> are equal to one another.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>Therefore the circle described with centre <emph>F</emph> and distance one of the straight lines <emph>FA</emph>, <emph>FB</emph>, <emph>FC</emph> will pass also through the remaining points, and the circle will have been circumscribed about the triangle <emph>ABC</emph>. </p>
      <p>Let it be circumscribed, as <emph>ABC</emph>. </p>
      <p>Next, let <emph>DF</emph>, <emph>EF</emph> meet on the straight line <emph>BC</emph> at <emph>F</emph>, as is the case in the second figure; and let <emph>AF</emph> be joined. </p>
      <p>Then, similarly, we shall prove that the point <emph>F</emph> is the centre of the circle circumscribed about the triangle <emph>ABC</emph>. </p>
      <p>Again, let <emph>DF</emph>, <emph>EF</emph> meet outside the triangle <emph>ABC</emph> at <emph>F</emph>, as is the case in the third figure, and let <emph>AF</emph>, <emph>BF</emph>, <emph>CF</emph> be joined. </p>
      <p>Then again, since <emph>AD</emph> is equal to <emph>DB</emph>, and <emph>DF</emph> is common and at right angles, therefore the base <emph>AF</emph> is equal to the base <emph>BF</emph>. [<ref target="elem.1.4" targOrder="U">I. 4</ref>] </p>
      <p>Similarly we can prove that <hi rend="center"><emph>CF</emph> is also equal to <emph>AF</emph>;</hi> so that <emph>BF</emph> is also equal to <emph>FC</emph>; therefore the circle described with centre <emph>F</emph> and distance one of the straight lines <emph>FA</emph>, <emph>FB</emph>, <emph>FC</emph> will pass also through the remaining points, and will have been circumscribed about the triangle <emph>ABC</emph>. </p>
      <p>Therefore about the given triangle a circle has been circumscribed. Q. E. F. </p>
      <p>And it is manifest that, when the centre of the circle falls within the triangle, the angle <emph>BAC</emph>, being in a segment greater than the semicircle, is less than a right angle; <emph>BC</emph>, the angle <emph>BAC</emph>, being in a semicircle, is right; and when the centre of the circle falls outside the triangle, the angle <emph>BAC</emph>, being in a segment less than the semicircle, is greater than a right angle.
