      <p><emph>In a given square to inscribe a circle</emph>. </p>
      <p>Let <emph>ABCD</emph> be the given square; thus it is required to inscribe a circle in the given square <emph>ABCD</emph>. </p>
      <p>Let the straight lines <emph>AD</emph>, <emph>AB</emph> be bisected at the points <emph>E</emph>, <emph>F</emph> respectively [<ref target="elem.1.10" targOrder="U">I. 10</ref>], through <emph>E</emph> let <emph>EH</emph> be drawn parallel to either <emph>AB</emph> or <emph>CD</emph>, and through <emph>F</emph> let <emph>FK</emph> be drawn parallel to either <emph>AD</emph> or <emph>BC</emph>; [<ref target="elem.1.31" targOrder="U">I. 31</ref>] therefore each of the figures <emph>AK</emph>, <emph>KB</emph>, <emph>AH</emph>, <emph>HD</emph>, <emph>AG</emph>, <emph>GC</emph>, <emph>BG</emph>, <emph>GD</emph> is a parallelogram, and their opposite sides are evidently equal. [<ref target="elem.1.34" targOrder="U">I. 34</ref>] </p>
      <p>Now, since <emph>AD</emph> is equal to <emph>AB</emph>, and <emph>AE</emph> is half of <emph>AD</emph>, and <emph>AF</emph> half of <emph>AB</emph>, <hi rend="center">therefore <emph>AE</emph> is equal to <emph>AF</emph>, so that the opposite sides are also equal;</hi>
       <hi rend="center">therefore <emph>FG</emph> is equal to <emph>GE</emph>.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>Similarly we can prove that each of the straight lines <emph>GH</emph>, <emph>GK</emph> is equal to each of the straight lines <emph>FG</emph>, <emph>GE</emph>; <hi rend="center">therefore the four straight lines <emph>GE</emph>, <emph>GF</emph>, <emph>GH</emph>, <emph>GK</emph> are equal to one another.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>Therefore the circle described with centre <emph>G</emph> and distance one of the straight lines <emph>GE</emph>, <emph>GF</emph>, <emph>GH</emph>, <emph>GK</emph> will pass also through the remaining points. </p>
      <p>And it will touch the straight lines <emph>AB</emph>, <emph>BC</emph>, <emph>CD</emph>, <emph>DA</emph>, because the angles at <emph>E</emph>, <emph>F</emph>, <emph>H</emph>, <emph>K</emph> are right. </p>
      <p>For, if the circle cuts <emph>AB</emph>, <emph>BC</emph>, <emph>CD</emph>, <emph>DA</emph>, the straight line drawn at right angles to the diameter of the circle from its extremity will fall within the circle : which was proved absurd; [<ref target="elem.3.16" targOrder="U">III. 16</ref>] therefore the circle described with centre <emph>G</emph> and distance one of the straight lines <emph>GE</emph>, <emph>GF</emph>, <emph>GH</emph>, <emph>GK</emph> will not cut the straight lines <emph>AB</emph>, <emph>BC</emph>, <emph>CD</emph>, <emph>DA</emph>. </p>
      <p>Therefore it will touch them, and will have been inscribed in the square <emph>ABCD</emph>. </p>
      <p>Therefore in the given square a circle has been inscribed. Q. E. F.</p>
