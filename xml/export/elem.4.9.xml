      <p><emph>About a given square to circumscribe a circle</emph>. </p>
      <p>Let <emph>ABCD</emph> be the given square; thus it is required to circumscribe a circle about the square <emph>ABCD</emph>. </p>
      <p>For let <emph>AC</emph>, <emph>BD</emph> be joined, and let them cut one another at <emph>E</emph>. </p>
      <p>Then, since <emph>DA</emph> is equal to <emph>AB</emph>, and <emph>AC</emph> is common, therefore the two sides <emph>DA</emph>, <emph>AC</emph> are equal to the two sides <emph>BA</emph>, <emph>AC</emph>; and the base <emph>DC</emph> is equal to the base <emph>BC</emph>; <hi rend="center">therefore the angle <emph>DAC</emph> is equal to the angle <emph>BAC</emph>. [<ref target="elem.1.8" targOrder="U">I. 8</ref>]</hi>
      </p>
      <p>Therefore the angle <emph>DAB</emph> is bisected by <emph>AC</emph>. </p>
      <p>Similarly we can prove that each of the angles <emph>ABC</emph>, <emph>BCD</emph>, <emph>CDA</emph> is bisected by the straight lines <emph>AC</emph>, <emph>DB</emph>. </p>
      <p>Now, since the angle <emph>DAB</emph> is equal to the angle <emph>ABC</emph>, and the angle <emph>EAB</emph> is half the angle <emph>DAB</emph>, and the angle <emph>EBA</emph> half the angle <emph>ABC</emph>, therefore the angle <emph>EAB</emph> is also equal to the angle <emph>EBA</emph>; so that the side <emph>EA</emph> is also equal to <emph>EB</emph>. [<ref target="elem.1.6" targOrder="U">I. 6</ref>] </p>
      <p>Similarly we can prove that each of the straight lines <emph>EA</emph>, <emph>EB</emph> is equal to each of the straight lines <emph>EC</emph>, <emph>ED</emph>. </p>
      <p>Therefore the four straight lines <emph>EA</emph>, <emph>EB</emph>, <emph>EC</emph>, <emph>ED</emph> are equal to one another. </p>
      <p>Therefore the circle described with centre <emph>E</emph> and distance one of the straight lines <emph>EA</emph>, <emph>EB</emph>, <emph>EC</emph>, <emph>ED</emph> will pass also through the remaining points; and it will have been circumscribed about the square <emph>ABCD</emph>. </p>
      <p>Let it be circumscribed, as <emph>ABCD</emph>. </p>
      <p>Therefore about the given square a circle has been circumscribed. Q. E. F.</p>
