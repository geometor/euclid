      <head>PROPOSITION I.</head>
      <p><emph>If there be any number of magnitudes whatever which are</emph>, <emph>respectively</emph>, <emph>equimultiples of any magnitudes equal in multitude</emph>, <emph>then</emph>, <emph>whatever multiple one of the magnitudes is of one</emph>, <emph>that multiple also will all be of all</emph>. </p>
      <p>Let any number of magnitudes whatever <emph>AB</emph>, <emph>CD</emph> be respectively equimultiples of any magnitudes <emph>E</emph>, <emph>F</emph> equal in multitude; I say that, whatever multiple <emph>AB</emph> is of <emph>E</emph>, that multiple will <emph>AB</emph>, <emph>CD</emph> also be of <emph>E</emph>, <emph>F</emph>. </p>
      <p>For, since <emph>AB</emph> is the same multiple of <emph>E</emph> that <emph>CD</emph> is of <emph>F</emph>, as many magnitudes as there are in <emph>AB</emph> equal to <emph>E</emph>, so many also are there in <emph>CD</emph> equal to <emph>F</emph>. </p>
      <p>Let <emph>AB</emph> be divided into the magnitudes <emph>AG</emph>, <emph>GB</emph> equal to <emph>E</emph>, and <emph>CD</emph> into <emph>CH</emph>, <emph>HD</emph> equal to <emph>F</emph>; then the multitude of the magnitudes <emph>AG</emph>, <emph>GB</emph> will be equal to the multitude of the magnitudes <emph>CH</emph>, <emph>HD</emph>. </p>
      <p>Now, since <emph>AG</emph> is equal to <emph>E</emph>, and <emph>CH</emph> to <emph>F</emph>, therefore <emph>AG</emph> is equal to <emph>E</emph>, and <emph>AG</emph>, <emph>CH</emph> to <emph>E</emph>, <emph>F</emph>. </p>
      <p>For the same reason </p>
      <p><emph>GB</emph> is equal to <emph>E</emph>, and <emph>GB</emph>, <emph>HD</emph> to <emph>E</emph>, <emph>F</emph>; therefore, as many magnitudes as there are in <emph>AB</emph> equal to <emph>E</emph>, so many also are there in <emph>AB</emph>, <emph>CD</emph> equal to <emph>E</emph>, <emph>F</emph>; <emph>AB</emph> is of <emph>E</emph>, that multiple will <emph>AB</emph>, <emph>CD</emph> also be of <emph>E</emph>, <emph>F</emph>. </p>
      <p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
