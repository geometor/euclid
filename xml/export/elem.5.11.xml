      <p><emph>Ratios which are the same with the same ratio are also the same with one another</emph>. </p>
      <p>For, as <emph>A</emph> is to <emph>B</emph>, so let <emph>C</emph> be to <emph>D</emph>, and, as <emph>C</emph> is to <emph>D</emph>, so let <emph>E</emph> be to <emph>F</emph>; I say that, as <emph>A</emph> is to <emph>B</emph>, so is <emph>E</emph> to <emph>F</emph>. </p>
      <p>For of <emph>A</emph>, <emph>C</emph>, <emph>E</emph> let equimultiples <emph>G</emph>, <emph>H</emph>, <emph>K</emph> be taken, and of <emph>B</emph>, <emph>D</emph>, <emph>F</emph> other, chance, equimultiples <emph>L</emph>, <emph>M</emph>, <emph>N</emph>. </p>
      <p>Then since, as <emph>A</emph> is to <emph>B</emph>, so is <emph>C</emph> to <emph>D</emph>, and of <emph>A</emph>, <emph>C</emph> equimultiples <emph>G</emph>, <emph>H</emph> have been taken, and of <emph>B</emph>, <emph>D</emph> other, chance, equimultiples <emph>L</emph>, <emph>M</emph>, therefore, if <emph>G</emph> is in excess of <emph>L</emph>, <emph>H</emph> is also in excess of <emph>M</emph>, if equal, equal, and if less, less. </p>
      <p>Again, since, as <emph>C</emph> is to <emph>D</emph>, so is <emph>E</emph> to <emph>F</emph>, and of <emph>C</emph>, <emph>E</emph> equimultiples <emph>H</emph>, <emph>K</emph> have been taken, and of <emph>D</emph>, <emph>F</emph> other, chance, equimultiples <emph>M</emph>, <emph>N</emph>, therefore, if <emph>H</emph> is in excess of <emph>M</emph>, <emph>K</emph> is also in excess of <emph>N</emph>, if equal, equal, and if less, less. </p>
      <p>But we saw that, if <emph>H</emph> was in excess of <emph>M</emph>, <emph>G</emph> was also in excess of <emph>L</emph>; if equal, equal; and if less, less; so that, in addition, if <emph>G</emph> is in excess of <emph>L</emph>, <emph>K</emph> is also in excess of <emph>N</emph>, if equal, equal, and if less, less. </p>
      <p>And <emph>G</emph>, <emph>K</emph> are equimultiples of <emph>A</emph>, <emph>E</emph>, while <emph>L</emph>, <emph>N</emph> are other, chance, equimultiples of <emph>B</emph>, <emph>F</emph>; <hi rend="center">therefore, as <emph>A</emph> is to <emph>B</emph>, so is <emph>E</emph> to <emph>F</emph>.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
