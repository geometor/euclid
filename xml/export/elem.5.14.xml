      <head>PROPOSITION 14.</head>
      <p><emph>If a first magnitude have to a second the same ratio as a third has to a fourth</emph>, <emph>and the first be greater than the third</emph>, <emph>the second will also be greater than the fourth</emph>; <emph>if equal</emph>, <emph>equal</emph>; <emph>and if less</emph>, <emph>less</emph>. </p>
      <p>For let a first magnitude <emph>A</emph> have the same ratio to a second <emph>B</emph> as a third <emph>C</emph> has to a fourth <emph>D</emph>; and let <emph>A</emph> be greater than <emph>C</emph>; I say that <emph>B</emph> is also greater than <emph>D</emph>. </p>
      <p>For, since <emph>A</emph> is greater than <emph>C</emph>, and <emph>B</emph> is another, chance, magnitude, therefore <emph>A</emph> has to <emph>B</emph> a greater ratio than <emph>C</emph> has to <emph>B</emph>. [<ref target="elem.5.8" targOrder="U">V. 8</ref>] </p>
      <p>But, as <emph>A</emph> is to <emph>B</emph>, so is <emph>C</emph> to <emph>D</emph>; <hi rend="center">therefore <emph>C</emph> has also to <emph>D</emph> a greater ratio than <emph>C</emph> has to <emph>B</emph>. [<ref target="elem.5.13" targOrder="U">V. 13</ref>]</hi>
      </p>
      <p>But that to which the same has a greater ratio is less; [<ref target="elem.5.10" targOrder="U">V. 10</ref>] <hi rend="center">therefore <emph>D</emph> is less than <emph>B</emph>; so that <emph>B</emph> is greater than <emph>D</emph>.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>Similarly we can prove that, if <emph>A</emph> be equal to <emph>C</emph>, <emph>B</emph> will also be equal to <emph>D</emph>; and, if <emph>A</emph> be less than <emph>C</emph>, <emph>B</emph> will also be less than <emph>D</emph>. </p>
      <p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
