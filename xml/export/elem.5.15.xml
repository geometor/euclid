      <head>PROPOSITION 15.</head>
      <p><emph>Parts have the same ratio as the same multiples of them taken in corresponding order</emph>. </p>
      <p>For let <emph>AB</emph> be the same multiple of <emph>C</emph> that <emph>DE</emph> is of <emph>F</emph>; I say that, as <emph>C</emph> is to <emph>F</emph>, so is <emph>AB</emph> to <emph>DE</emph>. </p>
      <p>For, since <emph>AB</emph> is the same multiple of <emph>C</emph> that <emph>DE</emph> is of <emph>F</emph>, as many magnitudes as there are in <emph>AB</emph> equal to <emph>C</emph>, so many are there also in <emph>DE</emph> equal to <emph>F</emph>. </p>
      <p>Let <emph>AB</emph> be divided into the magnitudes <emph>AG</emph>, <emph>GH</emph>, <emph>HB</emph> equal to <emph>C</emph>, and <emph>DE</emph> into the magnitudes <emph>DK</emph>, <emph>KL</emph>, <emph>LE</emph> equal to <emph>F</emph>; then the multitude of the magnitudes <emph>AG</emph>, <emph>GH</emph>, <emph>HB</emph> will be equal to the multitude of the magnitudes <emph>DK</emph>, <emph>KL</emph>, <emph>LE</emph>. </p>
      <p>And, since <emph>AG</emph>. <emph>GH</emph>, <emph>HB</emph> are equal to one another, and <emph>DK</emph>, <emph>KL</emph>, <emph>LE</emph> are also equal to one another, therefore, as <emph>AG</emph> is to <emph>DK</emph>, so is <emph>GH</emph> to <emph>KL</emph>, and <emph>HB</emph> to <emph>LE</emph>. [<ref target="elem.5.7" targOrder="U">V. 7</ref>] </p>
      <p>Therefore, as one of the antecedents is to one of the consequents, so will all the antecedents be to all the consequents; [<ref target="elem.5.12" targOrder="U">V. 12</ref>] <hi rend="center">therefore, as <emph>AG</emph> is to <emph>DK</emph>, so is <emph>AB</emph> to <emph>DE</emph>.</hi>
       </p>
      <p>But <emph>AG</emph> is equal to <emph>C</emph> and <emph>DK</emph> to <emph>F</emph>; <hi rend="center">therefore, as <emph>C</emph> is to <emph>F</emph>, so is <emph>AB</emph> to <emph>DE</emph>.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
