      <head>PROPOSITION 17.</head>
      <p><emph>If magnitudes be proportional</emph>
       <foreign lang="la">componendo</foreign>, <emph>they will also be proportional</emph>
       <foreign lang="la">separando</foreign>. </p>
      <p>Let <emph>AB</emph>, <emph>BE</emph>, <emph>CD</emph>, <emph>DF</emph> be magnitudes proportional <foreign lang="la">componendo</foreign>, so that, as <emph>AB</emph> is to <emph>BE</emph>, so is <emph>CD</emph> to <emph>DF</emph>; I say that they will also be proportional <foreign lang="la">separando</foreign>, that is, as <emph>AE</emph> is to <emph>EB</emph>, so is <emph>CF</emph> to <emph>DF</emph>. </p>
      <p>For of <emph>AE</emph>, <emph>EB</emph>, <emph>CF</emph>, <emph>FD</emph> let equimultiples <emph>GH</emph>, <emph>HK</emph>, <emph>LM</emph>, <emph>MN</emph> be taken, and of <emph>EB</emph>, <emph>FD</emph> other, chance, equimultiples, <emph>KO</emph>, <emph>NP</emph>. </p>
      <p>Then, since <emph>GH</emph> is the same multiple of <emph>AE</emph> that <emph>HK</emph> is of <emph>EB</emph>, therefore <emph>GH</emph> is the same multiple of <emph>AE</emph> that <emph>GK</emph> is of <emph>AB</emph>. [<ref target="elem.5.1" targOrder="U">V. 1</ref>] </p>
      <p>But <emph>GH</emph> is the same multiple of <emph>AE</emph> that <emph>LM</emph> is of <emph>CF</emph>; therefore <emph>GK</emph> is the same multiple of <emph>AB</emph> that <emph>LM</emph> is of <emph>CF</emph>. </p>
      <p>Again, since <emph>LM</emph> is the same multiple of <emph>CF</emph> that <emph>MN</emph> is of <emph>FD</emph>, therefore <emph>LM</emph> is the same multiple of <emph>CF</emph> that <emph>LN</emph> is of <emph>CD</emph>. [<ref target="elem.5.1" targOrder="U">V. 1</ref>] </p>
      <p>But <emph>LM</emph> was the same multiple of <emph>CF</emph> that <emph>GK</emph> is of <emph>AB</emph>; therefore <emph>GK</emph> is the same multiple of <emph>AB</emph> that <emph>LN</emph> is of <emph>CD</emph>. </p>
      <p>Therefore <emph>GK</emph>, <emph>LN</emph> are equimultiples of <emph>AB</emph>, <emph>CD</emph>. </p>
      <p>Again, since <emph>HK</emph> is the same multiple of <emph>EB</emph> that <emph>MN</emph> is of <emph>FD</emph>, <hi rend="center">and <emph>KO</emph> is also the same multiple of <emph>EB</emph> that <emph>NP</emph> is of <emph>FD</emph>, therefore the sum <emph>HO</emph> is also the same multiple of <emph>EB</emph> that <emph>MP</emph> is of <emph>FD</emph>. [<ref target="elem.5.2" targOrder="U">V. 2</ref>]</hi>
      </p>
      <p>And, since, as <emph>AB</emph> is to <emph>BE</emph>, so is <emph>CD</emph> to <emph>DF</emph>, and of <emph>AB</emph>, <emph>CD</emph> equimultiples <emph>GK</emph>, <emph>LN</emph> have been taken, and of <emph>EB</emph>, <emph>FD</emph> equimultiples <emph>HO</emph>, <emph>MP</emph>, therefore, if <emph>GK</emph> is in excess of <emph>HO</emph>, <emph>LN</emph> is also in excess of <emph>MP</emph>, if equal, equal, and if less, less. </p>
      <p>Let <emph>GK</emph> be in excess of <emph>HO</emph>; then, if <emph>HK</emph> be subtracted from each, <hi rend="center"><emph>GH</emph> is also in excess of <emph>KO</emph>.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>But we saw that, if <emph>GK</emph> was in excess of <emph>HO</emph>, <emph>LN</emph> was also in excess of <emph>MP</emph>; <hi rend="center">therefore <emph>LN</emph> is also in excess of <emph>MP</emph>,</hi>
       <emph>MN</emph> be subtracted from each, <hi rend="center"><emph>LM</emph> is also in excess of <emph>NP</emph>;</hi> so that, if <emph>GH</emph> is in excess of <emph>KO</emph>, <emph>LM</emph> is also in excess of <emph>NP</emph>. </p>
      <p>Similarly we can prove that, if <emph>GH</emph> be equal to <emph>KO</emph>, <emph>LM</emph> will also be equal to <emph>NP</emph>, and if less, less. </p>
      <p>And <emph>GH</emph>, <emph>LM</emph> are equimultiples of <emph>AE</emph>, <emph>CF</emph>, while <emph>KO</emph>, <emph>NP</emph> are other, chance, equimultiples of <emph>EB</emph>, <emph>FD</emph>; <hi rend="center">therefore, as <emph>AE</emph> is to <emph>EB</emph>, so is <emph>CF</emph> to <emph>FD</emph>.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
