      <p><emph>If a first magnitude be the same multiple of a second that a third is of a fourth</emph>, <emph>and a fifth also be the same multiple of the second that a sixth is of the fourth</emph>, <emph>the sum of the first and fifth will also be the same multiple of the second that the sum of the third and sixth is of the fourth</emph>. </p>
      <p>Let a first magnitude, <emph>AB</emph>, be the same multiple of a second, <emph>C</emph>, that a third, <emph>DE</emph>, is of a fourth, <emph>F</emph>, and let a fifth, <emph>BG</emph>, also be the same multiple of the second, <emph>C</emph>, that a sixth, <emph>EH</emph>, is of the fourth <emph>F</emph>; <emph>AG</emph>, will be the same multiple of the second, <emph>C</emph>, that the sum of the third and sixth, <emph>DH</emph>, is of the fourth, <emph>F</emph>. </p>
      <p>For, since <emph>AB</emph> is the same multiple of <emph>C</emph> that <emph>DE</emph> is of <emph>F</emph>, therefore, as many magnitudes as there are in <emph>AB</emph> equal to <emph>C</emph>, so many also are there in <emph>DE</emph> equal to <emph>F</emph>. </p>
      <p>For the same reason also, as many as there are in <emph>BG</emph> equal to <emph>C</emph>, so many are there also in <emph>EH</emph> equal to <emph>F</emph>; <emph>AG</emph> equal to <emph>C</emph>, so many also are there in the whole <emph>DH</emph> equal to <emph>F</emph>. </p>
      <p>Therefore, whatever multiple <emph>AG</emph> is of <emph>C</emph>, that multiple also is <emph>DH</emph> of <emph>F</emph>. </p>
      <p>Therefore the sum of the first and fifth, <emph>AG</emph>, is the same multiple of the second, <emph>C</emph>, that the sum of the third and sixth, <emph>DH</emph>, is of the fourth, <emph>F</emph>. </p>
      <p>Therefore etc. Q.E.D.</p>
