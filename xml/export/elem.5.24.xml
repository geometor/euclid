      <p><emph>If a first magnitude have to a second the same ratio as a third has to a fourth</emph>, <emph>and also a fifth have to the second the same ratio as a sixth to the fourth</emph>, <emph>the first and fifth added together will have to the second the same ratio as the third and sixth have to the fourth</emph>. </p>
      <p>Let a first magnitude <emph>AB</emph> have to a second <emph>C</emph> the same ratio as a third <emph>DE</emph> has to a fourth <emph>F</emph>; and let also a fifth <emph>BG</emph> have to <emph>C</emph> the same ratio as a sixth <emph>EH</emph> has to the fourth <emph>F</emph>; I say that the first and fifth added together, <emph>AG</emph>, will have to the second <emph>C</emph> the same ratio as the third and sixth, <emph>DH</emph>, has to the fourth <emph>F</emph>. </p>
      <p>For since, as <emph>BG</emph> is to <emph>C</emph>, so is <emph>EH</emph> to <emph>F</emph>, inversely, as <emph>C</emph> is to <emph>BG</emph>, so is <emph>F</emph> to <emph>EH</emph>. </p>
      <p>Since, then, as <emph>AB</emph> is to <emph>C</emph>, so is <emph>DE</emph> to <emph>F</emph>, <hi rend="center">and, as <emph>C</emph> is to <emph>BG</emph>, so is <emph>F</emph> to <emph>EH</emph>,</hi> therefore, <foreign lang="la">ex aequali</foreign>, as <emph>AB</emph> is to <emph>BG</emph>, so is <emph>DE</emph> to <emph>EH</emph>. [<ref target="elem.5.22" targOrder="U">V. 22</ref>] </p>
      <p>And, since the magnitudes are proportional <foreign lang="la">separando</foreign>, they will also be proportional <foreign lang="la">componendo</foreign>; [<ref target="elem.5.18" targOrder="U">V. 18</ref>] <hi rend="center">therefore, as <emph>AG</emph> is to <emph>GB</emph>, so is <emph>DH</emph> to <emph>HE</emph>.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>But also, as <emph>BG</emph> is to <emph>C</emph>, so is <emph>EH</emph> to <emph>F</emph>; therefore, <foreign lang="la">ex aequali</foreign>, as <emph>AG</emph> is to <emph>C</emph>, so is <emph>DH</emph> to <emph>F</emph>. [<ref target="elem.5.22" targOrder="U">V. 22</ref>] </p>
      <p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
