      <p><emph>If four magnitudes be proportional</emph>, <emph>the greatest and the least are greater than the remaining two</emph>. </p>
      <p>Let the four magnitudes <emph>AB</emph>, <emph>CD</emph>, <emph>E</emph>, <emph>F</emph> be proportional so that, as <emph>AB</emph> is to <emph>CD</emph>, so is <emph>E</emph> to <emph>F</emph>, and let <emph>AB</emph> be the greatest of them and <emph>F</emph> the least; I say that <emph>AB</emph>, <emph>F</emph> are greater than <emph>CD</emph>, <emph>E</emph>. </p>
      <p>For let <emph>AG</emph> be made equal to <emph>E</emph>, and <emph>CH</emph> equal to <emph>F</emph>. </p>
      <p>Since, as <emph>AB</emph> is to <emph>CD</emph>, so is <emph>E</emph> to <emph>F</emph>, and <emph>E</emph> is equal to <emph>AG</emph>, and <emph>F</emph> to <emph>CH</emph>, <hi rend="center">therefore, as <emph>AB</emph> is to <emph>CD</emph>, so is <emph>AG</emph> to <emph>CH</emph>.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>And since, as the whole <emph>AB</emph> is to the whole <emph>CD</emph>, so is the part <emph>AG</emph> subtracted to the part <emph>CH</emph> subtracted, <hi rend="center">the remainder <emph>GB</emph> will also be to the remainder <emph>HD</emph> as the whole <emph>AB</emph> is to the whole <emph>CD</emph>. [<ref target="elem.5.19" targOrder="U">V. 19</ref>]</hi>
      </p>
      <p>But <emph>AB</emph> is greater than <emph>CD</emph>; <hi rend="center">therefore <emph>GB</emph> is also greater than <emph>HD</emph>.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>And, since <emph>AG</emph> is equal to <emph>E</emph>, and <emph>CH</emph> to <emph>F</emph>, therefore <emph>AG</emph>, <emph>F</emph> are equal to <emph>CH</emph>, <emph>E</emph>. </p>
      <p>And if, <emph>GB</emph>, <emph>HD</emph> being unequal, and <emph>GB</emph> greater, <emph>AG</emph>, <emph>F</emph> be added to <emph>GB</emph> and <emph>CH</emph>, <emph>E</emph> be added to <emph>HD</emph>, <hi rend="center">it follows that <emph>AB</emph>, <emph>F</emph> are greater than <emph>CD</emph>, <emph>E</emph>.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
