      <p><emph>If two magnitudes be equimultiples of two magnitudes</emph>, <emph>and any magnitudes subtracted from them be equimultiples of the same</emph>, <emph>the remainders also are either equal to the same or equimultiples of them</emph>. </p>
      <p>For let two magnitudes <emph>AB</emph>, <emph>CD</emph> be equimultiples of two magnitudes <emph>E</emph>, <emph>F</emph>, and let <emph>AG</emph>, <emph>CH</emph> subtracted from them be equimultiples of the same two <emph>E</emph>, <emph>F</emph>; <emph>GB</emph>, <emph>HD</emph>, are either equal to <emph>E</emph>, <emph>F</emph> or equimultiples of them. </p>
      <p>For, first, let <emph>GB</emph> be equal to <emph>E</emph>; I say that <emph>HD</emph> is also equal to <emph>F</emph>. </p>
      <p>For let <emph>CK</emph> be made equal to <emph>F</emph>. </p>
      <p>Since <emph>AG</emph> is the same multiple of <emph>E</emph> that <emph>CH</emph> is of <emph>F</emph>, while <emph>GB</emph> is equal to <emph>E</emph> and <emph>KC</emph> to <emph>F</emph>, therefore <emph>AB</emph> is the same multiple of <emph>E</emph> that <emph>KH</emph> is of <emph>F</emph>. [<ref target="elem.5.2" targOrder="U">V. 2</ref>] </p>
      <p>But, by hypothesis, <emph>AB</emph> is the same multiple of <emph>E</emph> that <emph>CD</emph> is of <emph>F</emph>; therefore <emph>KH</emph> is the same multiple of <emph>F</emph> that <emph>CD</emph> is of <emph>F</emph>. </p>
      <p>Since then each of the magnitudes <emph>KH</emph>, <emph>CD</emph> is the same multiple of <emph>F</emph>, <hi rend="center">therefore <emph>KH</emph> is equal to <emph>CD</emph>.</hi>
       </p>
      <p>Let <emph>CH</emph> be subtracted from each; therefore the remainder <emph>KC</emph> is equal to the remainder <emph>HD</emph>. </p>
      <p>But <emph>F</emph> is equal to <emph>KC</emph>; therefore <emph>HD</emph> is also equal to <emph>F</emph>. </p>
      <p>Hence, if <emph>GB</emph> is equal to <emph>E</emph>, <emph>HD</emph> is also equal to <emph>F</emph>. </p>
      <p>Similarly we can prove that, even if <emph>GB</emph> be a multiple of <emph>E</emph>, <emph>HD</emph> is also the same multiple of <emph>F</emph>. </p>
      <p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
