      <p><emph>Equal magnitudes have to the same the same ratio</emph>, <emph>as also has the same to equal magnitudes</emph>. </p>
      <p>Let <emph>A</emph>, <emph>B</emph> be equal magnitudes and <emph>C</emph> any other, chance, magnitude; I say that each of the magnitudes <emph>A</emph>, <emph>B</emph> has the same ratio to <emph>C</emph>, and <emph>C</emph> has the same ratio to each of the magnitudes <emph>A</emph>, <emph>B</emph>. </p>
      <p>For let equimultiples <emph>D</emph>, <emph>E</emph> of <emph>A</emph>, <emph>B</emph> be taken, and of <emph>C</emph> another, chance, multiple <emph>F</emph>. </p>
      <p>Then, since <emph>D</emph> is the same multiple of <emph>A</emph> that <emph>E</emph> is of <emph>B</emph>, while <emph>A</emph> is equal to <emph>B</emph>, <hi rend="center">therefore <emph>D</emph> is equal to <emph>E</emph>.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>But <emph>F</emph> is another, chance, magnitude. </p>
      <p>If therefore <emph>D</emph> is in excess of <emph>F</emph>, <emph>E</emph> is also in excess of <emph>F</emph>, if equal to it, equal; and, if less, less. </p>
      <p>And <emph>D</emph>, <emph>E</emph> are equimultiples of <emph>A</emph>, <emph>B</emph>, while <emph>F</emph> is another, chance, multiple of <emph>C</emph>; <hi rend="center">therefore, as <emph>A</emph> is to <emph>C</emph>, so is <emph>B</emph> to <emph>C</emph>. [<ref target="elem.5.def.5" targOrder="U">V. Def. 5</ref>]</hi>
      </p>
      <p>I say next that <emph>C</emph> also has the same ratio to each of the magnitudes <emph>A</emph>, <emph>B</emph>. </p>
      <p>For, with the same construction, we can prove similarly that <emph>D</emph> is equal to <emph>E</emph>; and <emph>F</emph> is some other magnitude. </p>
      <p>If therefore <emph>F</emph> is in excess of <emph>D</emph>, it is also in excess of <emph>E</emph>, if equal, equal; and, if less, less. </p>
      <p>And <emph>F</emph> is a multiple of <emph>C</emph>, while <emph>D</emph>, <emph>E</emph> are other, chance, equimultiples of <emph>A</emph>, <emph>B</emph>; <hi rend="center">therefore, as <emph>C</emph> is to <emph>A</emph>, so is <emph>C</emph> to <emph>B</emph>.

      <p>Therefore etc. </p>

       <p>From this it is manifest that, if any magnitudes are proportional, they will also be proportional inversely. Q. E. D.</p>
