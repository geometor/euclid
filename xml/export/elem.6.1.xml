      <p><emph>Triangles and parallelograms which are under the same height are to one another as their bases</emph>. </p>
      <p>Let <emph>ABC</emph>, <emph>ACD</emph> be triangles and <emph>EC</emph>, <emph>CF</emph> parallelograms under the same height; <emph>BC</emph> is to the base <emph>CD</emph>, so is the triangle <emph>ABC</emph> to the triangle <emph>ACD</emph>, and the parallelogram <emph>EC</emph> to the parallelogram <emph>CF</emph>. </p>
      <p>For let <emph>BD</emph> be produced in both directions to the points <emph>H</emph>, <emph>L</emph> and let [any number of straight lines] <emph>BG</emph>, <emph>GH</emph> be <emph>BC</emph>, and any number of straight lines <emph>DK</emph>, <emph>KL</emph> equal to the base <emph>CD</emph>; let <emph>AG</emph>, <emph>AH</emph>, <emph>AK</emph>, <emph>AL</emph> be joined. </p>
      <p>Then, since <emph>CB</emph>, <emph>BG</emph>, <emph>GH</emph> are equal to one another, <hi rend="center">the triangles <emph>ABC</emph>, <emph>AGB</emph>, <emph>AHG</emph> are also equal to one <ref target="elem.1.38" targOrder="U">I. 38</ref>]</hi>
      </p>
      <p>Therefore, whatever multiple the base <emph>HC</emph> is of the base <emph>BC</emph>, that multiple also is the triangle <emph>AHC</emph> of the triangle <emph>ABC</emph>. </p>
      <p>For the same reason, <emph>LC</emph> is of the base <emph>CD</emph>, that multiple also is the triangle <emph>ALC</emph> of the triangle <emph>ACD</emph>; and, if the base <emph>HC</emph> is equal to the base <emph>CL</emph>, the triangle <emph>AHC</emph> is also equal to the triangle <emph>ACL</emph>, [<ref target="elem.1.38" targOrder="U">I. 38</ref>] <emph>HC</emph> is in excess of the base <emph>CL</emph>, the triangle <emph>AHC</emph>
       <emph>ACL</emph>, and, if less, less. </p>
      <p>Thus, there being four magnitudes, two bases <emph>BC</emph>, <emph>CD</emph> and two triangles <emph>ABC</emph>, <emph>ACD</emph>, equimultiples have been taken of the base <emph>BC</emph> and the <emph>ABC</emph>, namely the base <emph>HC</emph> and the triangle <emph>AHC</emph>, and of the base <emph>CD</emph> and the triangle <emph>ADC</emph> other, chance, equimultiples, namely the base <emph>LC</emph> and the triangle <emph>ALC</emph>; <hi rend="center">and it has been proved that,</hi> if the base <emph>HC</emph> is in excess of the base <emph>CL</emph>, the triangle <emph>AHC</emph>
       <emph>ALC</emph>; if equal, equal; and, if less, less. </p>
      <p>Therefore, as the base <emph>BC</emph> is to the base <emph>CD</emph>, so is the triangle <emph>ABC</emph> to the triangle <emph>ACD</emph>. [<ref target="elem.5.def.5" targOrder="U">V. Def. 5</ref>] </p>
      <p>Next, since the parallelogram <emph>EC</emph> is double of the triangle <emph>ABC</emph>, [<ref target="elem.1.41" targOrder="U">I. 41</ref>] and the parallelogram <emph>FC</emph> is double of the triangle <emph>ACD</emph>, while parts have the same ratio as the same multiples of them, [<ref target="elem.5.15" targOrder="U">V. 15</ref>] therefore, as the triangle <emph>ABC</emph> is to the triangle <emph>ACD</emph>, so is <emph>EC</emph> to the parallelogram <emph>FC</emph>. </p>
      <p>Since, then, it was proved that, as the base <emph>BC</emph> is to <emph>CD</emph>, so is the triangle <emph>ABC</emph> to the triangle <emph>ACD</emph>, and, as the triangle <emph>ABC</emph> is to the triangle <emph>ACD</emph>, so is the parallelogram <emph>EC</emph> to the parallelogram <emph>CF</emph>, <emph>BC</emph> is to the base <emph>CD</emph>, so is the parallelogram <emph>EC</emph> to the parallelogram <emph>FC</emph>. [<ref target="elem.5.11" targOrder="U">V. 11</ref>] </p>
      <p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
