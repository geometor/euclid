      <p><emph>To cut a given uncut straight line similarly to a given cut straight line</emph>. </p>
      <p>Let <emph>AB</emph> be the given uncut straight line, and <emph>AC</emph> the straight line cut at the points <emph>D</emph>, <emph>E</emph>; and let them be so placed as to contain any angle; let <emph>CB</emph> be joined, and through <emph>D</emph>, <emph>E</emph> let <emph>DF</emph>, <emph>EG</emph> be drawn parallel to <emph>BC</emph>, and through <emph>D</emph> let <emph>DHK</emph> be drawn parallel to <emph>AB</emph>. [<ref target="elem.1.31" targOrder="U">I. 31</ref>] </p>
      <p>Therefore each of the figures <emph>FH</emph>, <emph>HB</emph> is a parallelogram; therefore <emph>DH</emph> is equal to <emph>FG</emph> and <emph>HK</emph> to <emph>GB</emph>. [<ref target="elem.1.34" targOrder="U">I. 34</ref>] </p>
      <p>Now, since the straight line <emph>HE</emph> has been drawn parallel to <emph>KC</emph>, one of the sides of the triangle <emph>DKC</emph>, therefore, proportionally, as <emph>CE</emph> is to <emph>ED</emph>, so is <emph>KH</emph> to <emph>HD</emph>. [<ref target="elem.6.2" targOrder="U">VI. 2</ref>] </p>
      <p>But <emph>KH</emph> is equal to <emph>BG</emph>, and <emph>HD</emph> to <emph>GF</emph>; therefore, as <emph>CE</emph> is to <emph>ED</emph>, so is <emph>BG</emph> to <emph>GF</emph>. </p>
      <p>Again, since <emph>FD</emph> has been drawn parallel to <emph>GE</emph>, one of the sides of the triangle <emph>AGE</emph>, therefore, proportionally, as <emph>ED</emph> is to <emph>DA</emph>, so is <emph>GF</emph> to <emph>FA</emph>. [<ref target="elem.6.2" targOrder="U">VI. 2</ref>] </p>
      <p>But it was also proved that, <hi rend="center">as <emph>CE</emph> is to <emph>ED</emph>, so is <emph>BG</emph> to <emph>GF</emph>; therefore, as <emph>CE</emph> is to <emph>ED</emph>, so is <emph>BG</emph> to <emph>GF</emph>, and, as <emph>ED</emph> is to <emph>DA</emph>, so is <emph>GF</emph> to <emph>FA</emph>.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>Therefore the given uncut straight line <emph>AB</emph> has been cut similarly to the given cut straight line <emph>AC</emph>. Q. E. F.</p>
