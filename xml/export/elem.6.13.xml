      <p><emph>To two given straight lines to find a mean proportional</emph>. </p>
      <p>Let <emph>AB</emph>, <emph>BC</emph> be the two given straight lines; thus it is required to find a mean proportional to <emph>AB</emph>, <emph>BC</emph>. </p>
      <p>Let them be placed in a straight line, and let the semicircle <emph>ADC</emph> be described on <emph>AC</emph>; <emph>BD</emph> be drawn from the point <emph>B</emph> at right angles to the straight line <emph>AC</emph>, and let <emph>AD</emph>, <emph>DC</emph> be joined. </p>
      <p>Since the angle <emph>ADC</emph> is an angle in a semicircle, it is right. [<ref target="elem.3.31" targOrder="U">III. 31</ref>] </p>
      <p>And, since, in the right-angled triangle <emph>ADC</emph>, <emph>DB</emph> has been drawn from the right angle perpendicular to the base, therefore <emph>DB</emph> is a mean proportional between the segments of the base, <emph>AB</emph>, <emph>BC</emph>. [<ref target="elem.6.8.p.1" targOrder="U">VI. 8, Por.</ref>] </p>
      <p>Therefore to the two given straight lines <emph>AB</emph>, <emph>BC</emph> a mean proportional <emph>DB</emph> has been found. Q. E. F.</p>
