      <p><emph>Similar triangles are to one another in the duplicate ratio of the corresponding sides</emph>. </p>
      <p>Let <emph>ABC</emph>, <emph>DEF</emph> be similar triangles having the angle at <emph>B</emph> equal to the angle at <emph>E</emph>, and such that, as <emph>AB</emph> is to <emph>BC</emph>, so <emph>DE</emph> to <emph>EF</emph>, so that <emph>BC</emph> corresponds to <emph>EF</emph>; [<ref target="elem.5.def.11" targOrder="U">V. Def. 11</ref>] I say that the triangle <emph>ABC</emph> has to the triangle <emph>DEF</emph> a ratio duplicate of that which <emph>BC</emph> has to <emph>EF</emph>. </p>
      <p>For let a third proportional <emph>BG</emph> be taken to <emph>BC</emph>, <emph>EF</emph>, so that, as <emph>BC</emph> is to <emph>EF</emph>, so is <emph>EF</emph> to <emph>BG</emph>; [<ref target="elem.6.11" targOrder="U">VI. 11</ref>] <emph>AG</emph> be joined. </p>
      <p>Since then, as <emph>AB</emph> is to <emph>BC</emph>, so is <emph>DE</emph> to <emph>EF</emph>, therefore, alternately, as <emph>AB</emph> is to <emph>DE</emph>, so is <emph>BC</emph> to <emph>EF</emph>. [<ref target="elem.5.16" targOrder="U">V. 16</ref>] </p>
      <p>But, as <emph>BC</emph> is to <emph>EF</emph>, so is <emph>EF</emph> to <emph>BG</emph>; therefore also, as <emph>AB</emph> is to <emph>DE</emph>, so is <emph>EF</emph> to <emph>BG</emph>. [<ref target="elem.5.11" targOrder="U">V. 11</ref>] </p>
      <p>Therefore in the triangles <emph>ABG</emph>, <emph>DEF</emph> the sides about the equal angles are reciprocally proportional. </p>
      <p>But those triangles which have one angle equal to one angle, and in which the sides about the equal angles are reciprocally proportional, are equal; [<ref target="elem.6.15" targOrder="U">VI. 15</ref>] <emph>ABG</emph> is equal to the triangle <emph>DEF</emph>. </p>
      <p>Now since, as <emph>BC</emph> is to <emph>EF</emph>, so is <emph>EF</emph> to <emph>BG</emph>, and, if three straight lines be proportional, the first has to the third a ratio duplicate of that which it has to the second, [<ref target="elem.5.def.9" targOrder="U">V. Def. 9</ref>] therefore <emph>BC</emph> has to <emph>BG</emph> a ratio duplicate of that which <emph>CB</emph>
       <emph>EF</emph>. </p>
      <p>But, as <emph>CB</emph> is to <emph>BG</emph>, so is the triangle <emph>ABC</emph> to the triangle <emph>ABG</emph>; [<ref target="elem.6.1" targOrder="U">VI. 1</ref>] therefore the triangle <emph>ABC</emph> also has to the triangle <emph>ABG</emph> a ratio duplicate of that which <emph>BC</emph> has to <emph>EF</emph>. </p>
      <p>But the triangle <emph>ABG</emph> is equal to the triangle <emph>DEF</emph>; therefore the triangle <emph>ABC</emph> also has to the triangle <emph>DEF</emph> a ratio duplicate of that which <emph>BC</emph> has to <emph>EF</emph>. </p>
      <p>Therefore etc. </p>
