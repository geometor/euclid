      <p><emph>If a straight line be drawn parallel to one of the sides of a triangle</emph>, <emph>it will cut the sides of the triangle proportionally; and</emph>, <emph>if the sides of the triangle be cut proportionally</emph>, <emph>the line joining the points of section will be parallel to the remaining side of the triangle</emph>. </p>
      <p>For let <emph>DE</emph> be drawn parallel to <emph>BC</emph>, one of the sides of the triangle <emph>ABC</emph>; I say that, as <emph>BD</emph> is to <emph>DA</emph>, so is <emph>CE</emph> to <emph>EA</emph>. </p>
      <p>For let <emph>BE</emph>, <emph>CD</emph> be joined. </p>
      <p>Therefore the triangle <emph>BDE</emph> is equal to <emph>CDE</emph>; for they are on the same base <emph>DE</emph> and in the same parallels <emph>DE</emph>, <emph>BC</emph>. [<ref target="elem.1.38" targOrder="U">I. 38</ref>] </p>
      <p>And the triangle <emph>ADE</emph> is another area. </p>
      <p>But equals have the same ratio to the same; [<ref target="elem.5.7" targOrder="U">V. 7</ref>] therefore, as the triangle <emph>BDE</emph> is to the triangle <emph>ADE</emph>, so is the triangle <emph>CDE</emph> to the triangle <emph>ADE</emph>. </p>
      <p>But, as the triangle <emph>BDE</emph> is to <emph>ADE</emph>, so is <emph>BD</emph> to <emph>DA</emph>; for, being under the same height, the perpendicular drawn from <emph>E</emph> to <emph>AB</emph>, they are to one another as their bases. [<ref target="elem.6.1" targOrder="U">VI. 1</ref>] </p>
      <p>For the same reason also, as the triangle <emph>CDE</emph> is to <emph>ADE</emph>, so is <emph>CE</emph> to <emph>EA</emph>. </p>
      <p>Therefore also, as <emph>BD</emph> is to <emph>DA</emph>, so is <emph>CE</emph> to <emph>EA</emph>. [<ref target="elem.5.11" targOrder="U">V. 11</ref>] </p>
      <p>Again, let the sides <emph>AB</emph>, <emph>AC</emph> of the triangle <emph>ABC</emph> be cut proportionally, so that, as <emph>BD</emph> is to <emph>DA</emph>, so is <emph>CE</emph> to <emph>EA</emph>; and let <emph>DE</emph> be joined. </p>
      <p>I say that <emph>DE</emph> is parallel to <emph>BC</emph>. </p>
      <p>For, with the same construction, since, as <emph>BD</emph> is to <emph>DA</emph>, so is <emph>CE</emph> to <emph>EA</emph>, but, as <emph>BD</emph> is to <emph>DA</emph>, so is the triangle <emph>BDE</emph> to the triangle <emph>ADE</emph>, and, as <emph>CE</emph> is to <emph>EA</emph>, so is the triangle <emph>CDE</emph> to the triangle <emph>ADE</emph>, [<ref target="elem.6.1" targOrder="U">VI. 1</ref>] therefore also, <hi rend="center">as the triangle <emph>BDE</emph> is to the triangle <emph>ADE</emph>, so is the triangle <emph>CDE</emph> to the triangle <emph>ADE</emph>. [<ref target="elem.5.11" targOrder="U">V. 11</ref>]</hi>
      </p>
      <p>Therefore each of the triangles <emph>BDE</emph>, <emph>CDE</emph> has the same ratio to <emph>ADE</emph>. </p>
      <p>Therefore the triangle <emph>BDE</emph> is equal to the triangle <emph>CDE</emph>; [<ref target="elem.5.9" targOrder="U">V. 9</ref>] and they are on the same base <emph>DE</emph>. </p>
      <p>But equal triangles which are on the same base are also in the same parallels. [<ref target="elem.1.39" targOrder="U">I. 39</ref>] </p>
      <p>Therefore <emph>DE</emph> is parallel to <emph>BC</emph>. </p>
      <p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
