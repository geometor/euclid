      <p><emph>Similar polygons are divided into similar triangles</emph>, <emph>and into triangles equal in multitude and in the same ratio as the wholes</emph>, <emph>and the polygon has to the polygon a ratio duplicate of that which the corresponding side has to the corresponding</emph>
       <emph>side</emph>. </p>
      <p>Let <emph>ABCDE</emph>, <emph>FGHKL</emph> be similar polygons, and let <emph>AB</emph> correspond to <emph>FG</emph>; I say that the polygons <emph>ABCDE</emph>, <emph>FGHKL</emph> are divided into similar triangles, and into triangles equal in multitude and in <emph>ABCDE</emph> has to the polygon <emph>FGHKL</emph> a ratio duplicate of that which <emph>AB</emph> has to <emph>FG</emph>. </p>
      <p>Let <emph>BE</emph>, <emph>EC</emph>, <emph>GL</emph>, <emph>LH</emph> be joined. </p>
      <p>Now, since the polygon <emph>ABCDE</emph> is similar to the polygon <emph>FGHKL</emph>, the angle <emph>BAE</emph> is equal to the angle <emph>GFL</emph>; <hi rend="center">and, as <emph>BA</emph> is to <emph>AE</emph>, so is <emph>GF</emph> to <emph>FL</emph>. [<ref target="elem.6.def.1" targOrder="U">VI. Def. 1</ref>]</hi>
      </p>
      <p>Since then <emph>ABE</emph>, <emph>FGL</emph> are two triangles having one angle equal to one angle and the sides about the equal angles <emph>ABE</emph> is equiangular with the triangle <emph>FGL</emph>; [<ref target="elem.6.6" targOrder="U">VI. 6</ref>] <hi rend="center">so that it is also similar; [<ref target="elem.6.4 elem.6.def.1" targOrder="U">VI. 4 and Def. 1</ref>]</hi> therefore the angle <emph>ABE</emph> is equal to the angle <emph>FGL</emph>. </p>
      <p>But the whole angle <emph>ABC</emph> is also equal to the whole angle <emph>FGH</emph> because of the similarity of the polygons; therefore the remaining angle <emph>EBC</emph> is equal to the angle <emph>LGH</emph>. </p>
      <p>And, since, because of the similarity of the triangles <emph>ABE</emph>, <emph>FGL</emph>, <hi rend="center">as <emph>EB</emph> is to <emph>BA</emph>, so is <emph>LG</emph> to <emph>GF</emph>,</hi> and moreover also, because of the similarity of the polygons, <hi rend="center">as <emph>AB</emph> is to <emph>BC</emph>, so is <emph>FG</emph> to <emph>GH</emph>,</hi> therefore, <foreign lang="la">ex aequali</foreign>, as <emph>EB</emph> is to <emph>BC</emph>, so is <emph>LG</emph> to <emph>GH</emph>; [<ref target="elem.5.22" targOrder="U">V. 22</ref>] <emph>EBC</emph>, <emph>LGH</emph> are proportional; therefore the triangle <emph>EBC</emph> is equiangular with the triangle <emph>LGH</emph>, [<ref target="elem.6.6" targOrder="U">VI. 6</ref>] <hi rend="center">so that the triangle <emph>EBC</emph> is also similar to the triangle <emph>LGH</emph>. [<ref target="elem.6.4 elem.6.def.1" targOrder="U">VI. 4 and Def. 1</ref>]</hi>
      </p>
      <p>For the same reason the triangle <emph>ECD</emph> is also similar to the triangle <emph>LHK</emph>. </p>
      <p>Therefore the similar polygons <emph>ABCDE</emph>, <emph>FGHKL</emph> have been divided into similar triangles, and into triangles equal in </p>
      <p>I say that they are also in the same ratio as the wholes, that is, in such manner that the triangles are proportional, and <emph>ABE</emph>, <emph>EBC</emph>, <emph>ECD</emph> are antecedents, while <emph>FGL</emph>, <emph>LGH</emph>, <emph>LHK</emph> are their consequents, and that the polygon <emph>ABCDE</emph>
       <emph>FGHKL</emph> a ratio duplicate of that which the corresponding side has to the corresponding side, that is <emph>AB</emph> to <emph>FG</emph>. </p>
      <p>For let <emph>AC</emph>, <emph>FH</emph> be joined. </p>
      <p>Then since, because of the similarity of the polygons, <emph>ABC</emph> is equal to the angle <emph>FGH</emph>, and, as <emph>AB</emph> is to <emph>BC</emph>, so is <emph>FG</emph> to <emph>GH</emph>, <hi rend="center">the triangle <emph>ABC</emph> is equiangular with the triangle <emph>FGH</emph>; [<ref target="elem.6.6" targOrder="U">VI. 6</ref>] therefore the angle <emph>BAC</emph> is equal to the angle <emph>GFH</emph>, and the angle <emph>BCA</emph> to the angle <emph>GHF</emph>.</hi>
       </p>
      <p>And, since the angle <emph>BAM</emph> is equal to the angle <emph>GFN</emph>, and the angle <emph>ABM</emph> is also equal to the angle <emph>FGN</emph>, <emph>AMB</emph> is also equal to the remaining angle <emph>FNG</emph>; [<ref target="elem.1.32" targOrder="U">I. 32</ref>] therefore the triangle <emph>ABM</emph> is equiangular with the triangle <emph>FGN</emph>. </p>
      <p>Similarly we can prove that the triangle <emph>BMC</emph> is also equiangular with the triangle <emph>GNH</emph>. </p>
      <p>Therefore, proportionally, as <emph>AM</emph> is to <emph>MB</emph>, so is <emph>FN</emph> to <emph>NG</emph>, <emph>BM</emph> is to <emph>MC</emph>, so is <emph>GN</emph> to <emph>NH</emph>; so that, in addition, <foreign lang="la">ex aequali</foreign>, <hi rend="center">as <emph>AM</emph> is to <emph>MC</emph>, so is <emph>FN</emph> to <emph>NH</emph>.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>But, as <emph>AM</emph> is to <emph>MC</emph>, so is the triangle <emph>ABM</emph> to <emph>MBC</emph>, and <emph>AME</emph> to <emph>EMC</emph>; for they are to one another as their <ref target="elem.6.1" targOrder="U">VI. 1</ref>] </p>
      <p>Therefore also, as one of the antecedents is to one of the consequents, so are all the antecedents to all the consequents; [<ref target="elem.5.12" targOrder="U">V. 12</ref>] therefore, as the triangle <emph>AMB</emph> is to <emph>BMC</emph>, so is <emph>ABE</emph> to <emph>CBE</emph>. </p>
      <p>But, as <emph>AMB</emph> is to <emph>BMC</emph>, so is <emph>AM</emph> to <emph>MC</emph>; therefore also, as <emph>AM</emph> is to <emph>MC</emph>, so is the triangle <emph>ABE</emph> to the triangle <emph>EBC</emph>. </p>
      <p>For the same reason also, as <emph>FN</emph> is to <emph>NH</emph>, so is the triangle <emph>FGL</emph> to the triangle <emph>GLH</emph>. </p>
      <p>And, as <emph>AM</emph> is to <emph>MC</emph>, so is <emph>FN</emph> to <emph>NH</emph>; therefore also, as the triangle <emph>ABE</emph> is to the triangle <emph>BEC</emph>, so is the triangle <emph>FGL</emph> to the triangle <emph>GLH</emph>; and, alternately, as the triangle <emph>ABE</emph> is to the triangle <emph>FGL</emph>, <emph>BEC</emph> to the triangle <emph>GLH</emph>. </p>
      <p>Similarly we can prove, if <emph>BD</emph>, <emph>GK</emph> be joined, that, as the triangle <emph>BEC</emph> is to the triangle <emph>LGH</emph>, so also is the triangle <emph>ECD</emph> to the triangle <emph>LHK</emph>. </p>
      <p>And since, as the triangle <emph>ABE</emph> is to the triangle <emph>FGL</emph>, <emph>EBC</emph> to <emph>LGH</emph>, and further <emph>ECD</emph> to <emph>LHK</emph>, therefore also, as one of the antecedents is to one of the consequents so are all the antecedents to all the consequents; [<ref target="elem.5.12" targOrder="U">V. 12</ref> therefore, as the triangle <emph>ABE</emph> is to the triangle <emph>FGL</emph>, so is the polygon <emph>ABCDE</emph> to the polygon <emph>FGHKL</emph>. </p>
      <p>But the triangle <emph>ABE</emph> has to the triangle <emph>FGL</emph> a ratio duplicate of that which the corresponding side <emph>AB</emph> has to the corresponding side <emph>FG</emph>; for similar triangles are in the duplicate ratio of the corresponding sides. [<ref target="elem.6.19" targOrder="U">VI. 19</ref>] </p>
      <p>Therefore the polygon <emph>ABCDE</emph> also has to the polygon <emph>FGHKL</emph> a ratio duplicate of that which the corresponding side <emph>AB</emph> has to the corresponding side <emph>FG</emph>. </p>
      <p>Therefore etc. </p>

       <p>Similarly also it can be proved in the case of quadrilaterals that they are in the duplicate ratio of the </p>
