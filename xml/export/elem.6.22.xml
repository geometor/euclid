      <head>PROPOSITION 22.</head>
      <p><emph>If four straight lines be proportional</emph>, <emph>the rectilineal figures similar and similarly described upon them will also be proportional</emph>; <emph>and</emph>, <emph>if the rectilineal figures similar and similarly described upon them be proportional</emph>, <emph>the straight lines will themselves also be proportional</emph>. </p>
      <p>Let the four straight lines <emph>AB</emph>, <emph>CD</emph>, <emph>EF</emph>, <emph>GH</emph> be proportional, so that, as <emph>AB</emph> is to <emph>CD</emph>, so is <emph>EF</emph> to <emph>GH</emph>, and let there be described on <emph>AB</emph>, <emph>CD</emph> the similar and similarly situated rectilineal figures <emph>KAB</emph>, <emph>LCD</emph>, and on <emph>EF</emph>, <emph>GH</emph> the similar and similarly situated rectilineal figures <emph>MF</emph>, <emph>NH</emph>; I say that, as <emph>KAB</emph> is to <emph>LCD</emph>, so is <emph>MF</emph> to <emph>NH</emph>. </p>
      <p>For let there be taken a third proportional <emph>O</emph> to <emph>AB</emph>, <emph>CD</emph>, and a third proportional <emph>P</emph> to <emph>EF</emph>, <emph>GH</emph>. [<ref target="elem.6.11" targOrder="U">VI. 11</ref>] </p>
      <p>Then since, as <emph>AB</emph> is to <emph>CD</emph>, so is <emph>EF</emph> to <emph>GH</emph>, <hi rend="center">and, as <emph>CD</emph> is to <emph>O</emph>, so is <emph>GH</emph> to <emph>P</emph>,</hi> therefore, <emph>ex aequali</emph>, as <emph>AB</emph> is to <emph>O</emph>, so is <emph>EF</emph> to <emph>P</emph>. [<ref target="elem.5.22" targOrder="U">V. 22</ref>] </p>
      <p>But, as <emph>AB</emph> is to <emph>O</emph>, so is <emph>KAB</emph> to <emph>LCD</emph>, [<ref target="elem.6.19.p.1" targOrder="U">VI. 19, Por.</ref>] <hi rend="center">and, as <emph>EF</emph> is to <emph>P</emph>, so is <emph>MF</emph> to <emph>NH</emph>;</hi> therefore also, as <emph>KAB</emph> is to <emph>LCD</emph>, so is <emph>MF</emph> to <emph>NH</emph>. [<ref target="elem.5.11" targOrder="U">V. 11</ref>] </p>
      <p>Next, let <emph>MF</emph> be to <emph>NH</emph> as <emph>KAB</emph> is to <emph>LCD</emph>; I say also that, as <emph>AB</emph> is to <emph>CD</emph>, so is <emph>EF</emph> to <emph>GH</emph>. </p>
      <p>For, if <emph>EF</emph> is not to <emph>GH</emph> as <emph>AB</emph> to <emph>CD</emph>, <hi rend="center">let <emph>EF</emph> be to <emph>QR</emph> as <emph>AB</emph> to <emph>CD</emph>, [<ref target="elem.6.12" targOrder="U">VI. 12</ref>]</hi> and on <emph>QR</emph> let the rectilineal figure <emph>SR</emph> be described similar and similarly situated to either of the two <emph>MF</emph>, <emph>NH</emph>. [<ref target="elem.6.18" targOrder="U">VI. 18</ref>] </p>
      <p>Since then, as <emph>AB</emph> is to <emph>CD</emph>, so is <emph>EF</emph> to <emph>QR</emph>, and there have been described on <emph>AB</emph>, <emph>CD</emph> the similar and similarly situated figures <emph>KAB</emph>, <emph>LCD</emph>, and on <emph>EF</emph>, <emph>QR</emph> the similar and similarly situated figures <emph>MF</emph>, <emph>SR</emph>, therefore, as <emph>KAB</emph> is to <emph>LCD</emph>, so is <emph>MF</emph> to <emph>SR</emph>. </p>
      <p>But also, by hypothesis, <hi rend="center">as <emph>KAB</emph> is to <emph>LCD</emph>, so is <emph>MF</emph> to <emph>NH</emph>; therefore also, as <emph>MF</emph> is to <emph>SR</emph>, so is <emph>MF</emph> to <emph>NH</emph>. [<ref target="elem.5.11" targOrder="U">V. 11</ref>]</hi>
      </p>
      <p>Therefore <emph>MF</emph> has the same ratio to each of the figures <emph>NH</emph>, <emph>SR</emph>; <hi rend="center">therefore <emph>NH</emph> is equal to <emph>SR</emph>. [<ref target="elem.5.9" targOrder="U">V. 9</ref>]</hi>
      </p>
      <p>But it is also similar and similarly situated to it; <hi rend="center">therefore <emph>GH</emph> is equal to <emph>QR</emph>.</hi>
       </p>
      <p>And, since, as <emph>AB</emph> is to <emph>CD</emph>, so is <emph>EF</emph> to <emph>QR</emph>, while <emph>QR</emph> is equal to <emph>GH</emph>, therefore, as <emph>AB</emph> is to <emph>CD</emph>, so is <emph>EF</emph> to <emph>GH</emph>. </p>
      <p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
