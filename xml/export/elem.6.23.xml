      <p><emph>Equiangular parallelograms have to one another the ratio compounded of the ratios of their sides</emph>. </p>
      <p>Let <emph>AC</emph>, <emph>CF</emph> be equiangular parallelograms having the angle <emph>BCD</emph> equal to the angle <emph>ECG</emph>; <emph>AC</emph> has to the parallelogram <emph>CF</emph> the ratio compounded of the ratios of the sides. </p>
      <p>For let them be placed so that <emph>BC</emph> is in a straight line with <emph>CG</emph>; <hi rend="center">therefore <emph>DC</emph> is also in a straight line with <emph>CE</emph>.</hi>
       </p>
      <p>Let the parallelogram <emph>DG</emph> be completed; let a straight line <emph>K</emph> be set out, and let it be contrived that, <hi rend="center">as <emph>BC</emph> is to <emph>CG</emph>, so is <emph>K</emph> to <emph>L</emph>,</hi> and, as <emph>DC</emph> is to <emph>CE</emph>, so is <emph>L</emph> to <emph>M</emph>. [<ref target="elem.6.12" targOrder="U">VI. 12</ref>] </p>
      <p>Then the ratios of <emph>K</emph> to <emph>L</emph> and of <emph>L</emph> to <emph>M</emph> are the same <emph>BC</emph> to <emph>CG</emph> and of <emph>DC</emph> to <emph>CE</emph>. </p>
      <p>But the ratio of <emph>K</emph> to <emph>M</emph> is compounded of the ratio of <emph>K</emph> to <emph>L</emph> and of that of <emph>L</emph> to <emph>M</emph>; so that <emph>K</emph> has also to <emph>M</emph> the ratio compounded of the ratios </p>
      <p>Now since, as <emph>BC</emph> is to <emph>CG</emph>, so is the parallelogram <emph>AC</emph> to the parallelogram <emph>CH</emph>, [<ref target="elem.6.1" targOrder="U">VI. 1</ref>] while, as <emph>BC</emph> is to <emph>CG</emph>, so is <emph>K</emph> to <emph>L</emph>, therefore also, as <emph>K</emph> is to <emph>L</emph>, so is <emph>AC</emph> to <emph>CH</emph>. [<ref target="elem.5.11" targOrder="U">V. 11</ref>] </p>
      <p>Again, since, as <emph>DC</emph> is to <emph>CE</emph>, so is the parallelogram <emph>CH</emph> to <emph>CF</emph>, [<ref target="elem.6.1" targOrder="U">VI. 1</ref>] while, as <emph>DC</emph> is to <emph>CE</emph>, so is <emph>L</emph> to <emph>M</emph>, therefore also, as <emph>L</emph> is to <emph>M</emph>, so is the parallelogram <emph>CH</emph> to the parallelogram <emph>CF</emph>. [<ref target="elem.5.11" targOrder="U">V. 11</ref>] </p>
      <p>Since then it was proved that, as <emph>K</emph> is to <emph>L</emph>, so is the parallelogram <emph>AC</emph> to the parallelogram <emph>CH</emph>, and, as <emph>L</emph> is to <emph>M</emph>, so is the parallelogram <emph>CH</emph> to the parallelogram <emph>CF</emph>, therefore, <foreign lang="la">ex aequali</foreign>, as <emph>K</emph> is to <emph>M</emph>, so is <emph>AC</emph> to the parallelogram<emph>CF</emph>. </p>
      <p>But <emph>K</emph> has to <emph>M</emph> the ratio compounded of the ratios of the sides; <hi rend="center">therefore <emph>AC</emph> also has to <emph>CF</emph> the ratio compounded of the ratios of the sides.</hi>
       </p>
      <p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
