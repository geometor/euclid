      <head>PROPOSITION 26.</head>
      <p><emph>If from a parallelogram there be taken away a parallelogram similar and similarly situated to the whole and having a common angle with it</emph>, <emph>it is about the same diameter with the whole</emph>
      </p>
      <p>For from the parallelogram <emph>ABCD</emph> let there be taken away the parallelogram <emph>AF</emph> similar and similarly situated to <emph>ABCD</emph>, and having the angle <emph>DAB</emph> common with it; <emph>ABCD</emph> is about the same diameter with <emph>AF</emph>. </p>
      <p>For suppose it is not, but, if possible, let <emph>AHC</emph> be the diameter &lt; of <emph>ABCD</emph> &gt;, let <emph>GF</emph> be produced and carried through to <emph>H</emph>, and let <emph>HK</emph> be drawn through <emph>H</emph> parallel to either of the straight lines <emph>AD</emph>, <emph>BC</emph>. [<ref target="elem.1.31" targOrder="U">I. 31</ref>] </p>
      <p>Since, then, <emph>ABCD</emph> is about the same diameter with <emph>KG</emph>, therefore, as <emph>DA</emph> is to <emph>AB</emph>, so is <emph>GA</emph> to <emph>AK</emph>. [<ref target="elem.6.24" targOrder="U">VI. 24</ref>] </p>
      <p>But also, because of the similarity of <emph>ABCD</emph>, <emph>EG</emph>, <hi rend="center">as <emph>DA</emph> is to <emph>AB</emph>, so is <emph>GA</emph> to <emph>AE</emph>;</hi> therefore also, as <emph>GA</emph> is to <emph>AK</emph>, so is <emph>GA</emph> to <emph>AE</emph>. [<ref target="elem.5.11" targOrder="U">V. 11</ref>] </p>
      <p>Therefore <emph>GA</emph> has the same ratio to each of the straight lines <emph>AK</emph>, <emph>AE</emph>. </p>
      <p>Therefore <emph>AE</emph> is equal to <emph>AK</emph> [<ref target="elem.5.9" targOrder="U">V. 9</ref>], the less to the greater : which is impossible. </p>
      <p>Therefore <emph>ABCD</emph> cannot but be about the same diameter with <emph>AF</emph>; therefore the parallelogram <emph>ABCD</emph> is about the same diameter with the parallelogram <emph>AF</emph>. </p>
      <p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
