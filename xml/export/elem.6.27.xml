      <head>PROPOSITION 27.</head>
      <p><emph>Of all the parallelograms applied to the same straight line and deficient by parallelogrammic figures similar and similarly situated to that described on the half of the straight line</emph>, <emph>that parallelogram is greatest which is applied to the half of the straight line and is similar to the defect</emph>. </p>
      <p>Let <emph>AB</emph> be a straight line and let it be bisected at <emph>C</emph>; let there be applied to the straight line <emph>AB</emph> the parallelogram <emph>AD</emph> deficient by the parallelogrammic figure <emph>DB</emph> described on the half of <emph>AB</emph>, that is, <emph>CB</emph>; <emph>AB</emph> and deficient by parallelogrammic figures similar and similarly situated to <emph>DB</emph>, <emph>AD</emph> is greatest. </p>
      <p>For let there be applied to the straight line <emph>AB</emph> the parallelogram <emph>AF</emph> deficient by the parallelogrammic figure <emph>FB</emph> similar and similarly situated to <emph>DB</emph>; I say that <emph>AD</emph> is greater than <emph>AF</emph>. </p>
      <p>For, since the parallelogram <emph>DB</emph> is similar to the parallelogram <emph>FB</emph>, <hi rend="center">they are about the same diameter. [<ref target="elem.6.26" targOrder="U">VI. 26</ref>]</hi>
      </p>
      <p>Let their diameter <emph>DB</emph> be drawn, and let the figure be described. </p>
      <p>Then, since <emph>CF</emph> is equal to <emph>FE</emph>, [<ref target="elem.1.43" targOrder="U">I. 43</ref>] and <emph>FB</emph> is common, therefore the whole <emph>CH</emph> is equal to the whole <emph>KE</emph>. </p>
      <p>But <emph>CH</emph> is equal to <emph>CG</emph>, since <emph>AC</emph> is also equal to <emph>CB</emph>. [<ref target="elem.1.36" targOrder="U">I. 36</ref>] </p>
      <p>Therefore <emph>GC</emph> is also equal to <emph>EK</emph>. </p>
      <p>Let <emph>CF</emph> be added to each; <hi rend="center">therefore the whole <emph>AF</emph> is equal to the gnomon <emph>LMN</emph>;</hi> so that the parallelogram <emph>DB</emph>, that is, <emph>AD</emph>, is greater than the parallelogram <emph>AF</emph>. </p>
      <p>Therefore etc.</p>
