      <p><emph>If two triangles have one angle equal to one angle</emph>, <emph>the sides about other angles proportional</emph>, <emph>and the remaining angles either both less or both not less than a right angle</emph>, <emph>the triangles will be equiangular and will have those angles equal</emph>, <emph>the sides about which are proportional</emph>. </p>
      <p>Let <emph>ABC</emph>, <emph>DEF</emph> be two triangles having one angle equal to one angle, the angle <emph>BAC</emph> to the angle <emph>EDF</emph>, the sides about other angles <emph>ABC</emph>, <emph>DEF</emph> proportional, so that, as <emph>AB</emph> is to <emph>BC</emph>, so is <emph>DE</emph> to <emph>EF</emph>, and, first, each of the remaining angles at <emph>C</emph>, <emph>F</emph> less than a right angle; <emph>ABC</emph> is equiangular with the triangle <emph>DEF</emph>, the angle <emph>ABC</emph> will be equal to the angle <emph>DEF</emph>, and the remaining angle, namely the angle at <emph>C</emph>, equal to the remaining angle, the angle at <emph>F</emph>. </p>
      <p>For, if the angle <emph>ABC</emph> is unequal to the angle <emph>DEF</emph>, one of them is greater. </p>
      <p>Let the angle <emph>ABC</emph> be greater; and on the straight line <emph>AB</emph>, and at the point <emph>B</emph> on it, let the angle <emph>ABG</emph> be constructed equal to the angle <emph>DEF</emph>. [<ref target="elem.1.23" targOrder="U">I. 23</ref>] </p>
      <p>Then, since the angle <emph>A</emph> is equal to <emph>D</emph>, and the angle <emph>ABG</emph> to the angle <emph>DEF</emph>, therefore the remaining angle <emph>AGB</emph> is equal to the remaining angle <emph>DFE</emph>. [<ref target="elem.1.32" targOrder="U">I. 32</ref>] </p>
      <p>Therefore the triangle <emph>ABG</emph> is equiangular with the triangle <emph>DEF</emph>. </p>
      <p>Therefore, as <emph>AB</emph> is to <emph>BG</emph>, so is <emph>DE</emph> to <emph>EF</emph> [<ref target="elem.6.4" targOrder="U">VI. 4</ref>] </p>
      <p>But, as <emph>DE</emph> is to <emph>EF</emph>, so by hypothesis is <emph>AB</emph> to <emph>BC</emph>; therefore <emph>AB</emph> has the same ratio to each of the straight lines <emph>BC</emph>, <emph>BG</emph>; [<ref target="elem.5.11" targOrder="U">V. 11</ref>] <hi rend="center">therefore <emph>BC</emph> is equal to <emph>BG</emph>, [<ref target="elem.5.9" targOrder="U">V. 9</ref>]</hi> so that the angle at <emph>C</emph> is also equal to the angle <emph>BGC</emph>. [<ref target="elem.1.5" targOrder="U">I. 5</ref>] </p>
      <p>But, by hypothesis, the angle at <emph>C</emph> is less than a right angle; therefore the angle <emph>BGC</emph> is also less than a right angle; so that the angle <emph>AGB</emph> adjacent to it is greater than a right angle. [<ref target="elem.1.13" targOrder="U">I. 13</ref>] </p>
      <p>And it was proved equal to the angle at <emph>F</emph>; therefore the angle at <emph>F</emph> is also greater than a right angle. </p>
      <p>But it is by hypothesis less than a right angle : which is absurd. </p>
      <p>Therefore the angle <emph>ABC</emph> is not unequal to the angle <emph>DEF</emph>; therefore it is equal to it. </p>
      <p>But the angle at <emph>A</emph> is also equal to the angle at <emph>D</emph>; therefore the remaining angle at <emph>C</emph> is equal to the remaining angle at <emph>F</emph>. [<ref target="elem.1.32" targOrder="U">I. 32</ref>] </p>
      <p>Therefore the triangle <emph>ABC</emph> is equiangular with the triangle <emph>DEF</emph>. </p>
      <p>But, again, let each of the angles at <emph>C</emph>, <emph>F</emph> be supposed not less than a right angle; I say again that, in this case too, the triangle <emph>ABC</emph> is equiangular with the triangle <emph>DEF</emph>. </p>
      <p>For, with the same construction, we can prove similarly that <hi rend="center"><emph>BC</emph> is equal to <emph>BG</emph>;</hi> so that the angle at <emph>C</emph> is also equal to the angle <emph>BGC</emph>. [<ref target="elem.1.5" targOrder="U">I. 5</ref>] </p>
      <p>But the angle at <emph>C</emph> is not less than a right angle; therefore neither is the angle <emph>BGC</emph> less than a right angle. </p>
      <p>Thus in the triangle <emph>BGC</emph> the two angles are not less than two right angles: which is impossible. [<ref target="elem.1.17" targOrder="U">I. 17</ref>] </p>
      <p>Therefore, once more, the angle <emph>ABC</emph> is not unequal to the angle <emph>DEF</emph>; therefore it is equal to it. </p>
      <p>But the angle at <emph>A</emph> is also equal to the angle at <emph>D</emph>; therefore the remaining angle at <emph>C</emph> is equal to the remaining angle at <emph>F</emph>. [<ref target="elem.1.32" targOrder="U">I. 32</ref>] </p>
      <p>Therefore the triangle <emph>ABC</emph> is equiangular with the triangle <emph>DEF</emph>. </p>
      <p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
