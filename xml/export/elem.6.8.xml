      <p><emph>If in a right-angled triangle a perpendicular be drawn from the right angle to the base</emph>, <emph>the triangles adjoining the perpendicular are similar both to the whole and to one another</emph>. </p>
      <p>Let <emph>ABC</emph> be a right-angled triangle having the angle <emph>BAC</emph> right, and let <emph>AD</emph> be drawn from <emph>A</emph> perpendicular to <emph>BC</emph>; I say that each of the triangles <emph>ABD</emph>, <emph>ADC</emph> is similar to the whole <emph>ABC</emph> and, further, they are similar to one another. </p>
      <p>For, since the angle <emph>BAC</emph> is equal to the angle <emph>ADB</emph>, for each is right, and the angle at <emph>B</emph> is common to the two triangles <emph>ABC</emph> and <emph>ABD</emph>, therefore the remaining angle <emph>ACB</emph> is equal to the remaining angle <emph>BAD</emph>; [<ref target="elem.1.32" targOrder="U">I. 32</ref>] <emph>ABC</emph> is equiangular with the triangle <emph>ABD</emph>. </p>
      <p>Therefore, as <emph>BC</emph> which subtends the right angle in the triangle <emph>ABC</emph> is to <emph>BA</emph> which subtends the right angle in the triangle <emph>ABD</emph>, so is <emph>AB</emph> itself which subtends the angle at <emph>C</emph> in the triangle <emph>ABC</emph> to <emph>BD</emph> which subtends the equal angle <emph>BAD</emph> in the triangle <emph>ABD</emph>, and so also is <emph>AC</emph> to <emph>AD</emph> which subtends the angle at <emph>B</emph> common to the two triangles. [<ref target="elem.6.4" targOrder="U">VI. 4</ref>] </p>
      <p>Therefore the triangle <emph>ABC</emph> is both equiangular to the triangle <emph>ABD</emph> and has the sides about the equal angles proportional. </p>
      <p>Therefore the triangle <emph>ABC</emph> is similar to the triangle <emph>ABD</emph>. [<ref target="elem.6.def.1" targOrder="U">VI. Def. 1</ref>] </p>
      <p>Similarly we can prove that the triangle <emph>ABC</emph> is also similar to the triangle <emph>ADC</emph>; therefore each of the triangles <emph>ABD</emph>, <emph>ADC</emph> is similar to the whole <emph>ABC</emph>. </p>
      <p>I say next that the triangles <emph>ABD</emph>, <emph>ADC</emph> are also similar to one another. </p>
      <p>For, since the right angle <emph>BDA</emph> is equal to the right angle <emph>ADC</emph>, and moreover the angle <emph>BAD</emph> was also proved equal to the angle at <emph>C</emph>, therefore the remaining angle at <emph>B</emph> is also equal to the remaining angle <emph>DAC</emph>; [<ref target="elem.1.32" targOrder="U">I. 32</ref>] therefore the triangle <emph>ABD</emph> is equiangular with the triangle <emph>ADC</emph>. </p>
      <p>Therefore, as <emph>BD</emph> which subtends the angle <emph>BAD</emph> in the triangle <emph>ABD</emph> is to <emph>DA</emph> which subtends the angle at <emph>C</emph> in the triangle <emph>ADC</emph> equal to the angle <emph>BAD</emph>, so is <emph>AD</emph> itself which subtends the angle at <emph>B</emph> in the triangle <emph>ABD</emph> to <emph>DC</emph> which subtends the angle <emph>DAC</emph> in the triangle <emph>ADC</emph> equal <emph>B</emph>, and so also is <emph>BA</emph> to <emph>AC</emph>, these sides subtending the right angles; [<ref target="elem.6.4" targOrder="U">VI. 4</ref>] therefore the triangle <emph>ABD</emph> is similar to the triangle <emph>ADC</emph>. [<ref target="elem.6.def.1" targOrder="U">VI. Def. 1</ref>] </p>
      <p>Therefore etc. </p>

       <p>From this it is clear that, if in a right-angled triangle a perpendicular be drawn from the right angle to the base, the straight line so drawn is a mean proportional between the segments of the base. Q. E. D.</p>
