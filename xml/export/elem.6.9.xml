      <p><emph>From a given straight line to cut off a prescribed part</emph>. </p>
      <p>Let <emph>AB</emph> be the given straight line; thus it is required to cut off from <emph>AB</emph> a prescribed part. </p>
      <p>Let the third part be that prescribed. </p>
      <p>Let a straight line <emph>AC</emph> be drawn through from <emph>A</emph> containing with <emph>AB</emph> any angle; let a point <emph>D</emph> be taken at random on <emph>AC</emph>, and let <emph>DE</emph>, <emph>EC</emph> be made equal to <emph>AD</emph>. [<ref target="elem.1.3" targOrder="U">I. 3</ref>] </p>
      <p>Let <emph>BC</emph> be joined, and through <emph>D</emph> let <emph>DF</emph> be drawn parallel to it. [<ref target="elem.1.31" targOrder="U">I. 31</ref>] </p>
      <p>Then, since <emph>FD</emph> has been drawn parallel to <emph>BC</emph>, one of the sides of the triangle <emph>ABC</emph>, therefore, proportionally, as <emph>CD</emph> is to <emph>DA</emph>, so is <emph>BF</emph> to <emph>FA</emph>. [<ref target="elem.6.2" targOrder="U">VI. 2</ref>] </p>
      <p>But <emph>CD</emph> is double of <emph>DA</emph>; <hi rend="center">therefore <emph>BF</emph> is also double of <emph>FA</emph>; therefore <emph>BA</emph> is triple of <emph>AF</emph>.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>Therefore from the given straight line <emph>AB</emph> the prescribed third part <emph>AF</emph> has been cut off. Q. E. F.
<note n="6" type="crit" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">
        <p><hi rend="bold">any angle</hi>. The expression here and in the two following propositions is <foreign lang="greek">τυχοῦσα γωνία</foreign>, corresponding exactly to <foreign lang="greek">τυχὸν σημεῖον</foreign> which I have translated as <quote>a point (taken) <emph>at random</emph></quote>
; but <quote>an angle (taken) at random</quote>
 would not be so appropriate where it is a question, not of <emph>taking</emph> any angle at all, but of drawing a straight line casually so as to make any angle with another straight line.</p>
