       <hi rend="ital">The least numbers of those which have the same ratio with them are prime to one another.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>Let <hi rend="ital">A</hi>, <hi rend="ital">B</hi> be the least numbers of those which have the same ratio with them; I say that <hi rend="ital">A</hi>, <hi rend="ital">B</hi> are prime to one another. </p>
      <p>For, if they are not prime to one another, some number will measure them. </p>
      <p>Let some number measure them, and let it be <hi rend="ital">C</hi>. </p>
      <p>And, as many times as <hi rend="ital">C</hi> measures <hi rend="ital">A</hi>, so many units let there be in <hi rend="ital">D</hi>, and, as many times as <hi rend="ital">C</hi> measures <hi rend="ital">B</hi>, so many units let there be in <hi rend="ital">E</hi>
      </p>
      <p>Since <hi rend="ital">C</hi> measures <hi rend="ital">A</hi> according to the units in <hi rend="ital">D</hi>, therefore <hi rend="ital">C</hi> by multiplying <hi rend="ital">D</hi> has made <hi rend="ital">A</hi>. [<ref target="elem.7.def.15" targOrder="U">VII. Def. 15</ref>] </p>
      <p>For the same reason also <hi rend="ital">C</hi> by multiplying <hi rend="ital">E</hi> has made <hi rend="ital">B</hi>. </p>
      <p>Thus the number <hi rend="ital">C</hi> by multiplying the two numbers <hi rend="ital">D</hi>, <hi rend="ital">E</hi> has made <hi rend="ital">A</hi>, <hi rend="ital">B</hi>; therefore, as <hi rend="ital">D</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">E</hi>, so is <hi rend="ital">A</hi> to <hi rend="ital">B</hi>; [<ref target="elem.7.17" targOrder="U">VII. 17</ref>] therefore <hi rend="ital">D</hi>, <hi rend="ital">E</hi> are in the same ratio with <hi rend="ital">A</hi>, <hi rend="ital">B</hi>, being less than they: which is impossible. </p>
      <p>Therefore no number will measure the numbers <hi rend="ital">A</hi>, <hi rend="ital">B</hi>. </p>
      <p>Therefore <hi rend="ital">A</hi>, <hi rend="ital">B</hi> are prime to one another. Q. E. D.</p>
