       <hi rend="ital">Any composite number is measured by some prime number.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>Let <hi rend="ital">A</hi> be a composite number; I say that <hi rend="ital">A</hi> is measured by some prime number. </p>
      <p>For, since <hi rend="ital">A</hi> is composite, </p>
      <p>Let a number measure it, and let it be <hi rend="ital">B</hi>. </p>
      <p>Now, if <hi rend="ital">B</hi> is prime, what was enjoined will have been done. </p>
      <p>But if it is composite, some number will measure it. </p>
      <p>Let a number measure it, and let it be <hi rend="ital">C</hi>. </p>
      <p>Then, since <hi rend="ital">C</hi> measures <hi rend="ital">B</hi>, and <hi rend="ital">B</hi> measures <hi rend="ital">A</hi>, therefore <hi rend="ital">C</hi> also measures <hi rend="ital">A</hi>. </p>
      <p>And, if <hi rend="ital">C</hi> is prime, what was enjoined will have been done. </p>
      <p>But if it is composite, some number will measure it. </p>
      <p>Thus, if the investigation be continued in this way, some prime number will be found which will measure the number <hi rend="ital">A</hi>. </p>
      <p>For, if it is not found, an infinite series of numbers will measure the number <hi rend="ital">A</hi>, each of which is less than the other: which is impossible in numbers. </p>
      <p>Therefore some prime number will be found which will <hi rend="ital">A</hi>. </p>
      <p>Therefore any composite number is measured by some prime number.<note n="8. if B is prime, what was enjoined will have been done," type="crit" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">i.e. the implied <hi rend="ital">problem</hi> of finding a prime number which measures <hi rend="ital">A</hi>.</note>
