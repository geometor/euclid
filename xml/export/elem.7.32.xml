       <hi rend="ital">Any number either is prime or is measured by some prime number.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>Let <hi rend="ital">A</hi> be a number; I say that <hi rend="ital">A</hi> either is prime or is measured by some prime number. </p>
      <p>If now <hi rend="ital">A</hi> is prime, that which was enjoined will have been done. </p>
      <p>But if it is composite, some prime number will measure it. [<ref target="elem.7.31" targOrder="U">VII. 31</ref>] </p>
      <p>Therefore any number either is prime or is measured by some prime number. Q. E. D.</p>
