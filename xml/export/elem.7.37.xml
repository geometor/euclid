       <hi rend="ital">If a number be measured by any number, the number which is measured will have a part called by the same name as the measuring number.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>For let the number <hi rend="ital">A</hi> be measured by any number <hi rend="ital">B</hi>; I say that <hi rend="ital">A</hi> has a part called by the same name as <hi rend="ital">B</hi>. </p>
      <p>For, as many times as <hi rend="ital">B</hi> measures <hi rend="ital">A</hi>, so many units let there be in <hi rend="ital">C</hi>. </p>
      <p>Since <hi rend="ital">B</hi> measures <hi rend="ital">A</hi> according to the units in <hi rend="ital">C</hi>, and the unit <hi rend="ital">D</hi> also measures the number <hi rend="ital">C</hi> according to the units in it, <hi rend="ital">D</hi> measures the number <hi rend="ital">C</hi> the same number of times as <hi rend="ital">B</hi> measures <hi rend="ital">A</hi>. </p>
      <p>Therefore, alternately, the unit <hi rend="ital">D</hi> measures the number <hi rend="ital">B</hi> the same number of times as <hi rend="ital">C</hi> measures <hi rend="ital">A</hi>; [<ref target="elem.7.15" targOrder="U">VII. 15</ref>] therefore, whatever part the unit <hi rend="ital">D</hi> is of the number <hi rend="ital">B</hi>, the same part is <hi rend="ital">C</hi> of <hi rend="ital">A</hi> also. </p>
      <p>But the unit <hi rend="ital">D</hi> is a part of the number <hi rend="ital">B</hi> called by the same name as it; therefore <hi rend="ital">C</hi> is also a part of <hi rend="ital">A</hi> called by the same name as <hi rend="ital">B</hi>, so that <hi rend="ital">A</hi> has a part <hi rend="ital">C</hi> which is called by the same name as <hi rend="ital">B</hi>.
