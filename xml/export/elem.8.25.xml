       <hi rend="ital">If two numbers have to one another the ratio which a cube number has to a cube number, and the first be cube, the second will also be cube.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>For let the two numbers <hi rend="ital">A</hi>, <hi rend="ital">B</hi> have to one another the ratio which the cube number <hi rend="ital">C</hi> has to the cube number <hi rend="ital">D</hi>, and let <hi rend="ital">A</hi> be cube; I say that <hi rend="ital">B</hi> is also cube. </p>
      <p>For, since <hi rend="ital">C</hi>, <hi rend="ital">D</hi> are cube, <hi rend="ital">C</hi>, <hi rend="ital">D</hi> are similar solid numbers. </p>
      <p>Therefore two mean proportional numbers fall between <hi rend="ital">C</hi>, <hi rend="ital">D</hi>. [<ref target="elem.8.19" targOrder="U">VIII. 19</ref>] </p>
      <p>And, as many numbers as fall between <hi rend="ital">C</hi>, <hi rend="ital">D</hi> in continued proportion, so many will also fall between those which have the same ratio with them; [<ref target="elem.8.8" targOrder="U">VIII. 8</ref>] so that two mean proportional numbers fall between <hi rend="ital">A</hi>, <hi rend="ital">B</hi> also. </p>
      <p>Let <hi rend="ital">E</hi>, <hi rend="ital">F</hi> so fall. </p>
      <p>Since, then, the four numbers <hi rend="ital">A</hi>, <hi rend="ital">E</hi>, <hi rend="ital">F</hi>, <hi rend="ital">B</hi> are in continued proportion, and <hi rend="ital">A</hi> is cube, therefore <hi rend="ital">B</hi> is also cube.
