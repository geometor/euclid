       <hi rend="ital">If two similar plane numbers by multiplying one another make some number, the product will be square.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>Let <hi rend="ital">A</hi>, <hi rend="ital">B</hi> be two similar plane numbers, and let <hi rend="ital">A</hi> by multiplying <hi rend="ital">B</hi> make <hi rend="ital">C</hi>; I say that <hi rend="ital">C</hi> is square. </p>
      <p>For let <hi rend="ital">A</hi> by multiplying itself make <hi rend="ital">D</hi>. </p>
      <p>Therefore <hi rend="ital">D</hi> is square. </p>
      <p>Since then <hi rend="ital">A</hi> by multiplying itself has made <hi rend="ital">D</hi>, and by multiplying <hi rend="ital">B</hi> has made <hi rend="ital">C</hi>, therefore, as <hi rend="ital">A</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">B</hi>, so is <hi rend="ital">D</hi> to <hi rend="ital">C</hi>. [<ref target="elem.7.17" targOrder="U">VII. 17</ref>] </p>
      <p>And, since <hi rend="ital">A</hi>, <hi rend="ital">B</hi> are similar plane numbers, therefore one mean proportional number falls between <hi rend="ital">A</hi>, <hi rend="ital">B</hi>. [<ref target="elem.8.18" targOrder="U">VIII. 18</ref>] </p>
      <p>But, if numbers fall between two numbers in continued proportion, as many as fall between them, so many also fall between those which have the same ratio; [<ref target="elem.8.8" targOrder="U">VIII. 8</ref>] so that one mean proportional number falls between <hi rend="ital">D</hi>, <hi rend="ital">C</hi> also. </p>
      <p>And <hi rend="ital">D</hi> is square; therefore <hi rend="ital">C</hi> is also square. [<ref target="elem.8.22" targOrder="U">VIII. 22</ref>] Q. E. D.</p>
