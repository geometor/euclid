       <hi rend="ital">If as many odd numbers as we please be added together, and their multitude be even, the whole will be even.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>For let as many odd numbers as we please, <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">BC</hi>, <hi rend="ital">CD</hi>, <hi rend="ital">DE</hi>, even in multitude, be added together; I say that the whole <hi rend="ital">AE</hi> is even. </p>
      <p>For, since each of the numbers <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">BC</hi>, <hi rend="ital">CD</hi>, <hi rend="ital">DE</hi> is odd, if an unit be subtracted from each, each of the remainders will be even; [<ref target="elem.7.def.7" targOrder="U">VII. Def. 7</ref>] so that the sum of them will be even. [<ref target="elem.9.21" targOrder="U">IX. 21</ref>] </p>
      <p>But the multitude of the units is also even. </p>
      <p>Therefore the whole <hi rend="ital">AE</hi> is also even. [<ref target="elem.9.21" targOrder="U">IX. 21</ref>] Q. E. D.</p>
