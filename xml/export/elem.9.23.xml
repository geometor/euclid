       <hi rend="ital">If as many odd numbers as we please be added together, and their multitude be odd, the whole will also be odd.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>For let as many odd numbers as we please, <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">BC</hi>, <hi rend="ital">CD</hi>, the multitude of which is odd, be added together; I say that the whole <hi rend="ital">AD</hi> is also odd. </p>
      <p>Let the unit <hi rend="ital">DE</hi> be subtracted from <hi rend="ital">CD</hi>; therefore the remainder <hi rend="ital">CE</hi> is even. [<ref target="elem.7.def.7" targOrder="U">VII. Def. 7</ref>] </p>
      <p>But <hi rend="ital">CA</hi> is also even; [<ref target="elem.9.22" targOrder="U">IX. 22</ref>] therefore the whole <hi rend="ital">AE</hi> is also even. [<ref target="elem.9.21" targOrder="U">IX. 21</ref>] </p>
      <p>And <hi rend="ital">DE</hi> is an unit. </p>
      <p>Therefore <hi rend="ital">AD</hi> is odd. [<ref target="elem.7.def.7" targOrder="U">VII. Def. 7</ref>] Q. E. D.

 This form, natural in Greek, is awkward in English.</note></p>
