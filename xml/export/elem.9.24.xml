       <hi rend="ital">If from an even number an even number be subtracted, the remainder will be even.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>For from the even number <hi rend="ital">AB</hi> let the even number <hi rend="ital">BC</hi> be subtracted: I say that the remainder <hi rend="ital">CA</hi> is even. </p>
      <p>For, since <hi rend="ital">AB</hi> is even, it has a half part. [<ref target="elem.7.def.6" targOrder="U">VII. Def. 6</ref>] </p>
      <p>For the same reason <hi rend="ital">BC</hi> also has a half part; so that the remainder [<hi rend="ital">CA</hi> also has a half part, and] <hi rend="ital">AC</hi> is therefore even. Q. E. D.</p>
