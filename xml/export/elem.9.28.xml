       <hi rend="ital">If an odd number by multiplying an even number make some number, the product will be even.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>For let the odd number <hi rend="ital">A</hi> by multiplying the even number <hi rend="ital">B</hi> make <hi rend="ital">C</hi>; I say that <hi rend="ital">C</hi> is even. </p>
      <p>For, since <hi rend="ital">A</hi> by multiplying <hi rend="ital">B</hi> has made <hi rend="ital">C</hi>, therefore <hi rend="ital">C</hi> is made up of as many numbers equal to <hi rend="ital">B</hi> as there are units in <hi rend="ital">A</hi>. [<ref target="elem.7.def.15" targOrder="U">VII. Def. 15</ref>] </p>
      <p>And <hi rend="ital">B</hi> is even; therefore <hi rend="ital">C</hi> is made up of even numbers. </p>
      <p>But, if as many even numbers as we please be added together, the whole is even. [<ref target="elem.9.21" targOrder="U">IX. 21</ref>] </p>
      <p>Therefore <hi rend="ital">C</hi> is even. Q. E. D.</p>
