       <hi rend="ital">Each of the numbers which are continually doubled beginning from a dyad is even-times even only.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>For let as many numbers as we please, <hi rend="ital">B</hi>, <hi rend="ital">C</hi>, <hi rend="ital">D</hi>, have been continually doubled beginning from the dyad <hi rend="ital">A</hi>; I say that <hi rend="ital">B</hi>, <hi rend="ital">C</hi>, <hi rend="ital">D</hi> are eventimes even only. </p>
      <p>Now that each of the numbers <hi rend="ital">B</hi>, <hi rend="ital">C</hi>, <hi rend="ital">D</hi> is even-times even is manifest; for it is doubled from a dyad. </p>
      <p>I say that it is also even-times even only. </p>
      <p>For let an unit be set out. </p>
      <p>Since then as many numbers as we please beginning from an unit are in continued proportion, and the number <hi rend="ital">A</hi> after the unit is prime, therefore <hi rend="ital">D</hi>, the greatest of the numbers <hi rend="ital">A</hi>, <hi rend="ital">B</hi>, <hi rend="ital">C</hi>, <hi rend="ital">D</hi>, will not be measured by any other number except <hi rend="ital">A</hi>, <hi rend="ital">B</hi>, <hi rend="ital">C</hi>. [<ref target="elem.9.13" targOrder="U">IX. 13</ref>] </p>
      <p>And each of the numbers <hi rend="ital">A</hi>, <hi rend="ital">B</hi>, <hi rend="ital">C</hi> is even; therefore <hi rend="ital">D</hi> is even-times even only. [<ref target="elem.7.def.8" targOrder="U">VII. Def. 8</ref>] </p>
      <p>Similarly we can prove that each of the numbers <hi rend="ital">B</hi>, <hi rend="ital">C</hi> is even-times even only. Q. E. D.</p>
