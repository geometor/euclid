[elem.1.post.1]
- Now, since the point `A` is the centre of the circle `CDB`, > `AC` is equal to `AB`. [elem.1.def.15]
- Again, since the point `B` is the centre of the circle `CAE`, > `BC` is equal to `BA`. [elem.1.def.15]

To place at a given point (as an extremity) a straight line equal to a given straight line.

- Let `A` be the given point, and `BC` the given straight line.

- From the point `A` to the point `B` let the straight line `AB` be joined; [elem.1.post.1] and on it let the equilateral triangle `DAB` be constructed. [elem.1.1]
- Let the straight lines `AE`, `BF` be produced in a straight line with `DA`, `DB`; [elem.1.post.2] with centre `B` and distance `BC` let the `CGH` be described; [elem.1.post.3] and again, with centre `D` and distance `DG` let the circle `GKL` be described. [elem.1.post.3]

- For, if the triangle `ABC` be applied to the triangle `DEF`, > and if the point `A` be placed `D` and the straight line `AB` on `DE`, then the point `B` will also coincide with `E`, because `AB` is equal to `DE`.
- Again, `AB` coinciding with `DE`, the straight line `AC` will also coincide with `DF`, because the angle `BAC` is equal to the angle `EDF`; > hence the point `C` will also coincide with the point `F`, because `AC` is again equal to `DF`.
- But `B` also coincided with `E`; hence the base `BC` will coincide with the base `EF`.
- [For if, when `B` coincides with `E` and `C` with `F`, the base `BC` does not coincide with the base `EF`, two straight lines will enclose a space: which is impossible. > Therefore the base `BC` will coincide with `EF`] and will be equal to it. [elem.1.c.n.4]

In isosceles triangles the angles at the base are equal to one another, and, if the equal straight lines be produced further, the angles under the base will be equal to one another.

- Let `ABC` be an isosceles triangle having the side `AB`

- Then, since `AF` is equal to `AG` and `AB` to `AC`, > the two sides `FA`, `AC` are equal to the two sides `GA`, `AB`, respectively; and they contain a common angle, the angle `FAG`. > Therefore the base `FC` is equal to the base `GB`, and the triangle `AFC` is equal to the triangle `AGB`, and the remaining angles will be equal to the remaining angles respectively, namely those which the equal sides subtend, > that is, the angle `ACF` to the angle `ABG`, `AFC` to the angle `AGB`. [elem.1.4]
- And, since the whole `AF` is equal to the whole `AG`, > and in these `AB` is equal to `AC`, the remainder `BF` is equal to the remainder `CG`.
- But `FC` was also proved equal to `GB`; `BF`, `FC` are equal to the two sides `CG`, `GB` respectively; and the angle `BFC` is equal to the angle `CGB`, > while the base `BC` is common to them; therefore the triangle `BFC` is also equal to the triangle `CGB`, > therefore the angle `FBC` is equal to the angle `GCB`, and the angle `BCF` to the angle `CBG`.
- Accordingly, since the whole angle `ABG` was proved equal to the angle `ACF`, > and in these the angle `CBG` is equal to the angle `BCF`, the remaining angle `ABC` is equal to the remaining angle `ACB`; > and they are at the base of the triangle `ABC`. But the angle `FBC` was also proved equal to the angle `GCB`; > and they are under the base.

# elem.1.6

If in a triangle two angles be equal to one another, the sides which subtend the equal angles will also be equal to one another.

- Let `ABC` be a triangle having the angle `ABC` equal to the angle `ACB`;
- I say that the side `AB` is also equal to the side `AC`.
- For, if `AB` is unequal to `AC`, one of them is greater.
- Let `AB` be greater; and from `AB` the greater let `DB` be cut off equal to `AC` the less;
- let `DC` be joined.
- Then, since `DB` is equal to `AC`, and `BC` is common, > the two sides `DB`, `BC` are equal to the two sides `AC`, `CB` respectively;
        `DBC` is equal to the angle `ACB`; > therefore the base `DC` is equal to the base `AB`, and the triangle `DBC` will be equal to the triangle `ACB`, the less to the greater: which is absurd. Therefore `AB` is not unequal to `AC`; it is therefore equal to it.
- Therefore etc.


# elem.1.7

Given two straight lines constructed on a straight line (from its extremities) and meeting in a point, there cannot be constructed on the same straight line (from its extremities), and on the same side of it, two other straight lines meeting in

- Then, since `AC` is equal to `AD`, > the angle `ACD` is also equal to the angle `ADC`; [elem.1.5] `ADC` is greater than the angle `DCB`; therefore the angle `CDB` is much greater than the angle `DCB`.
- Again, since `CB` is equal to `DB`, > the angle `CDB` is also equal to the angle `DCB`.
        > which is impossible.
- Therefore etc.


# elem.1.8

If two triangles have the two sides equal to two sides respectively, and have also the base equal to the base, they will also have the angles equal which are contained by the equal straight lines.

- Let `ABC`, `DEF` be two triangles having the two sides `AB`, `AC` equal to the two sides `DE`, `DF` respectively, namely `AB` to `DE`, and `AC` to `DF`; and let them have the base `BC` equal `EF`;
- I say that the angle `BAC` is also equal to the angle `EDF`.
- For, if the triangle `ABC` be applied to the triangle `DEF`, and if the point `B` be placed on `E` and the straight line `BC` on `EF`, > the point `C` will also coincide with `F`, because `BC` is equal to `EF`.
- Then, `BC` coinciding with `EF`, > `BA`, `AC` will also coincide with `ED`, `DF`;
        `BC` coincides with the base `EF`, and the sides `BA`, `AC` do not coincide with `ED`, `DF` but fall beside them as `EG`, `GF`, > then, given two straight lines constructed on a straight line (from its extremities) and meeting in a point, there will elem.1.7]
- Therefore it is not possible that, if the base `BC` be applied to the base `EF`, the sides `BA`, `AC` should not coincide with `ED`, `DF`; > they will therefore coincide,
        `BAC` will also coincide with the angle `EDF`, and will be equal to it.
- If therefore etc.


# elem.1.9

To bisect a given rectilineal angle.

- Let the angle `BAC` be the given rectilineal angle.
- Thus it is required to bisect it.
- Let a point `D` be taken at random on `AB`; let `AE` be cut off from `AC` equal to `AD`; [elem.1.3] let `DE` be joined, and on `DE` let the equilateral triangle `DEF` be constructed; let `AF` be joined.
- I say that the angle `BAC` has been bisected by the straight line `AF`.
- For, since `AD` is equal to `AE`, and `AF` is common, > the two sides `DA`, `AF` are equal to the two sides `EA`, `AF` respectively.
- And the base `DF` is equal to the base `EF`; > therefore the angle `DAF` is equal to the angle `EAF`. [elem.1.8]
- Therefore the given rectilineal angle `BAC` has been bisected by the straight line `AF`.


# elem.1.10

To bisect a given finite straight line.

- Let `AB` be the given finite straight line.
- Thus it is required to bisect the finite straight line `AB`.
- Let the equilateral triangle `ABC` be constructed on it, [elem.1.1] and let the angle `ACB` be bisected by the straight line `CD`; [elem.1.9]
- I say that the straight line `AB` has been bisected at the point `D`.
- For, since `AC` is equal to `CB`, and `CD` is common, > the two sides `AC`, `CD` are equal to the two sides `BC`, `CD` respectively; and the angle `ACD` is equal to the angle `BCD`; > therefore the base `AD` is equal to the base `BD`. [elem.1.4]
- Therefore the given finite straight line `AB` has been bisected at `D`.


# elem.1.11

To draw a straight line at right angles to a given straight line from a given point on it.

- Let `AB` be the given straight line, and `C` the given point on it.
- Thus it is required to draw from the point `C` a straight line at right angles to the straight line `AB`.
- Let a point `D` be taken at random on `AC`; `CE` be made equal to `CD`; [elem.1.3] on `DE` let the equilateral triangle `FDE` be constructed, [elem.1.1] and let `FC` be joined;
- I say that the straight line `FC` has been drawn at right `AB` from `C` the given point on it.
- For, since `DC` is equal to `CE`, and `CF` is common, > the two sides `DC`, `CF` are equal to the two sides `EC`, `CF` respectively; and the base `DF` is equal to the base `FE`; > therefore the angle `DCF` is equal to the angle `ECF`; [elem.1.8] and they are adjacent angles.
- But, when a straight line set up on a straight line makes elem.1.def.10] > therefore each of the angles `DCF`, `FCE` is right.

To a given infinite straight line, from a given point which is not on it, to draw a perpendicular straight line.

- Let `AB` be the given infinite straight line, and `C` the given point which is not on it; `AB`, from the given point `C` which is not on it, a perpendicular straight line.
- For let a point `D` be taken `AB`, and with centre `C` and distance `CD` let the circle `EFG` be described; [elem.1.post.3] > let the straight line `EG`

- I say that `CH` has been drawn perpendicular to the given infinite straight line `AB` from the given point `C` which is not on it.
- For, since `GH` is equal to `HE`, and `HC` is common, > the two sides `GH`, `HC` are equal to the two sides `EH`, `HC` respectively; and the base `CG` is equal to the base `CE`; > therefore the angle `CHG` is equal to the angle `EHC`. [elem.1.8] And they are adjacent angles.

If a straight line set up on a straight line make angles, it will make either two right angles or angles equal to two right angles.

- I say that the angles `CBA`, `ABD` are either two right angles or equal to two right angles.
- Now, if the angle `CBA` is equal to `ABD`, > they are two right angles. [elem.1.def.10]
- But, if not, let `BE` be drawn from the point `B` at right angles to `CD`; [elem.1.11] > therefore the angles `CBE`, `EBD` are two right angles.
- Then, since the angle `CBE` is equal to the two angles `CBA`, `ABE`, > let the angle `EBD` be added to each; therefore the angles `CBE`, `EBD` are equal to the three angles `CBA`, `ABE`, `EBD`. [. 2]
- Again, since the angle `DBA` is equal to the two angles `DBE`, `EBA`, > let the angle `ABC` be added to each; therefore the angles `DBA`. `ABC` are equal to the three angles `DBE`, `EBA`, `ABC`. [. 2]
- But the angles `CBE`, `EBD` were also proved equal to the same three angles; > and things which are equal to the same thing are also equal to one another; [. 1] therefore the angles `CBE`, `EBD` are also equal to the `DBA`, `ABC`.
        `CBE`, `EBD` are two right angles; > therefore the angles `DBA`, `ABC` are also equal to two right angles.

# elem.1.14

If with any straight line, and at a point on it, two straight lines not lying on the same side make the adjacent angles equal to two right angles, the two straight lines will be in a straight line with one another.

- For with any straight line `AB`, and at the point `B` on it, let the two straight lines `BC`, `BD` not lying on the same side make the adjacent angles `ABC`, `ABD` equal to two right angles;
- I say that `BD` is in a straight line with `CB`.
- For, if `BD` is not in a straight line with `BC`, let `BE` be in a straight line with `CB`.
- Then, since the straight line `AB` stands on the straight line `CBE`, > the angles `ABC`, `ABE` are equal to two right angles.

- Let the angle `CBA` be subtracted from each; `ABE` is equal to the remaining angle `ABD`, [elem.1.c.n.3] > the less to the greater: which is impossible. Therefore `BE` is not in a straight line with `CB`.

- For, since the straight line `AE` stands `CD`, making the angles `CEA`, `AED`, > the angles `CEA`, `AED` are equal to two right angles [elem.1.13]

[elem.1.15] `AB` is equal to the base `FC`, and the triangle `ABE` is equal to the triangle `CFE`, and the remaining angles are equal to the remaining angles respectively, namely those which the equal sides subtend; [elem.1.4] therefore the angle `BAE` is equal to the angle `ECF`.
- But the angle `ECD` is greater than the angle `ECF`; [. 5] > therefore the angle `ACD` is greater than the angle `BAE`.

- I say that the angle `ABC` is also greater than the angle `BCA`.
- For, since `AC` is greater than `AB`, let `AD` be made equal to `AB` [elem.1.3], and let `BD` bejoined.
- Then, since the angle `ADB` is an exterior angle of the triangle `BCD`,
- it is greater than the interior and opposite angle `DCB`. [elem.1.16]
- But the angle `ADB` is equal to the angle `ABD`, > since the side `AB` is equal to `AD`; therefore the angle `ABD` is also greater than the angle `ACB`; therefore the angle `ABC` is much greater than the angle `ACB`.

In any triangle the greater angle is subtended by the greater side.

- Let `ABC` be a triangle having the angle `ABC` greater than the angle `BCA`;

- For let `BA` be drawn through to the point `D`, let `DA` be made equal to `CA`, and let `DC` be joined.
- Then, since `DA` is equal to `AC`, the angle `ADC` is also equal to the angle `ACD`; [elem.1.5] > therefore the angle `BCD` is greater than the angle `ADC`. [elem.1.c.n.5]

- On `BC`, one of the sides of the triangle `ABC`, from its extremities `B`, `C`, let the two straight lines `BD`, `DC` be constructed meeting within the triangle;
- I say that `BD`, `DC` are less than the remaining two sides `BA`, `AC`, but contain an angle `BDC` greater than the angle `BAC`.
- For let `BD` be drawn through to `E`.
- Then, since in any triangle two sides are greater than the remaining elem.1.20] > therefore, in the triangle `ABE`, the two sides `AB`, `AE` are greater than `BE`.
- Let `EC` be added to each; > therefore `BA`, `AC` are greater than `BE`, `EC`.
- Again, since, in the triangle `CED`, > the two sides `CE`, `ED` are greater than `CD`, let `DB` be added to each; therefore `CE`, `EB` are greater than `CD`, `DB`.
- But `BA`, `AC` were proved greater than `BE`, `EC`; > therefore `BA`, `AC` are much greater than `BD`, `DC`.
- Again, since in any triangle the exterior angle is greater than the interior and opposite angle, [elem.1.16] therefore, in the triangle `CDE`, > the exterior angle `BDC` is greater than the angle `CED`.
- For the same reason, moreover, in the triangle `ABE` also, > the exterior angle `CEB` is greater than the angle `BAC`. But the angle `BDC` was proved greater than the angle `CEB`; > therefore the angle `BDC` is much greater than the angle `BAC`.

# elem.1.22

Out of three straight lines, which are equal to three given straight lines, to construct a triangle: thus it is necessary that two of the straight lines taken together in any manner should be greater than the remaining one. [elem.1.20]

- Let the three given straight lines be `A`, `B`, `C`, and of these let two taken together in any manner be greater than the remaining one, namely `A`, `B` greater than `C`, > `A`, `C` greater than `B`, and `B`, `C` greater than `A`; thus it is required to construct a triangle out of straight lines equal to `A`, `B`, `C`.
- Let there be set out a straight line `DE`, terminated at `D` but of infinite length in the direction of `E`, and let `DF` be made equal to `A`, `FG` equal to `B`, and `GH` equal to `C`. [elem.1.3]
- With centre `F` and distance `FD` let the circle `DKL` be described; again, with centre `G` and distance `GH` let the circle `KLH` be described; and let `KF`, `KG` be joined;
- I say that the triangle `KFG` has been constructed out of three straight lines equal to `A`, `B`, `C`.
- For, since the point `F` is the centre of the circle `DKL`, > `FD` is equal to `FK`.
- But `FD` is equal to `A`; > therefore `KF` is also equal to `A`.
- Again, since the point `G` is the centre of the circle `LKH`, > `GH` is equal to `GK`.
- But `GH` is equal to `C`; > therefore `KG` is also equal to `C`. And `FG` is also equal to `B`; therefore the three straight lines `KF`, `FG`, `GK` are equal to the three straight lines `A`, `B`, `C`.

- Let `AB` be the given straight line, `A` the point on it, and the angle `DCE` the given rectilineal angle;
- thus it is required to construct on the given straight line `AB`, and at the point `A` on it, a rectilineal angle equal to the given rectilineal angle `DCE`.
- On the straight lines `CD`, `CE` respectively let the points `D`, `E` be taken at random; let `DE` be joined, and out of three straight lines which are equal to the three `CD`, `DE`, `CE` let the triangle `AFG` be constructed in such a way that `CD` is equal to `AF`, `CE` to `AG`, and further `DE` to `FG`.
- Then, since the two sides `DC`, `CE` are equal to the two sides `FA`, `AG` respectively, > and the base `DE` is equal to the base `FG`, the angle `DCE` is equal to the angle `FAG`. [elem.1.8]
- Therefore on the given straight line `AB`, and at the point `A` on it, the rectilineal angle `FAG` has been constructed equal to the given rectilineal angle `DCE`.


# elem.1.24

If two triangles have the two sides equal to two sides respectively, but have the one of the angles contained by the equal straight lines greater than the other, they will also have the base greater than the base.

- Let `ABC`, `DEF` be two triangles having the two sides `AB`, `AC` equal to the two sides `DE`, `DF` respectively, namely `AB` to `DE`, and `AC` to `DF`, and let the angle at `A` be greater than the angle at `D`;
- I say that the base `BC` is also greater than the base `EF`.
- For, since the angle `BAC` is greater than the angle `EDF`, let there be constructed, on the straight line `DE`, and at the point `D` on it, the angle `EDG`
        `BAC`; [elem.1.23] let `DG` be made equal to either of the two straight lines `AC`, `DF`, and let `EG`, `FG` be joined.
- Then, since `AB` is equal to `DE`, and `AC` to `DG`, `BA`, `AC` are equal to the two sides `ED`, `DG`, respectively; > and the angle `BAC` is equal to the angle `EDG`; therefore the base `BC` is equal to the base `EG`. [elem.1.4]
- Again, since `DF` is equal to `DG`, > the angle `DGF` is also equal to the angle `DFG`; [elem.1.5] therefore the angle `DFG` is greater than the angle `EGF`.
- Therefore the angle `EFG` is much greater than the angle `EGF`.
- And, since `EFG` is a triangle having the angle `EFG`
        `EGF`, > and the greater angle is subtended by the greater side, [elem.1.19] the side `EG` is also greater than `EF`.
- But `EG` is equal to `BC`. > Therefore `BC` is also greater than `EF`.
- Therefore etc.


# elem.1.25

If two triangles have the two sides equal to two sides respectively, but have the base greater than the base, they will also have the one of the angles contained by the equal straight lines greater than the other.

- Let `ABC`, `DEF` be two triangles having the two sides `AB`, `AC` equal to the two sides `DE`, `DF` respectively, namely `AB` to `DE`, and `AC` to `DF`; and let the base `BC` be greater than the base `EF`;
- I say that the angle `BAC` is also greater than the angle `EDF`.
- For, if not, it is either equal to it or less.
- Now the angle `BAC` is not equal to the angle `EDF`; for then the base `BC` would also have been equal to the base `EF`, [elem.1.4] > but it is not; therefore the angle `BAC` is not equal to the angle `EDF`.
- Neither again is the angle `BAC` less than the angle `EDF`; for then the base `BC` would also have been less than the base `EF`, [elem.1.24] > but it is not; therefore the angle `BAC` is not less than the angle `EDF`.
- But it was proved that it is not equal either; > therefore the angle `BAC` is greater than the angle `EDF`.

If two triangles have the two angles equal to two angles respectively, and one side equal to one side, namely, either the side adjoining the equal angles, or that subtending one of the equal angles, they will also have the remaining sides equal to

- Let `ABC`, `DEF` be two triangles having the two angles `ABC`, `BCA` equal to the two angles `DEF`, `EFD` respectively, namely the angle `ABC` to the angle `DEF`, and the angle `BCA` to the angle `EFD`; and let them also have one side equal to one side, first that adjoining the equal angles, namely `BC` to `EF`;
- I say that they will also have the remaining sides equal to the remaining sides respectively, namely `AB` to `DE` and `AC` to `DF`, and the remaining angle to the remaining angle, namely the angle `BAC` to the angle `EDF`.
- For, if `AB` is unequal to `DE`, one of them is greater.
- Let `AB` be greater, and let `BG` be made equal to `DE`; and let `GC` be joined.
- Then, since `BG` is equal to `DE`, and `BC` to `EF`, the two sides `GB`, `BC` are equal to the two sides `DE`, `EF` respectively; and the angle `GBC` is equal to the angle `DEF`; > therefore the base `GC` is equal to the base `DF`, `GBC` is equal to the triangle `DEF`, and the remaining angles will be equal to the remaining angles, namely those which the equal sides subtend; [elem.1.4] therefore the angle `GCB` is equal to the angle `DFE`. But the angle `DFE` is by hypothesis equal to the angle `BCA`; > therefore the angle `BCG` is equal to the angle `BCA`, the less to the greater: which is impossible. Therefore `AB` is not unequal to `DE`, and is therefore equal to it.
- But `BC` is also equal to `EF`; > therefore the two sides `AB`, `BC` are equal to the two sides `DE`, `EF` respectively, and the angle `ABC` is equal to the angle `DEF`; therefore the base `AC` is equal to the base `DF`, and the remaining angle `BAC` is equal to the remaining `EDF`. [elem.1.4]
- Again, let sides subtending equal angles be equal, as `AB` to `DE`;
- I say again that the remaining sides will be equal to the remaining sides, namely `AC` to `DF` and `BC` to `EF`, and `BAC` is equal to the remaining angle `EDF`.
- For, if `BC` is unequal to `EF`, one of them is greater.
- Let `BC` be greater, if possible, and let `BH` be made equal to `EF`; let `AH` be joined.
- Then, since `BH` is equal to `EF`, and `AB` to `DE`, the two sides `AB`, `BH` are equal to the two sides `DE`, `EF` respectively, and they contain equal angles; > therefore the base `AH` is equal to the base `DF`, and the triangle `ABH` is equal to the triangle `DEF`, elem.1.4] > therefore the angle `BHA` is equal to the angle `EFD`.
- But the angle `EFD` is equal to the angle `BCA`; therefore, in the triangle `AHC`, the exterior angle `BHA` is `BCA`: > which is impossible. [elem.1.16]
- Therefore `BC` is not unequal to `EF`, > and is therefore equal to it.
- But `AB` is also equal to `DE`; `AB`, `BC` are equal to the two sides `DE`, `EF` respectively, and they contain equal angles; > therefore the base `AC` is equal to the base `DF`, the triangle `ABC` equal to the triangle `DEF`, and the remaining angle `BAC` equal to the remaining angle `EDF`. [elem.1.4]
- Therefore etc.


# elem.1.27

If a straight line falling on two straight lines make the alternate angles equal to one another, the straight lines will be parallel to one another.

- For let the straight line `EF` falling on the two straight `AB`, `CD` make the alternate angles `AEF`, `EFD` equal to one another;
- I say that `AB` is parallel to `CD`.
- For, if not, `AB`, `CD` when produced will meet either in the direction `B`, `D` or towards `A`, `C`.
- Let them be produced and meet, in the direction of `B`, `D`, at `G`.
- Then, in the triangle `GEF`, the exterior angle `AEF` is equal to the interior and opposite `EFG`: which is impossible. [elem.1.16]
- Therefore `AB`, `CD` when produced will not meet in the direction of `B`, `D`.
- Similarly it can be proved that neither will they meet `A`, `C`.
- But straight lines which do not meet in either direction are parallel; [elem.1.def.23] > therefore `AB` is parallel to `CD`.

# elem.1.28

If a straight line falling on two straight lines make the exterior angle equal to the interior and opposite angle on the same side, or the interior angles on the same side equal to two right angles, the straight lines will be parallel to one another.

- I say that `AB` is parallel to `CD`.
- For, since the angle `EGB` is equal to the angle `GHD`, while the angle `EGB` is equal to the angle `AGH`, [elem.1.15] `AGH` is also equal to the angle `GHD`; and they are alternate; > therefore `AB` is parallel to `CD`. [elem.1.27]
- Again, since the angles `BGH`, `GHD` are equal to two right angles, and the angles `AGH`, `BGH` are also equal to two right angles, [elem.1.13] the angles `AGH`, `BGH` are equal to the angles `BGH`, `GHD`.
- Let the angle `BGH` be subtracted from each; therefore the remaining angle `AGH` is equal to the remaining angle `GHD`; and they are alternate; > therefore `AB` is parallel to `CD`. [elem.1.27]
- Therefore etc.


# elem.1.29

A straight line falling on parallel straight lines makes the alternate angles equal to one another, the exterior angle equal to the interior and opposite angle, and the interior angles on the same side equal to two right angles.

- I say that it makes the alternate angles `AGH`, `GHD` equal, the exterior angle `EGB` equal to the interior and opposite angle `GHD`, and the interior angles on the same `BGH`, `GHD`, equal to two right angles.
- For, if the angle `AGH` is unequal to the angle `GHD`, one of them is greater.
- Let the angle `AGH` be greater.
- Let the angle `BGH` be added to each; therefore the angles `AGH`, `BGH` are greater than the angles `BGH`, `GHD`.
- But the angles `AGH`, `BGH` are equal to two right angles; [elem.1.13] > therefore the angles `BGH`, `GHD` are less than two right angles.
- But straight lines produced indefinitely from angles less than two right angles meet; [elem.1.post.5] > therefore `AB`, `CD`, if produced indefinitely, will meet; but they do not meet, because they are by hypothesis parallel.
- Therefore the angle `AGH` is not unequal to the angle `GHD`, > and is therefore equal to it.
- Again, the angle `AGH` is equal to the angle `EGB`; [elem.1.15] > therefore the angle `EGB` is also equal to the angle `GHD`. [elem.1.c.n.1]
- Let the angle `BGH` be added to each; > therefore the angles `EGB`, `BGH` are equal to the `BGH`, `GHD`. [elem.1.c.n.2]

Straight lines parallel to the same straight line are also parallel to one another.

- Let each of the straight lines `AB`, `CD` be parallel to `EF`; I say that `AB` is also parallel to `CD`.
- For let the straight line `GK` fall upon them;
- Then, since the straight line `GK` has fallen on the parallel straight lines `AB`, `EF`, > the angle `AGK` is equal to the angle `GHF`. [elem.1.29]
- Again, since the straight line `GK` has fallen on the parallel straight lines `EF`, `CD`, > the angle `GHF` is equal to the angle `GKD`. [elem.1.29]
- But the angle `AGK` was also proved equal to the angle `GHF`; > therefore the angle `AGK` is also equal to the angle `GKD`; [elem.1.c.n.1] and they are alternate.
- Therefore `AB` is parallel to `CD`.

- Then, since the straight line `AD` falling on the two straight lines `BC`, `EF` has made the alternate angles `EAD`, `ADC` equal to one another, > therefore `EAF` is parallel to `BC`. [elem.1.27]

- For let `CE` be drawn through the point `C` parallel to the straight line `AB`. [elem.1.31]
- Then, since `AB` is parallel to `CE`, > and `AC` has fallen upon them, the alternate angles `BAC`, `ACE` are equal to one another. [elem.1.29]
- Again, since `AB` is parallel to `CE`, > and the straight line `BD` has fallen upon them, the exterior angle `ECD` is equal to the interior and opposite angle `ABC`. [elem.1.29]
- But the angle `ACE` was also proved equal to the angle `BAC`; > therefore the whole angle `ACD` is equal to the two interior and opposite angles `BAC`, `ABC`.

- And, since `AB` is equal to `CD`, > and `BC` is common, `AB`, `BC` are equal to the two sides `DC`, `CB`; and the angle `ABC` is equal to the angle `BCD`; therefore the base `AC` is equal to the base `BD`, and the griangle `ABC` is equal to the triangle `DCB`, and the remaining angles will be equal to the remaining angles elem.1.4] therefore the angle `ACB` is equal to the angle `CBD`.

In parallelogrammic areas the opposite sides and angles are equal to one another, and the diameter bisects the areas.

- Let `ACDB` be a parallelogrammic area, and `BC` its diameter; `ACDB` are equal to one another, and the diameter `BC` bisects it.

        `BAC` was also proved equal to the angle `CDB`.
- Therefore in parallelogrammic areas the opposite sides and angles are equal to one another.
- I say, next, that the diameter also bisects the areas.
- For, since `AB` is equal to `CD`, `BC` is common, the two sides `AB`, `BC` are equal to the two sides `DC`, `CB` respectively; > and the angle `ABC` is equal to the angle `BCD`; therefore the base `AC` is also equal to `DB`, `ABC` is equal to the triangle `DCB`. [elem.1.4]

- Let `BC` be bisected at `E`, and let `AE` be joined; on the straight line `EC`, and at the point `E` on it, let the angle `CEF` be constructed equal to the angle `D`; [elem.1.23] through `A` let `AG` be drawn parallel to `EC`, and [elem.1.31] through `C` let `CG` be drawn parallel to `EF`.
- Then `FECG` is a parallelogram.
- And, since `BE` is equal to `EC`, > the triangle `ABE` is also equal to the triangle `AEC`, for they are on equal bases `BE`, `EC` and in the same parallels `BC`, `AG`; [elem.1.38] therefore the triangle `ABC` is double of the triangle `AEC`.
- But the parallelogram `FECG` is also double of the triangle `AEC`, for it has the same base with it and is in the same parallels with it; [elem.1.41] > therefore the parallelogram `FECG` is equal to the triangle `ABC`.
- And it has the angle `CEF` equal to the given angle `D`.
- Therefore the parallelogram `FECG` has been constructed equal to the given triangle `ABC`, in the angle `CEF` which is equal to `D`. Q. E. F.

In any parallelogram the complements of the parallelograms about the diameter are equal to one another.

- Let `ABCD` be a parallelogram, and `AC` its diameter; and about `AC` let `EH`, `FG` be parallelograms, and `BK`, `KD`
- I say that the complement `BK` is equal to the complement `KD`.
- For, since `ABCD` is a parallelogram, and `AC` its diameter, > the triangle `ABC` is equal to `ACD`. [elem.1.34]
- Again, since `EH` is a parallelogram, and `AK` is its diameter, > the triangle `AEK` is equal to the triangle `AHK`.
        > the triangle `KFC` is also equal to `KGC`.
- Now, since the triangle `AEK` is equal to the triangle `AHK`, > and `KFC` to `KGC`,
        `AEK` together with `KGC` is equal to the triangle `AHK` together with `KFC`. [elem.1.c.n.2]
- And the whole triangle `ABC` is also equal to the whole `ADC`; therefore the complement `BK` which remains is equal to the `KD` which remains. [elem.1.c.n.3]
- Therefore etc.


# elem.1.44

To a given straight line to apply, in a given rectilineal angle, a parallelogram equal to a given triangle.

- Let `AB` be the given straight line, `C` the given triangle and `D` the given rectilineal angle; `AB`, in an angle equal to the angle `D`, a parallelogram equal to the given triangle `C`.
- Let the parallelogram `BEFG` be constructed equal to the triangle `C`, in the angle `EBG` which is equal to `D` [elem.1.42]; `BE` is in a straight line with `AB`; let`FG` be drawn through to `H`, and let `AH` be drawn through `A` parallel to either `BG` or `EF`. [elem.1.31]
- Let `HB` be joined.
- Then, since the straight line `HF` falls upon the parallels `AH`, `EF`, > the angles `AHF`, `HFE` are equal to two right angles. [elem.1.29] Therefore the angles `BHG`, `GFE` are less than two right angles; and straight lines produced indefinitely from angles less than elem.1.post.5] > therefore `HB`, `FE`, when produced, will meet.
- Let them be produced and meet at `K`; through the point `K` let `KL` be drawn parallel to either `EA` or `FH`, [elem.1.31] and let `HA`, `GB` be produced to the points `L`, `M`.
- Then `HLKF` is a parallelogram, `HK` is its diameter, and `AG`, `ME` are parallelograms. and `LB`, `BF` the so-called complements, about `HK`; > therefore `LB` is equal to `BF`. [elem.1.43]
- But `BF` is equal to the triangle `C`; > therefore `LB` is also equal to `C`. [elem.1.c.n.1]
- And, since the angle `GBE` is equal to the angle `ABM`, [elem.1.15] > while the angle `GBE` is equal to `D`, the angle `ABM` is also equal to the angle `D`.
- Therefore the parallelogram `LB` equal to the given triangle `C` has been applied to the given straight line `AB`, in the angle `ABM` which is equal to `D`.


# elem.1.45

To construct, in a given rectilineal angle, a parallelogram equal to a given rectilineal figure.

- Let `ABCD` be the given rectilineal figure and `E` the given rectilineal angle; `E`, a parallelogram equal to the rectilineal figure `ABCD`.
- Let `DB` be joined, and let the parallelogram `FH` be constructed equal to the triangle `ABD`, in the angle `HKF` which is equal to `E`; [elem.1.42] `GM` equal to the triangle `DBC` be applied to the straight line `GH`, in the angle `GHM` which is equal to `E`. [elem.1.44]
- Then, since the angle `E` is equal to each of the angles `HKF`, `GHM`, > the angle `HKF` is also equal to the angle `GHM`. [elem.1.c.n.1]
- Let the angle `KHG` be added to each; therefore the angles `FKH`, `KHG` are equal to the angles `KHG`, `GHM`.
- But the angles `FKH`, `KHG` are equal to two right angles; [elem.1.29] `KHG`, `GHM` are also equal to two right angles.
- Thus, with a straight line `GH`, and at the point `H` on it, two straight lines `KH`, `HM` not lying on the same side make the adjacent angles equal to two right angles; > therefore `KH` is in a straight line with `HM`. [elem.1.14]
- And, since the straight line `HG` falls upon the parallels `KM`, `FG`, the alternate angles `MHG`, `HGF` are equal to one another. [elem.1.29]
- Let the angle `HGL` be added to each; `MHG`, `HGL` are equal to the angles `HGF`, `HGL`. [elem.1.c.n.2]
- But the angles `MHG`, `HGL` are equal to two right angles; [elem.1.29] therefore the angles `HGF`, `HGL` are also equal to two right angles. [elem.1.c.n.1] > Therefore `FG` is in a straight line with `GL`. [elem.1.14]
- And, since `FK` is equal and parallel to `HG`, [elem.1.34] > and `HG` to `ML` also,
        `KF` is also equal and parallel to `ML`; [elem.1.c.n.1;elem.1.30] and the straight lines `KM`, `FL` join them (at their extremities); `KM`, `FL` are also equal and parallel. [elem.1.33] > Therefore `KFLM` is a parallelogram.
- And, since the triangle `ABD` is equal to the parallelogram `FH`, > and `DBC` to `GM`,
        `ABCD` is equal to the whole parallelogram `KFLM`.
- Therefore the parallelogram `KFLM` has been constructed equal to the given rectilineal figure `ABCD`, in the angle `FKM` which is equal to the given angle `E`.


# elem.1.46

On a given straight line to describe a square.

- Let `AB` be the given straight line; thus it is required to describe a square on the straight line `AB`.
- Let `AC` be drawn at right angles to the straight line `AB` from the point `A` on it [elem.1.11], and let `AD` be made equal to `AB`; through the point `D` let `DE` be drawn `AB`, and through the point `B` let `BE` be drawn parallel to `AD`. [elem.1.31]
- Therefore `ADEB` is a parallelogram; > therefore `AB` is equal to `DE`, and `AD` to `BE`. [elem.1.34]
- But `AB` is equal to `AD`; > therefore the four straight lines `BA`, `AD`, `DE`, `EB` are equal to one another; therefore the parallelogram `ADEB` is equilateral.
- I say next that it is also right-angled.
- For, since the straight line `AD` falls upon the parallels `AB`, `DE`, > the angles `BAD`, `ADE` are equal to two right angles. [elem.1.29]
- But the angle `BAD` is right; > therefore the angle `ADE` is also right.
- And in parallelogrammic areas the opposite sides and elem.1.34] > therefore each of the opposite angles `ABE`, `BED` is also right. Therefore `ADEB` is right-angled.
- And it was also proved equilateral.
- Therefore it is a square; and it is described on the straight line `AB`.


# elem.1.47

In right-angled triangles the square on the side subtending the right angle is equal to the squares on the sides containing the right angle.

- Let `ABC` be a right-angled triangle having the angle `BAC` right;
- I say that the square on `BC` is equal to the squares on `BA`, `AC`.
- For let there be described on `BC` the square `BDEC`, `BA`, `AC` the squares `GB`, `HC`; [elem.1.46] through `A` let `AL` be drawn parallel to either `BD` or `CE`, and let `AD`, `FC` be joined.
- Then, since each of the angles `BAC`, `BAG` is right, it follows that with a straight line `BA`, and at the point `A` on it, the two straight lines `AC`, `AG` not lying on the same side make the adjacent angles equal to two right angles; > therefore `CA` is in a straight line with `AG`. [elem.1.14]
- For the same reason > `BA` is also in a straight line with `AH`.
- And, since the angle `DBC` is equal to the angle `FBA`: for each is right: let the angle `ABC` be added to each; > therefore the whole angle `DBA` is equal to the whole angle `FBC`. [elem.1.c.n.2]
- And, since `DB` is equal to `BC`, and `FB` to `BA`, the two sides `AB`, `BD` are equal to the two sides `FB`, `BC` respectively, > and the angle `ABD` is equal to the angle `FBC`; therefore the base `AD` is equal to the base `FC`, and the triangle `ABD` is equal to the triangle `FBC`. [elem.1.4]
- Now the parallelogram `BL` is double of the triangle `ABD`, for they have the same base `BD` and are in the same parallels `BD`, `AL`. [elem.1.41]
- And the square `GB` is double of the triangle `FBC`, for they again have the same base `FB` and are in the same parallels `FB`, `GC`. [elem.1.41]
- [But the doubles of equals are equal to one another.] > Therefore the parallelogram `BL` is also equal to the square `GB`.
- Similarly, if `AE`, `BK` be joined, the parallelogram `CL` can also be proved equal to the square `HC`; > therefore the whole square `BDEC` is equal to the two squares `GB`, `HC`. [elem.1.c.n.2]
- And the square `BDEC` is described on `BC`, > and the squares `GB`, `HC` on `BA`, `AC`.
- Therefore the square on the side `BC` is equal to the `BA`, `AC`.
- Therefore etc.


# elem.1.48

If in a triangle the square on one of the sides be equal to the squares on the remaining two sides of the triangle, the angle contained by the remaining two sides of the triangle is right.

- For in the triangle `ABC` let the square on one side `BC` be equal to the squares on the sides `BA`, `AC`;
- I say that the angle `BAC` is right.
- For let `AD` be drawn from the point `A` at right angles to the straight line `AC`, let `AD` be made equal to `BA`, and let `DC` be joined.
- Since `DA` is equal to `AB`, the square on `DA` is also equal to the square on `AB`.
- Let the square on `AC` be added to each; > therefore the squares on `DA`, `AC` are equal to the squares on `BA`, `AC`.
- But the square on `DC` is equal to the squares on `DA`, `AC`, for the angle `DAC` is right; [elem.1.47] and the square on `BC` is equal to the squares on `BA`, `AC`, for this is the hypothesis; > therefore the square on `DC` is equal to the square on `BC`, so that the side `DC` is also equal to `BC`.
- And, since `DA` is equal to `AB`, and `AC` is common, > the two sides `DA`, `AC` are equal to the two sides `BA`, `AC`; and the base `DC` is equal to the base `BC`; > therefore the angle `DAC` is equal to the angle `BAC`. [elem.1.8] But the angle `DAC` is right; > therefore the angle `BAC` is also right.
- Therefore etc.
