# elem.2.1

`If there be two straight lines`, `and one of them be cut into any number of segments whatever`, `the rectangle contained by the two straight lines is equal to the rectangles contained by the uncut straight line and each of the segments`.

- Let `A`, `BC` be two straight lines, and let `BC` be cut at random at the points `D`, `E`; I say that the rectangle contained by `A`, `BC` is equal to the rectangle contained by `A`, `BD`, that contained by `A`, `DE` and `A`, `EC`.
- For let `BF` be drawn from `B` at right angles to `BC`; [elem.1.11] let `BG` be made equal to `A`, [elem.1.3] through `G` let `GH` be drawn `BC`, [elem.1.31] and through `D`, `E`, `C` let `DK`, `EL`, `CH` be drawn parallel to `BG`.
- Then `BH` is equal to `BK`, `DL`, `EH`.
- Now `BH` is the rectangle `A`, `BC`, for it is contained by `GB`, `BC`, and `BG` is equal to `A`;
- `BK` is the rectangle `A`, `BD`, for it is contained by `GB`, `BD`, and `BG` is equal to `A`; > and `DL` is the rectangle `A`, `DE`, for `DK`, that is `BG` [elem.1.34], `A`.
- Similarly also `EH` is the rectangle `A`, `EC`.
- Therefore the rectangle `A`, `BC` is equal to the rectangle `A`, `BD`, the rectangle `A`, `DE` and the rectangle `A`, `EC`.
- Therefore etc. Q. E. D.


# elem.2.2

`If a straight line be cut at random`, `the rectangle contained by the whole and both of the segments is equal to the square on the whole`.

- For let the straight line `AB` be cut at random at the point `C`; I say that the rectangle contained by `AB`, `BC` together with the rectangle contained by `BA`, `AC` is equal to the square on `AB`.
- For let the square `ADEB` be described on `AB` [elem.1.46], and let `CF` be drawn through `C` parallel to either `AD` or `BE`. [elem.1.31]
- Then `AE` is equal to `AF`, `CE`.
- Now `AE` is the square on `AB`;
- `AF` is the rectangle contained by `BA`, `AC`, for it is contained by `DA`, `AC`, and `AD` is equal to `AB`; > and `CE` is the rectangle `AB`, `BC`, for `BE` is equal to `AB`.
- Therefore the rectangle `BA`, `AC` together with the rectangle `AB`, `BC` is equal to the square on `AB`.
- Therefore etc. Q. E. D.


# elem.2.3

`If a straight line be cut at random`, `the rectangle contained by the whole and one of the segments is equal to the rectangle contained by the segments and the square on the aforesaid segment`.

- For let the straight line `AB` be cut at random at `C`; I say that the rectangle contained by `AB`, `BC` is equal to the rectangle contained by `AC`, `CB` together with the square on `BC`.
- For let the square `CDEB` be described on `CB`; [elem.1.46] let `ED` be drawn through to `F`, and through `A` let `AF` be drawn parallel to either `CD` or `BE`. [elem.1.31]
- Then `AE` is equal to `AD`, `CE`.
- Now `AE` is the rectangle contained by `AB`, `BC`, for it is contained by `AB`, `BE`, and `BE` is equal to `BC`;
- `AD` is the rectangle `AC`, `CB`, for `DC` is equal to `CB`; > and `DB` is the square on `CB`. Therefore the rectangle contained by `AB`, `BC` is equal to the rectangle contained by `AC`, `CB` together with the square on `BC`.
- Therefore etc. Q. E. D.


# elem.2.4

`If a straight line be cut at random`, `the square on the whole is equal to the squares on the segments and twice the rectangle contained by the segments`.

- For let the straight line `AB` be cut at random at `C`; `AB` is equal to the squares on `AC`, `CB` and twice the rectangle contained by `AC`, `CB`.
- For let the square `ADEB` be described on `AB`, [elem.1.46] `BD` be joined; through `C` let `CF` be drawn parallel to either `AD` or `EB`, and through `G` let `HK` be drawn parallel to either `AB` or `DE`. [elem.1.31]
- Then, since `CF` is parallel to `AD`, and `BD` has fallen on them, the exterior angle `CGB` is equal to the interior and opposite angle `ADB`. [elem.1.29]
- But the angle `ADB` is equal to the angle `ABD`, > since the side `BA` is also equal to `AD`; [elem.1.5] therefore the angle `CGB` is also equal to the angle `GBC`, so that the side `BC` is also equal to the side `CG`. [elem.1.6]
- But `CB` is equal to `GK`, and `CG` to `KB`; [elem.1.34] > therefore `GK` is also equal to `KB`; `CGKB` is equilateral.
- I say next that it is also right-angled.
- For, since `CG` is parallel to `BK`, > the angles `KBC`, `GCB` are equal to two right angles. [elem.1.29]
- But the angle `KBC` is right; > therefore the angle `BCG` is also right, so that the opposite angles `CGK`, `GKB` are also right. [elem.1.34]
- Therefore `CGKB` is right-angled; and it was also proved equilateral; > therefore it is a square; `CB`.
- For the same reason > `HF` is also a square; and it is described on `HG`, that is `AC`. [elem.1.34]
- Therefore the squares `HF`, `KC` are the squares on `AC`, `CB`.
- Now, since `AG` is equal to `GE`, and `AG` is the rectangle `AC`, `CB`, for `GC` is equal to `CB`, > therefore `GE` is also equal to the rectangle `AC`, `CB`.
- Therefore `AG`, `GE` are equal to twice the rectangle `AC`, `CB`.
- But the squares `HF`, `CK` are also the squares on `AC`, `CB`; therefore the four areas `HF`, `CK`, `AG`, `GE` are equal to the squares on `AC`, `CB` and twice the rectangle contained by `AC`, `CB`.
- But `HF`, `CK`, `AG`, `GE` are the whole `ADEB`, `AB`.
- Therefore the square on `AB` is equal to the squares on `AC`, `CB` and twice the rectangle contained by `AC`, `CB`.
- Therefore etc. Q. E. D.


# elem.2.5

`If a straight line be cut into equal and unequal segments, the rectangle contained by the unequal segments of the whole together with the square on the straight line between the points of section is equal to the square on the half`.

- For let a straight line `AB` be cut into equal segments at `C` and into unequal segments at `D`; I say that the rectangle contained by `AD`, `DB` together with the square on `CD` is equal to the square on `CB`.
- For let the square `CEFB` be described on `CB`, [elem.1.46] and let `BE` be joined; through `D` let `DG` be drawn parallel to either `CE` or `BF`, through `H` again let `KM` be drawn parallel to either `AB` or `EF`, and again through `A` let `AK` be drawn parallel to either `CL` or `BM`. [elem.1.31]
- Then, since the complement `CH` is equal to the complement `HF`, [elem.1.43] let `DM` be added to each; > therefore the whole `CM` is equal to the whole `DF`.
- But `CM` is equal to `AL`, > since `AC` is also equal to `CB`; [elem.1.36] therefore `AL` is also equal to `DF`. Let `CH` be added to each; > therefore the whole `AH` is equal to the gnomon `NOP`.
- But `AH` is the rectangle `AD`, `DB`, for `DH` is equal to `DB`, > therefore the gnomon `NOP` is also equal to the rectangle `AD`, `DB`.
- Let `LG`, which is equal to the square on `CD`, be added to each; > therefore the gnomon `NOP` and `LG` are equal to the rectangle contained by `AD`, `DB` and the square on `CD`.
- But the gnomon `NOP` and `LG` are the whole square `CEFB`, which is described on `CB`; > therefore the rectangle contained by `AD`, `DB` together with the square on `CD` is equal to the square on `CB`.
- Therefore etc. Q. E. D.


# elem.2.6

`If a straight line be bisected and a straight line be added to it in a straight line`, `the rectangle contained by the whole with the added straight line and the added straight line together with the square on the half is equal to the square on the straight line made up of the half and the added straight line`.

- For let a straight line `AB` be bisected at the point `C`, and let a straight line `BD` be added to it in a straight line;
- I say that the rectangle contained by `AD`, `DB` together with the square on `CB` is equal to the square on `CD`.
- For let the square `CEFD` be described on `CD`, [elem.1.46] and let `DE` be joined; through the point `B` let `BG` be drawn parallel to either `EC` or `DF`, `H` let `KM` be drawn parallel to either `AB` or `EF`, and further through `A` let `AK` be drawn parallel to either `CL` or `DM`. [elem.1.31] > Then, since `AC` is equal to `CB`, `AL` is also equal to `CH`. [elem.1.36] But `CH` is equal to `HF`. [elem.1.43] > Therefore `AL` is also equal to `HF`.
- Let `CM` be added to each; > therefore the whole `AM` is equal to the gnomon `NOP`.
- But `AM` is the rectangle `AD`, `DB`, > for `DM` is equal to `DB`; therefore the gnomon `NOP` is also equal to the rectangle `AD`, `DB`.
- Let `LG`, which is equal to the square on `BC`, be added to each; > therefore the rectangle contained by `AD`, `DB` together with the square on `CB` is equal to the gnomon `NOP` and `LG`.
- But the gnomon `NOP` and `LG` are the whole square `CEFD`, which is described on `CD`; > therefore the rectangle contained by `AD`, `DB` together with the square on `CB` is equal to the square on `CD`.
- Therefore etc. Q. E. D.


# elem.2.7

`If a straight line be cut at random`, `the square on the whole and that on one of the segments both together are equal to twice the rectangle contained by the whole and the said segment and the square on the remaining segment`.

- For let a straight line `AB` be cut at random at the point `C`;
- I say that the squares on `AB`, `BC` are equal to twice the rectangle contained by `AB`, `BC` and the square on `CA`.
- For let the square `ADEB` be described on `AB`, [elem.1.46] and let the figure be drawn.
- Then, since `AG` is equal to `GE`, [elem.1.43] let `CF` be added to each; > therefore the whole `AF` is equal to the whole `CE`.
- Therefore `AF`, `CE` are double of `AF`.
- But `AF`, `CE` are the gnomon `KLM` and the square `CF`; therefore the gnomon `KLM` and the square `CF` are double of `AF`.
- But twice the rectangle `AB`, `BC` is also double of `AF`; for `BF` is equal to `BC`; therefore the gnomon `KLM` and the square `CF` are equal to twice the rectangle `AB`, `BC`.
- Let `DG`, which is the square on `AC`, be added to each; therefore the gnomon `KLM` and the squares `BG`, `GD` are equal to twice the rectangle contained by `AB`, `BC` and the square on `AC`.
- But the gnomon `KLM` and the squares `BG`, `GD` are the whole `ADEB` and `CF`, > which are squares described on `AB`, `BC`; therefore the squares on `AB`, `BC` are equal to twice the rectangle contained by `AB`, `BC` together with the square on `AC`.
- Therefore etc. Q. E. D.


# elem.2.8

`If a straight line be cut at random`, `four times the rectangle contained by the whole and one of the segments together with the square on the remaining segment is equal to the square described on the whole and the aforesaid segment as on one straight line`.

- For let a straight line `AB` be cut at random at the point `C`;
- I say that four times the rectangle contained by `AB`, `BC` together with the square on `AC` is equal to the square described on `AB`, `BC` as on one straight line.
- For let [the straight line] `BD` be produced in a straight line [with `AB`], and let `BD` be made equal to `CB`; let the square `AEFD` be described on `AD`, and let the figure be drawn double.
- Then, since `CB` is equal to `BD`, while `CB` is equal to `GK`, and `BD` to `KN`, therefore `GK` is also equal to `KN`.
- For the same reason > `QR` is also equal to `RP`.
- And, since `BC` is equal to `BD`, and `GK` to `KN`, therefore `CK` is also equal to `KD`, and `GR` to `RN`. [elem.1.36]
- But `CK` is equal to `RN`, for they are complements of the parallelogram `CP`; [elem.1.43] therefore `KD` is also equal to `GR`; therefore the four areas `DK`, `CK`, `GR`, `RN` are equal to one another. > Therefore the four are quadruple of `CK`.
- Again, since `CB` is equal to `BD`, while `BD` is equal to `BK`, that is `CG`, and `CB` is equal to `GK`, that is `GQ`, > therefore `CG` is also equal to `GQ`.
- And, since `CG` is equal to `GQ`, and `QR` to `RP`, > `AG` is also equal to `MQ`, and `QL` to `RF`. [elem.1.36]
- But `MQ` is equal to `QL`, for they are complements of the parallelogram `ML`; [elem.1.43] > therefore `AG` is also equal to `RF`; therefore the four areas `AG`, `MQ`, `QL`, `RF` are equal to one another. > Therefore the four are quadruple of `AG`. But the four areas `CK`, `KD`, `GR`, `RN` were proved to be quadruple of `CK`; > therefore the eight areas, which contain the gnomon `STU`, are quadruple of `AK`.
- Now, since `AK` is the rectangle `AB`, `BD`, for `BK` is equal to `BD`, `AB`, `BD` is quadruple of `AK`.
- But the gnomon `STU` was also proved to be quadruple of `AK`; > therefore four times the rectangle `AB`, `BD` is equal to the gnomon `STU`.
- Let `OH`, which is equal to the square on `AC`, be added to each; > therefore four times the rectangle `AB`, `BD` together with the square on `AC` is equal to the gnomon `STU` and `OH`.
- But the gnomon `STU` and `OH` are the whole square `AEFD`, > which is described on `AD`. therefore four times the rectangle `AB`, `BD` together with the square on `AC` is equal to the square on `AD`
- But `BD` is equal to `BC`; therefore four times the rectangle contained by `AB`, `BC` together with the square on `AC` is equal to the square on `AD`, that is to the square described on `AB` and `BC` as on one straight line.
- Therefore etc. Q. E. D.


# elem.2.9

`If a straight line be cut into equal and unequal segments`, `the squares on the unequal segments of the whole are double of the square on the half and of the square on the straight line between the points of section`.

- And, since the angle at `C` is right, > the remaining angles `EAC`, `AEC` are equal to one right angle. [elem.1.32]
- And they are equal; > therefore each of the angles `CEA`, `CAE` is half a right angle.
- For the same reason > each of the angles `CEB`, `EBC` is also half a right angle; therefore the whole angle `AEB` is right.
- And, since the angle `GEF` is half a right angle, `EGF` is right, for it is equal to the interior and opposite angle `ECB`, [elem.1.29] > the remaining angle `EFG` is half a right angle; [elem.1.32] therefore the angle `GEF` is equal to the angle `EFG`, so that the side `EG` is also equal to `GF`.

- And the square on `AF` is equal to the squares on `AE`, `EF`, for the angle `AEF` is right; [elem.1.47] therefore the square on `AF` is double of the squares on `AC`, `CD`.
- But the squares on `AD`, `DF` are equal to the square on `AF`, for the angle at `D` is right; [elem.1.47] therefore the squares on `AD`, `DF` are double of the squares on `AC`, `CD`.

- For let `CE` be drawn from the point `C` at right angles to `AB` [elem.1.11], and let it be made equal to either `AC` or `CB` [elem.1.3]; let `EA`, `EB` be joined; through `E` let `EF` be drawn parallel to `AD`, and through `D` let `FD` be drawn parallel to `CE`. [elem.1.31]
- Then, since a straight line `EF` falls on the parallel straight lines `EC`, `FD`, > the angles `CEF`, `EFD` are equal to two right angles; [elem.1.29] therefore the angles `FEB`, `EFD` are less than two right angles.

- But the squares on `HE`, `EG` are equal to the square on `GH`; [elem.1.47] `BE`, `EF` together with the square on `GE` is equal to the squares on `HE`, `EG`.
- Let the square on `GE` be subtracted from each; > therefore the rectangle contained by `BE`, `EF` which remains is equal to the square on `EH`.
- But the rectangle `BE`, `EF` is `BD`, for `EF` is equal to `ED`; > therefore the parallelogram `BD` is equal to the square on `HE`.
- And `BD` is equal to the rectilineal figure `A`.
- Therefore the rectilineal figure `A` is also equal to the square `EH`.
- Therefore a square, namely that which can be described on `EH`, has been constructed equal to the given rectilineal figure `A`. Q. E. F.
