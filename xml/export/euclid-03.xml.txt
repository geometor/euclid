`To find the centre of a given circle`.

- Let `ABC` be the given circle; thus it is required to find the centre of the circle `ABC`.
- Let a straight line `AB` be drawn `D`; from `D` let `DC` be drawn at right angles to `AB` and let it be drawn through to `E`; let `CE` be bisected at `F`; `F` is the centre of the circle `ABC`.
- For suppose it is not, but, if possible, let `G` be the centre, and let `GA`, `GD`, `GB` be joined.
- Then, since `AD` is equal to `DB`, and `DG` is common, > the two sides `AD`, `DG` are equal to the two sides `BD`, `DG` respectively; and the base `GA` is equal to the base `GB`, for they are > therefore the angle `ADG` is equal to the angle `GDB`. [elem.1.8]
- But, when a straight line set up on a straight line makes the adjacent angles equal to one another, each of the equal angles is right; [elem.1.def.10] > therefore the angle `GDB` is right.
- But the angle `FDB` is also right; therefore the angle `FDB` is equal to the angle `GDB`, the greater to the less: which is impossible. > Therefore `G` is not the centre of the circle `ABC`.
- Similarly we can prove that neither is any other point except `F`. > Therefore the point `F` is the centre of the circle `ABC`.


# elem.3.2

`If on the circumference of a circle two points be taken at random`, `the straight line joining the points will fall within the circle`.

- Let `ABC` be a circle, and let two points `A`, `B` be taken at random on its circumference; I say that the straight line joined from `A` to `B` will fall within the circle.
- For suppose it does not, but, if possible, let it fall outside, as `AEB`; let the centre of the circle `ABC` be taken [elem.3.1], and let it be `D`; let `DA`, `DB` be joined, and let `DFE` be drawn through.
- Then, since `DA` is equal to `DB`, > the angle `DAE` is also equal to the angle `DBE`. [elem.1.5] And, since one side `AEB` of the triangle `DAE` is produced, > the angle `DEB` is greater than the angle `DAE`. [elem.1.16]
- But the angle `DAE` is equal to the angle `DBE`; > therefore the angle `DEB` is greater than the angle `DBE`. And the greater angle is subtended by the greater side; [elem.1.19] > therefore `DB` is greater than `DE`. But `DB` is equal to `DF`;
       > therefore `DF` is greater than `DE`,
       > the less than the greater : which is impossible.
- Therefore the straight line joined from `A` to `B` will not fall outside the circle.
- Similarly we can prove that neither will it fall on the circumference itself; > therefore it will fall within.

# elem.3.3

`If in a circle a straight line through the centre bisect a straight line not through the centre`, `it also cuts it at right angles; and if it cut it at right angles`, `it also bisects it`.

- Let `ABC` be a circle, and in it let a straight line `CD`
       `AB` not through the centre at the point `F`;
- For let the centre of the circle `ABC`
       `E`; let `EA`, `EB` be joined.
- Then, since `AF` is equal to `FB`, and `FE` is common, > two sides are equal to two sides;
       > and the base `EA` is equal to the base `EB`; therefore the angle `AFE` is equal to the angle `BFE`. [elem.1.8]
- But, when a straight line set up on a straight line makes the adjacent angles equal to one another, each of the equal angles is right; [elem.1.def.10] > therefore each of the angles `AFE`, `BFE` is right.
- Therefore `CD`, which is through the centre, and bisects `AB` which is not through the centre, also cuts it at right angles.
- Again, let `CD` cut `AB` at right angles; `AF` is equal to `FB`.
- For, with the same construction, > since `EA` is equal to `EB`, the angle `EAF` is also equal to the angle `EBF`. [elem.1.5]
- But the right angle `AFE` is equal to the right angle `BFE`, `EAF`, `EBF` are two triangles having two angles equal to two angles and one side equal to one side, namely `EF`, which is common to them, and subtends one of the equal angles; > therefore they will also have the remaining sides equal to elem.1.26] therefore `AF` is equal to `FB`.
- Therefore etc. Q. E. D.


# elem.3.4

`If in a circle two straight lines cut one another which are not through the centre`, `they do not bisect one another`.

- Let `ABCD` be a circle, and in it let the two straight lines `AC`, `BD`, which are not through the centre, cut one another at `E`;
- For, if possible, let them bisect one another, so that `AE` is equal to `EC`, and `BE` to `ED`; let the centre of the circle `ABCD` be taken [elem.3.1], and let it be `F`; let `FE` be joined.
- Then, since a straight line `FE` through the centre bisects a straight line `AC` not through the centre, > it also cuts it at right angles; [elem.3.3] therefore the angle `FEA` is right.
- Again, since a straight line `FE` bisects a straight line `BD`, > it also cuts it at right angles; [elem.3.3] therefore the angle `FEB` is right.
- But the angle `FEA` was also proved right; > therefore the angle `FEA` is equal to the angle `FEB`, the less to the greater: which is impossible.
- Therefore `AC`, `BD` do not bisect one another.
- Therefore etc. Q. E. D.


# elem.3.5

`If two circles cut one another`, `they will not have the same centre`.

- For let the circles `ABC`, `CDG` cut one another at the points `B`, `C`; I say that they will not have the same centre.
- For, if possible, let it be `E`; let `EC` be joined, and let `EFG` be drawn through at random.
- Then, since the point `E` is the centre of the circle `ABC`, > `EC` is equal to `EF`. [elem.1.def.15]
- Again, since the point `E` is the centre of the circle `CDG`, > `EC` is equal to `EG`.
- But `EC` was proved equal to `EF` also; > therefore `EF` is also equal to `EG`, the less to the greater : which is impossible.
- Therefore the point `E` is not the centre of the circles `ABC`, `CDG`.
- Therefore etc. Q. E. D.


# elem.3.6

`If two circles touch one another`, `they will not have the same centre`.

- For let the two circles `ABC`, `CDE` touch one another at the point `C`; I say that they will not have the same centre.
- For, if possible, let it be `F`; let `FC` be joined, and let `FEB` be drawn through at random.
- Then, since the point `F` is the centre of the circle `ABC`, > `FC` is equal to `FB`.
- Again, since the point `F` is the centre of the circle `CDE`, > `FC` is equal to `FE`.
- But `FC` was proved equal to `FB`; > therefore `FE` is also equal to `FB`, the less to the greater: which is impossible.
- Therefore `F` is not the centre of the circles `ABC`, `CDE`.
- Therefore etc. Q. E. D.


# elem.3.7

`If on the diameter of a circle a point be taken which is not the centre of the circle`, `and from the point straight lines fall upon the circle`, `that will be greatest on which the centre is`, `the remainder of the same diameter will be least`, `and of the rest`
       `the nearer to the straight line through the centre is always greater than the more remote`, `and only two equal straight lines will fall from the point on the circle`, `one on each side of the least straight line`.

- Let `ABCD` be a circle, and let `AD` be a diameter of it; `AD` let a point `F` be taken which is not the centre of the circle, let `E` be the centre of the circle, and from `F` let straight lines `FB`, `FC`, `FG` fall upon the circle `ABCD`; I say that `FA` is greatest, `FD` is least, and of the rest `FB` is `FC`, and `FC` than `FG`.
- For let `BE`, `CE`, `GE` be joined.
- Then, since in any triangle two sides are greater than the remaining one, [elem.1.20] > `EB`, `EF` are greater than `BF`.
- But `AE` is equal to `BE`; > therefore `AF` is greater than `BF`.
- Again, since `BE` is equal to `CE`, and `FE` is common, `BE`, `EF` are equal to the two sides `CE`, `EF`.
- But the angle `BEF` is also greater than the angle `CEF`; therefore the base `BF` is greater than the base `CF`. [elem.1.24]
- For the same reason > `CF` is also greater than `FG`.
- Again, since `GF`, `FE` are greater than `EG`, and `EG` is equal to `ED`, > `GF`, `FE` are greater than `ED`.
- Let `EF` be subtracted from each; > therefore the remainder `GF` is greater than the remainder `FD`.
- Therefore `FA` is greatest, `FD` is least, and `FB` is greater than `FC`, and `FC` than `FG`.
- I say also that from the point `F` only two equal straight lines will fall on the circle `ABCD`, one on each side of the `FD`.
- For on the straight line `EF`, and at the point `E` on it, let the angle `FEH` be constructed equal to the angle `GEF` [elem.1.23], and let `FH` be joined.
- Then, since `GE` is equal to `EH`, `EF` is common, > the two sides `GE`, `EF` are equal to the two sides `HE`, `EF`; and the angle `GEF` is equal to the angle `HEF`;
       > therefore the base `FG` is equal to the base `FH`. [elem.1.4]
- I say again that another straight line equal to `FG` will not `F`.
- For, if possible, let `FK` so fall.
- Then, since `FK` is equal to `FG`, and `FH` to `FG`, > `FK` is also equal to `FH`, the nearer to the straight line through the centre being
- Therefore another straight line equal to `GF` will not fall from the point `F` upon the circle; > therefore only one straight line will so fall.
- Therefore etc. Q. E. D.


# elem.3.8

`If a point be taken outside a circle and from the point straight lines be drawn through to the circle`, `one of which is through the centre and the others are drawn at random`, `then`, `of the straight lines which fall on the concave circumference`, `that through the centre is greatest`, `while of the rest`
       `the nearer to that through the centre is always greater than the more remote`, `but`, `of the straight lines falling on the convex circumference`, `that between the point and the diameter is least`, `while of the rest the nearer to the least is always less than the more remote`, `and only two equal straight lines will fall on the circle from the point`, `one on each side of the least`.

- Let `ABC` be a circle, and let a point `D` be taken outside `ABC`; let there be drawn through from it straight lines `DA`, `DE`, `DF`, `DC`, and let `DA` be through the centre; I say that, of the straight lines falling on the concave circumference `AEFC`, the straight line `DA` through the centre is greatest, `DE` is greater than `DF` and `DF` than `DC`.; but, of the straight lines falling on the convex circumference `HLKG`, the straight line `DG` between the point and the diameter `AG` is least; and the nearer to the least `DG` is always less than the more remote, namely `DK` than `DL`, and `DL` than `DH`.
- For let the centre of the circle `ABC` be taken [elem.3.1], and let it be `M`; let `ME`, `MF`, `MC`, `MK`, `ML`, `MH` be joined.
- Then, since `AM` is equal to `EM`, let `MD` be added to each; > therefore `AD` is equal to `EM`, `MD`.
- But `EM`, `MD` are greater than `ED`; [elem.1.20] > therefore `AD` is also greater than `ED`.
- Again, since `ME` is equal to `MF`, > and `MD` is common, therefore `EM`, `MD` are equal to `FM`, `MD`; > and the angle `EMD` is greater than the angle `FMD`;
       > therefore the base `ED` is greater than the base `FD`. [elem.1.24]
- Similarly we can prove that `FD` is greater than `CD`; therefore `DA` is greatest, while `DE` is greater than `DF`, and `DF` than `DC`.
- Next, since `MK`, `KD` are greater than `MD`, [elem.1.20] and `MG` is equal to `MK`, therefore the remainder `KD` is greater than the remainder `GD`, > so that `GD` is less than `KD`.
- And, since on `MD`, one of the sides of the triangle `MLD`, two straight lines `MK`, `KD` were constructed meeting within the triangle, therefore `MK`, `KD` are less than `ML`, `LD`; [elem.1.21] and `MK` is equal to `ML`; > therefore the remainder `DK` is less than the remainder `DL`.
- Similarly we can prove that `DL` is also less than `DH`; > therefore `DG` is least, while `DK` is less than `DL`, and `DL` than `DH`.
- I say also that only two equal straight lines will fall from the point `D` on the circle, one on each side of the least `DG`.
- On the straight line `MD`, and at the point `M` on it, let the angle `DMB` be constructed equal to the angle `KMD`, and let `DB` be joined.
- Then, since `MK` is equal to `MB`, and `MD` is common, > the two sides `KM`, `MD` are equal to the two sides `BM`, `MD` respectively; and the angle `KMD` is equal to the angle `BMD`; > therefore the base `DK` is equal to the base `DB`. [elem.1.4]
- I say that no other straight line equal to the straight line `DK` will fall on the circle from the point `D`.
- For, if possible, let a straight line so fall, and let it be `DN`. > Then, since `DK` is equal to `DN`,
- while `DK` is equal to `DB`, > `DB` is also equal to `DN`, that is, the nearer to the least `DG` equal to the more remote: which was proved impossible.
- Therefore no more than two equal straight lines will fall on the circle `ABC` from the point `D`, one on each side of `DG` the least.
- Therefore etc.


# elem.3.9

`If a point be taken within a circle`, `and more than two equal straight lines fall from the point on the circle`, `the point taken is the centre of the circle`.

- Let `ABC` be a circle and `D` a point within it, and from `D` let more than two equal straight lines, namely `DA`, `DB`, `DC`, fall on the circle `ABC`; I say that the point `D` is the centre of the circle `ABC`.
- For let `AB`, `BC` be joined and bisected at the points `E`, `F`, and let `ED`, `FD` be joined and drawn through to the points `G`, `K`, `H`, `L`.
- Then, since `AE` is equal to `EB`, and `ED` is common, > the two sides `AE`, `ED` are equal to the two sides `BE`, `ED`; and the base `DA` is equal to the base `DB`; > therefore the angle `AED` is equal to the angle `BED`. [elem.1.8]
- Therefore each of the angles `AED`, `BED` is right; [elem.1.def.10] therefore `GK` cuts `AB` into two equal parts and at right angles.
- And since, if in a circle a straight line cut a straight line into two equal parts and at right angles, the centre of the circle is on the cutting straight line, [elem.3.1.p.1] > the centre of the circle is on `GK`.

- Then, since in the circle `ABC` a straight line `AC` cuts a straight line `BH` into two equal parts and at right angles, > the centre of the circle `ABC` is on `AC`. [elem.3.1.p.1]
- Again, since in the same circle `ABC` a straight line `NO` cuts a straight line `BG` into two equal parts and at right angles, > the centre of the circle `ABC` is on `NO`.
- But it was also proved to be on `AC`, and the straight lines `AC`, `NO` meet at no point except at `P`; > therefore the point `P` is the centre of the circle `ABC`.
- Similarly we can prove that `P` is also the centre of the circle `DEF`; > therefore the two circles `ABC`, `DEF` which cut one another have the same centre `P`: which is impossible. [elem.3.5]

`If two circles touch one another internally`, `and their centres be taken`, `the straight line joining their centres`, `if it be also produced`, `will fall on the point of contact of the circles`.

- For let the two circles `ABC`, `ADE` touch one another internally at the point `A`, and let the centre `F` of the circle `ABC`, and the centre `G` of `ADE`, be taken; I say that the straight line joined from `G` to `F` and produced will fall on `A`.
- For suppose it does not, but, if possible, let it fall as `FGH`, and let `AF`, `AG` be joined.
- Then, since `AG`, `GF` are greater than `FA`, that is, than `FH`,
- let `FG` be subtracted from each; therefore the remainder `AG` is greater than the remainder `GH`.
- But `AG` is equal to `GD`; > therefore `GD` is also greater than `GH`, the less than the greater: which is impossible.
- Therefore the straight line joined from `F` to `G` will not fall outside; > therefore it will fall at `A` on the point of contact.

# elem.3.12

`If two circles touch one another externally`, `the straight line joining their centres will pass through the point of contact`.

- For let the two circles `ABC`, `ADE` touch one another `A`, and let the centre `F` of `ABC`, and the centre `G` of `ADE`, be taken; `F` to `G` will pass through the point of contact at `A`.
- For suppose it does not, `FCDG`, and let `AF`, `AG` be joined.

- Again, since the point `G` is the centre of the circle `ADE`, > `GA` is equal to `GD`.
- But `FA` was also proved equal to `FC`; > therefore `FA`, `AG` are equal to `FC`, `GD`, so that the whole `FG` is greater than `FA`, `AG`; but it is also less [elem.1.20]: which is impossible.

`A circle does not touch a circle at more points than one`, `whether it touch it internally or externally`.

- For, if possible, let the circle `ABDC` touch the circle `EBFD`, first internally, at more `D`, `B`.
- Let the centre `G` of the circle `ABDC`, and the centre `H` of `EBFD`, be taken.
- Therefore the straight line `G` to `H` will fall on `B`, `D`. [elem.3.11]
- Let it so fall, as `BGHD`.
- Then, since the point `G` is the centre of the circle `ABCD`, > `BG` is equal to `GD`;

- I say further that neither does it so touch it externally.
- For, if possible, let the circle `ACK` touch the circle `ABDC` at more points than one, namely `A`, `C`, and let `AC` be joined.
- Then, since on the circumference of each of the circles `ABDC`, `ACK` two points `A`, `C` have been taken at random, the straight line joining the points will fall within each circle; [elem.3.2] > but it fell within the circle `ABCD` and outside `ACK` [elem.3.def.3]: which is absurd.

- For let the centre of the circle `ABDC` be taken [elem.3.1], `E`; from `E` let `EF`, `EG` be drawn perpendicular to `AB`, `CD`, and let `AE`, `EC` be joined.
- Then, since a straight line `EF` through the centre cuts a straight line `AB` not through the centre at right angles, it also bisects it. [elem.3.3] > Therefore `AF` is equal to `FB`; therefore `AB` is double of `AF`.

- And, since `AE` is equal to `EC`, > the square on `AE` is also equal to the square on `EC`. But the squares on `AF`, `EF` are equal to the square on `AE`, for the angle at `F` is right; and the squares on `EG`, `GC` are equal to the square on `EC`, for the angle at `G` is right; [elem.1.47] > therefore the squares on `AF`, `FE` are equal to the squares on `CG`, `GE`, of which the square on `AF` is equal to the square on `CG`, for `AF` is equal to `CG`; > therefore the square on `FE` which remains is equal to the square on `EG`, therefore `EF` is equal to `EG`.
- But in a circle straight lines are said to be equally distant from the centre when the perpendiculars drawn to them from the centre are equal; [elem.3.def.4] > therefore `AB`, `CD` are equally distant from the centre.
- Next, let the straight lines `AB`, `CD` be equally distant from the centre; that is, let `EF` be equal to `EG`.
- I say that `AB` is also equal to `CD`.
- For, with the same construction, we can prove, similarly, that `AB` is double of `AF`, and `CD` of `CG`.
- And, since `AE` is equal to `CE`, > the square on `AE` is equal to the square on `CE`. But the squares on `EF`, `FA` are equal to the square on `AE`, and the squares on `EG`, `GC` equal to the square on `CE`. [elem.1.47]
- Therefore the squares on `EF`, `FA` are equal to the squares on `EG`, `GC`, of which the square on `EF` is equal to the square on `EG`, for `EF` is equal to `EG`; therefore the square on `AF` which remains is equal to the square on `CG`; > therefore `AF` is equal to `CG`.

- Let `ABCD` be a circle, let `AD` be its diameter and `E` the centre; and let `BC` be nearer to the diameter `AD`, and `FG` more remote; I say that `AD` is greatest and `BC` greater than `FG`.
- For from the centre `E` let `EH`, `EK`

- Then, since `BC` is nearer to the centre and `FG` more remote, `EK` is greater than `EH`. [elem.3.def.5]
- Let `EL` be made equal to `EH`, through `L` let `LM` be drawn at right angles to `EK` and carried through to `N`, and let `ME`, `EN`, `FE`, `EG` be joined.

- But `ME`, `EN` are greater than `MN`, [elem.1.20] and `MN` is equal to `BC`; > therefore `AD` is greater than `BC`.
- And, since the two sides `ME`, `EN` are equal to the two sides `FE`, `EG`, and the angle `MEN` greater than the angle `FEG`, therefore the base `MN` is greater than the base `FG`. [elem.1.24]

`The straight line drawn at right angles to the diameter of a circle from its extremity will fall outside the circle`, `and into the space between the straight line and the circumference another straight line cannot be interposed; further the angle of the semicircle is greater`, `and the remaining angle less`, `than any acute rectilineal angle`.

- Let `ABC` be a circle about `D` as centre and `AB` as diameter; `A` at right angles to `AB` from its extremity will fall outside the circle.
- For suppose it does not, but, if possible, let it fall within as `CA`, and let `DC` be joined.
- Since `DA` is equal to `DC`, > the angle `DAC` is also equal to the angle `ACD`. [elem.1.5]
- But the angle `DAC` is right; > therefore the angle `ACD` is also right: thus, in the triangle `ACD`, the two angles `DAC`, `ACD` are equal to two right angles: which is impossible. [elem.1.17]
- Therefore the straight line drawn from the point `A` at right angles to `BA` will not fall within the circle.
- Similarly we can prove that neither will it fall on the circumference; > therefore it will fall outside.
- Let it fall as `AE`; I say next that into the space between the straight line `AE` and the circumference `CHA` another straight line cannot be interposed.
- For, if possible, let another straight line be so interposed, as `FA`, and let `DG` be drawn from the point `D` perpendicular to `FA`.
- Then, since the angle `AGD` is right, > and the angle `DAG` is less than a right angle, `AD` is greater than `DG`. [elem.1.19]

- I say further that the angle of the semicircle contained by the straight line `BA` and the circumference `CHA` is greater than any acute rectilineal angle, and the remaining angle contained by the circumference `CHA` and the straight line `AE` is less than any acute rectilineal angle.
- For, if there is any rectilineal angle greater than the angle contained by the straight line `BA` and the circumference `CHA`, and any rectilineal angle less than the angle contained by the circumference `CHA` and the straight line `AE`, then into the space between the circumference and the straight line `AE` a straight line will be interposed such as will make an angle contained by straight lines which is greater than the angle contained by the straight line `BA` and the circumference `CHA`, and another angle contained by straight lines which is less than the angle contained by the circumference `CHA` and the straight line `AE`.
- But such a straight line cannot be interposed;

- Let `A` be the given point, and `BCD` the given circle; thus it is required to draw from the point `A` a straight line touching the circle `BCD`.
- For let the centre `E` of the circle be taken; [elem.3.1] let `AE` be joined, and with centre `E` and distance `EA` let the circle `AFG` be described; `D` let `DF` be drawn at right angles to `EA`, and let `EF`, `AB` be joined; I say that `AB` has been drawn from the point `A` touching the circle `BCD`.
- For, since `E` is the centre of the circles `BCD`, `AFG`, > `EA` is equal to `EF`, and `ED` to `EB`; therefore the two sides `AE`, `EB` are equal to the two sides `FE`, `ED`: and they contain a common angle, the angle at `E`; > therefore the base `DF` is equal to the base `AB`, and the triangle `DEF` is equal to the triangle `BEA`, and the remaining angles to the remaining angles; [elem.1.4] therefore the angle `EDF` is equal to the angle `EBA`.
- But the angle `EDF` is right; > therefore the angle `EBA` is also right.
- Now `EB` is a radius; and the straight line drawn at right angles to the diameter of a circle, from its extremity, touches the circle; [elem.3.16.p.1] > therefore `AB` touches the circle `BCD`.
- Therefore from the given point `A` the straight line `AB` has been drawn touching the circle `BCD`.


# elem.3.18

`If a straight line touch a circle`, `and a straight line be joined from the centre to the point of contact`, `the straight line so joined will be perpendicular to the tangent`.

- For let a straight line `DE` touch the circle `ABC` at the point `C`, let the centre `F` of the circle `ABC` be taken, and let `FC` be joined from `F` to `C`; I say that `FC` is perpendicular to `DE`.
- For, if not, let `FG` be drawn from `F` perpendicular to `DE`.
- Then, since the angle `FGC` is right, > the angle `FCG` is acute; [elem.1.17] and the greater angle is subtended by the greater side; [elem.1.19] > therefore `FC` is greater than `FG`.
- But `FC` is equal to `FB`; > therefore `FB` is also greater than `FG`, the less than the greater: which is impossible.
- Therefore `FG` is not perpendicular to `DE`.
- Similarly we can prove that neither is any other straight line except `FC`; > therefore `FC` is perpendicular to `DE`.
- Therefore etc. Q. E. D.


# elem.3.19

`If a straight line touch a circle`, `and from the point of contact a straight line be drawn at right angles to the tangent`, `the centre of the circle will be on the straight line so drawn`.

- For let a straight line `DE` touch the circle `ABC` at the point `C`, and from `C` let `CA` be drawn at right angles to `DE`; I say that the centre of the circle is on `AC`.
- For suppose it is not, but, if `F` be the centre, and let `CF` be joined.
- Since a straight line `DE` touches the circle `ABC`, and `FC` has been joined from the centre to the point of contact, > `FC` is perpendicular to `DE`; [elem.3.18] therefore the angle `FCE` is right.
- But the angle `ACE` is also right; > therefore the angle `FCE` is equal to the angle `ACE`, the less to the greater: which is impossible.
- Therefore `F` is not the centre of the circle `ABC`.
- Similarly we can prove that neither is any other point except a point on `AC`.
- Therefore etc. Q. E. D.


# elem.3.20

`In a circle the angle at the centre is double of the angle at the circumference`, `when the angles have the same circumference as base`.

- Let `ABC` be a circle, let the angle `BEC` be an angle `BAC` an angle at the circumference, and let them have the same circumference `BC` as base; I say that the angle `BEC` is double of `BAC`.
- For let `AE` be joined and drawn through to `F`.
- Then, since `EA` is equal to `EB`, > the angle `EAB` is also equal to the `EBA`; [elem.1.5] therefore the angles `EAB`, `EBA` are double of the angle `EAB`.
- But the angle `BEF` is equal to the angles `EAB`, `EBA`; [elem.1.32] therefore the angle `BEF` is also double of the angle `EAB`.
- For the same reason > the angle `FEC` is also double of the angle `EAC`.
- Therefore the whole angle `BEC` is double of the whole angle `BAC`.
- Again let another straight line be inflected, and let there be another angle `BDC`; let `DE` be joined and produced to `G`.
- Similarly then we can prove that the angle `GEC` is double of the angle `EDC`, > of which the angle `GEB` is double of the angle `EDB`; therefore the angle `BEC` which remains is double of the angle `BDC`.
- Therefore etc. Q. E. D.


# elem.3.21

`In a circle the angles in the same segment are equal to one another`.

- Let `ABCD` be a circle, and let the angles `BAD`, `BED` be angles in the same segment `BAED`; I say that the angles `BAD`, `BED` are equal to one another.
- For let the centre of the circle `ABCD` be taken, and let it be `F`; let `BF`, `FD` be joined.
- Now, since the angle `BFD` is at the centre, > and the angle `BAD` at the circumference, and they have the same circumference `BCD` as base, therefore the angle `BFD` is double of the angle `BAD`. [elem.3.20]
- For the same reason > the angle `BFD` is also double of the angle `BED`; therefore the angle `BAD` is equal to the angle `BED`.
- Therefore etc. Q. E. D.


# elem.3.22

`The opposite angles of quadrilaterals in circles are equal to two right angles`.

- Let `ABCD` be a circle, and let `ABCD` be a quadrilateral in it; I say that the opposite angles are equal to two right angles.
- Let `AC`, `BD` be joined.
- Then, since in any triangle the three angles are equal to two right angles, [elem.1.32] > the three angles `CAB`, `ABC`, `BCA` of the triangle `ABC` are equal to two right angles.
- But the angle `CAB` is equal to the angle `BDC`, for they are in the same segment `BADC`; [elem.3.21] and the angle `ACB` is equal to the angle `ADB`, for they are in the same segment `ADCB`; therefore the whole angle `ADC` is equal to the angles `BAC`, `ACB`.
- Let the angle `ABC` be added to each; therefore the angles `ABC`, `BAC`, `ACB` are equal to the angles `ABC`, `ADC`. But the angles `ABC`, `BAC`, `ACB` are equal to two right angles; therefore the angles `ABC`, `ADC` are also equal to two right angles.
- Similarly we can prove that the angles `BAD`, `DCB` are also equal to two right angles.
- Therefore etc. Q. E. D.


# elem.3.23

`On the same straight line there cannot be constructed two similar and unequal segments of circles on the same side`.

- For, if possible, on the same straight line `AB` let two similar and unequal segments of circles `ACB`, `ADB` be constructed on the same side; `ACD` be drawn through, and let `CB`, `DB` be joined.
- Then, since the segment `ACB` is similar to the segment `ADB`, elem.3.def.11] > the angle `ACB` is equal to the angle `ADB`, the exterior to the interior: which is impossible. [elem.1.16]
- Therefore etc. Q. E. D.


# elem.3.24

`Similar segments of circles on equal straight lines are equal to one another`.

- For let `AEB`, `CFD` be similar segments of circles on equal straight lines `AB`, `CD`; `AEB` is equal to the segment `CFD`.
- For, if the segment `AEB` be applied to `CFD`, and if the point `A` be placed on `C` and the straight line `AB` on `CD`, > the point `B` will also coincide with the point `D`, because `AB` is equal to `CD`;
       > and, `AB` coinciding with `CD`, the segment `AEB` will also coincide with `CFD`.
- For, if the straight line `AB` coincide with `CD` but the segment `AEB` do not coincide with `CFD`, it will either fall with it, or outside it; `CGD`, and a circle cuts a circle at more points than two : which is impossible. [elem.3.10]
- Therefore, if the straight line `AB` be applied to `CD`, the segment `AEB` will not fail to coincide with `CFD` also; > therefore it will coincide with it and will be equal to it.
- Therefore etc. Q. E. D.


# elem.3.25

`Given a segment of a circle`, `to describe the complete circle of which it is a segment`.

- Let `ABC` be the given segment of a circle; thus it is required to describe the complete circle belonging to the segment `ABC`, that is, of which it is a segment.
- For let `AC` be bisected at `D`, let `DB` be drawn from the point `D` at right angles to `AC`, and let `AB`. be joined; > the angle `ABD` is then greater than, equal to, or less than the angle `BAD`.
- First let it be greater; and on the straight line `BA`, and at the point `A` on it, let the angle `BAE` be constructed equal to the angle `ABD`; let `DB` be drawn through to `E`, and let `EC` be joined.
- Then, since the angle `ABE` is equal to the angle `BAE`, > the straight line `EB` is also equal to `EA`. [elem.1.6]
- And, since `AD` is equal to `DC`, and `DE` is common, > the two sides `AD`, `DE` are equal to the two sides `CD`, `DE` respectively; and the angle `ADE` is equal to the angle `CDE`, for each is right; > therefore the base `AE` is equal to the base `CE`.
- But `AE` was proved equal to `BE`; > therefore `BE` is also equal to `CE`; therefore the three straight lines `AE`, `EB`, `EC` are equal to one another.
- Therefore the circle drawn with centre `E` and distance one of the straight lines `AE`, `EB`, `EC` will also pass through the remaining points and will have been completed. [elem.3.9]
- Therefore, given a segment of a circle, the complete circle has been described.
- And it is manifest that the segment `ABC` is less than a semicircle, because the centre `E` happens to be outside it.
- Similarly, even if the angle `ABD` be equal to the angle `BAD`, `AD` being equal to each of the two `BD`, `DC`, > the three straight lines `DA`, `DB`, `DC` will be equal to one another, `D` will be the centre of the completed circle, and `ABC` will clearly be a semicircle.
- But, if the angle `ABD` be less than the angle `BAD`, and if we construct, on the straight line `BA` and at the point `A` on it, an angle equal to the angle `ABD`, the centre will fall on `DB` within the segment `ABC`, and the segment `ABC` will clearly be greater than a semicircle.
- Therefore, given a segment of a circle, the complete circle has been described. Q. E. F.


# elem.3.26

`In equal circles equal angles stand on equal circumferences`, `whether they stand at the centres or at the circumferences`.

- Let `ABC`, `DEF` be equal circles, and in them let there be equal angles, namely at the centres the angles `BGC`, `EHF`, and at the circumferences the angles `BAC`, `EDF`; I say that the circumference `BKC` is equal to the circumference `ELF`.
- For let `BC`, `EF` be joined.
- Now, since the circles `ABC`, `DEF` are equal, > the radii are equal.
- Thus the two straight lines `BG`, `GC` are equal to the two straight lines `EH`, `HF`; > and the angle at `G` is equal to the angle at `H`; therefore the base `BC` is equal to the base `EF`. [elem.1.4]
- And, since the angle at `A` is equal to the angle at `D`, > the segment `BAC` is similar to the segment `EDF`; [elem.3.def.11] and they are upon equal straight lines.
- But similar segments of circles on equal straight lines are equal to one another; [elem.3.24] > therefore the segment `BAC` is equal to `EDF`. But the whole circle `ABC` is also equal to the whole circle `DEF`; therefore the circumference `BKC` which remains is equal to the circumference `ELF`.
- Therefore etc. Q. E. D.


# elem.3.27

`In equal circles angles standing on equal circumferences are equal to one another`, `whether they stand at the centres or at the circumferences`.

- For in equal circles `ABC`, `DEF`, on equal circumferences `BC`, `EF`, let the angles `BGC`, `EHF` stand at the centres `G`, `H`, and the angles `BAC`, `EDF` at the circumferences; I say that the angle `BGC` is equal to the angle `EHF`, and the angle `BAC` is equal to the angle `EDF`.
- For, if the angle `BGC` is unequal to the angle `EHF`, > one of them is greater. Let the angle `BGC` be greater : and on the straight line `BG`, and at the point `G` on it, let the angle `BGK` be constructed equal to the angle `EHF`. [elem.1.23]
- Now equal angles stand on equal circumferences, when they are at the centres; [elem.3.26] > therefore the circumference `BK` is equal to the circumference `EF`.
- But `EF` is equal to `BC`; > therefore `BK` is also equal to `BC`, the less to the greater : which is impossible.
- Therefore the angle `BGC` is not unequal to the angle `EHF`; > therefore it is equal to it.
- And the angle at `A` is half of the angle `BGC`, > and the angle at `D` half of the angle `EHF`; [elem.3.20] therefore the angle at `A` is also equal to the angle at `D`.
- Therefore etc. Q. E. D.


# elem.3.28

`In equal circles equal straight lines cut off equal circumferences`, `the greater equal to the greater and the less to the less`.

- Let `ABC`, `DEF` be equal circles, and in the circles let `AB`, `DE` be equal straight lines cutting off `ACB`, `DFE` as greater circumferences and `AGB`, `DHE` as lesser; I say that the greater circumference `ACB` is equal to the greater circumference `DFE`, and the less circumference `AGB` to `DHE`.
- For let the centres `K`, `L` of the circles be taken, and let `AK`, `KB`, `DL`, `LE` be joined.
- Now, since the circles are equal, > the radii are also equal; therefore the two sides `AK`, `KB` are equal to the two sides `DL`, `LE`; and the base `AB` is equal to the base `DE`; > therefore the angle `AKB` is equal to the angle `DLE`. [elem.1.8]
- But equal angles stand on equal circumferences, when they are at the centres; [elem.3.26] > therefore the circumference `AGB` is equal to `DHE`.
- And the whole circle `ABC` is also equal to the whole circle `DEF`; therefore the circumference `ACB` which remains is also equal to the circumference `DFE` which remains.
- Therefore etc. Q. E. D.


# elem.3.29

`In equal circles equal circumferences are subtended by equal straight lines`.

- Let `ABC`, `DEF` be equal circles, and in them let equal circumferences `BGC`, `EHF` be cut off; and let the straight lines `BC`, `EF` be joined; I say that `BC` is equal to `EF`.
- For let the centres of the circles be taken, and let them be `K`, `L`; let `BK`, `KC`, `EL`, `LF` be joined.
- Now, since the circumference `BGC` is equal to the circumference `EHF`, > the angle `BKC` is also equal to the angle `ELF`. [elem.3.27]
- And, since the circles `ABC`, `DEF` are equal, > the radii are also equal; therefore the two sides `BK`, `KC` are equal to the two sides `EL`, `LF`; and they contain equal angles; therefore the base `BC` is equal to the base `EF`. [elem.1.4]
- Therefore etc.


# elem.3.30

`To bisect a given circumference`.

- Let `ADB` be the given circumference; thus it is required to bisect the circumference `ADB`.
- Let `AB` be joined and bisected at `C`; from the point `C` let `CD` be drawn at right angles to the straight line `AB`, `AD`, `DB` be joined.
- Then, since `AC` is equal to `CB`, and `CD` is common, > the two sides `AC`, `CD` are equal to the two sides `BC`, `CD`; and the angle `ACD` is equal to the angle `BCD`, for each is right; > therefore the base `AD` is equal to the base `DB`. [elem.1.4]
- But equal straight lines cut off equal circumferences, the greater equal to the greater, and the less to the less; [elem.3.28] > and each of the circumferences `AD`, `DB` is less than a semicircle; therefore the circumference `AD` is equal to the circumference `DB`.
- Therefore the given circumference has been bisected at the point `D`. Q. E. F.


# elem.3.31

`In a circle the angle in the semicircle is right`, `that in a greater segment less than a right angle`, `and that in a less segment greater than a right angle; and further the angle of the greater segment is greater than a right angle`, `and the angle of the less segment less than a right angle`.

- Let `ABCD` be a circle, let `BC` be its diameter, and `E` its centre, and let `BA`, `AC`, `AD`, `DC` be joined; I say that the angle `BAC` in the semicircle `BAC` is right, the angle `ABC` in the segment `ABC` greater than the semicircle is less `ADC` in the segment `ADC` less than the semicircle is greater than a right angle.
- Let `AE` be joined, and let `BA` be carried through to `F`.
- Then, since `BE` is equal to `EA`, > the angle `ABE` is also equal to the angle `BAE`. [elem.1.5]
- Again, since `CE` is equal to `EA`, > the angle `ACE` is also equal to the angle `CAE`. [elem.1.5]
- Therefore the whole angle `BAC` is equal to the two angles `ABC`, `ACB`.
- But the angle `FAC` exterior to the triangle `ABC` is also equal to the two angles `ABC`, `ACB`; [elem.1.32] > therefore the angle `BAC` is also equal to the angle `FAC`; therefore each is right; [elem.1.def.10] therefore the angle `BAC` in the semicircle `BAC` is right.
- Next, since in the triangle `ABC` the two angles `ABC`, `BAC` are less than two right angles, [elem.1.17] and the angle `BAC` is a right angle, > the angle `ABC` is less than a right angle; and it is the angle in the segment `ABC` greater than the semicircle.
- Next, since `ABCD` is a quadrilateral in a circle, and the opposite angles of quadrilaterals in circles are equal to two right angles, [elem.3.22] while the angle `ABC` is less than a right angle, therefore the angle `ADC` which remains is greater than a right angle; and it is the angle in the segment `ADC` less than the semicircle.
- I say further that the angle of the greater segment, namely that contained by the circumference `ABC` and the straight line `AC`, is greater than a right angle; and the angle of the less segment, namely that contained by the circumference `ADC` and the straight line `AC`, is less than a right angle.
- This is at once manifest. For, since the angle contained by the straight lines `BA`, `AC` is right, > the angle contained by the circumference `ABC` and the straight line `AC` is greater than a right angle.
- Again, since the angle contained by the straight lines `AC`, `AF` is right, > the angle contained by the straight line `CA` and the circumference `ADC` is less than a right angle.
- Therefore etc. Q. E. D.


# elem.3.32

`If a straight line touch a circle`, `and from the point of contact there be drawn across`, `in the circle`, `a straight line cutting the circle`, `the angles which it makes with the tangent will be equal to the angles in the alternate segments of the circle`.

- For let a straight line `EF` touch the circle `ABCD` at the point `B`, and from the point `B` let there be drawn across, in the circle `ABCD`, a straight line `BD` cutting it; I say that the angles which `BD` makes with the tangent `EF` will be equal to the angles in the alternate segments of the `FBD` is equal to the angle constructed in the segment `BAD`, and the angle `EBD` is equal to the angle constructed in the segment `DCB`.
- For let `BA` be drawn from `B` at right angles to `EF`, let a point `C` be taken at random on the circumference `BD`, `AD`, `DC`, `CB` be joined.
- Then, since a straight line `EF` touches the circle `ABCD` at `B`, and `BA` has been drawn from the point of contact at right angles to the tangent, the centre of the circle `ABCD` is on `BA`. [elem.3.19]
- Therefore `BA` is a diameter of the circle `ABCD`; > therefore the angle `ADB`, being an angle in a semicircle, is right. [elem.3.31]
- Therefore the remaining angles `BAD`, `ABD` are equal to one right angle. [elem.1.32]
- But the angle `ABF` is also right; therefore the angle `ABF` is equal to the angles `BAD`, `ABD`.
- Let the angle `ABD` be subtracted from each; therefore the angle `DBF` which remains is equal to the angle `BAD` in the alternate segment of the circle.
- Next, since `ABCD` is a quadrilateral in a circle, its opposite angles are equal to two right angles. [elem.3.22]
- But the angles `DBF`, `DBE` are also equal to two right angles; therefore the angles `DBF`, `DBE` are equal to the angles `BAD`, `BCD`, > of which the angle `BAD` was proved equal to the angle `DBF`; therefore the angle `DBE` which remains is equal to the angle `DCB` in the alternate segment `DCB` of the circle.
- Therefore etc. Q. E. D.


# elem.3.33

`On a given straight line to describe a segment of a circle admitting an angle equal to a given rectilineal angle`.

- Let `AB` be the given straight line, and the angle at `C` the given rectilineal angle; thus it is required to describe on the given straight line `AB` a segment of a circle admitting an angle equal to the angle at `C`.
- The angle at `C` is then acute, or right, or obtuse.
- First let it be acute, and, as in the first figure, on the straight line `AB`, and at the point `A`, let the angle `BAD` be constructed equal to the angle at `C`; > therefore the angle `BAD` is also acute.
- Let `AE` be drawn at right angles to `DA`, let `AB` be `F`, let `FG` be drawn from the point `F` at right angles to `AB`, and let `GB` be joined.
- Then, since `AF` is equal to `FB`, and `FG` is common, > the two sides `AF`, `FG` are equal to the two sides `BF`, `FG`; and the angle `AFG` is equal to the angle `BFG`; > therefore the base `AG` is equal to the base `BG`. [elem.1.4]
- Therefore the circle described with centre `G` and distance `GA` will pass through `B` also.
- Let it be drawn, and let it be `ABE`; let `EB` be joined.
- Now, since `AD` is drawn from `A`, the extremity of the diameter `AE`, at right angles to `AE`, > therefore `AD` touches the circle `ABE`. [elem.3.16.p.1]
- Since then a straight line `AD` touches the circle `ABE`, and from the point of contact at `A` a straight line `AB` is drawn across in the circle `ABE`, > the angle `DAB` is equal to the angle `AEB` in the alternate segment of the circle. [elem.3.32]
- But the angle `DAB` is equal to the angle at `C`; therefore the angle at `C` is also equal to the angle `AEB`.
- Therefore on the given straight line `AB` the segment `AEB` of a circle has been described admitting the angle `AEB` equal to the given angle, the angle at `C`.
- Next let the angle at `C` be right; `AB` a segment of a circle admitting an angle equal to the right angle at `C`.
- Let the angle `BAD` be constructed equal to the right angle at `C`, as is the case in the second figure; `AB` be bisected at `F`, and with centre `F` and distance either `FA` or `FB` let the circle `AEB` be described.
- Therefore the straight line `AD` touches the circle `ABE`, because the angle at `A` is right. [elem.3.16.p.1]
- And the angle `BAD` is equal to the angle in the segment `AEB`, for the latter too is itself a right angle, being an angle in a semicircle. [elem.3.31]
- But the angle `BAD` is also equal to the angle at `C`.
- Therefore the angle `AEB` is also equal to the angle at `C`.
- Therefore again the segment `AEB` of a circle has been described on `AB` admitting an angle equal to the angle at `C`.
- Next, let the angle at `C` be obtuse; `AB`, and at the point `A`, let the angle `BAD` be constructed equal to it, as is the case in the third figure; let `AE` be drawn at right angles to `AD`, let `AB` be again bisected at `F`, let `FG` be drawn at right angles to `AB`, and let `GB` be joined.
- Then, since `AF` is again equal to `FB`, and `FG` is common, > the two sides `AF`, `FG` are equal to the two sides `BF`, `FG`; and the angle `AFG` is equal to the angle `BFG`; > therefore the base `AG` is equal to the base `BG`. [elem.1.4]
- Therefore the circle described with centre `G` and distance `GA` will pass through `B` also; let it so pass, as `AEB`.
- Now, since `AD` is drawn at right angles to the diameter `AE` from its extremity, > `AD` touches the circle `AEB`. [elem.3.16.p.1]
- And `AB` has been drawn across from the point of contact at `A`; > therefore the angle `BAD` is equal to the angle constructed in the alternate segment `AHB` of the circle. [elem.3.32]
- But the angle `BAD` is equal to the angle at `C`.
- Therefore the angle in the segment `AHB` is also equal to the angle at `C`.
- Therefore on the given straight line `AB` the segment `AHB` of a circle has been described admitting an angle equal to the angle at `C`. Q. E. F.


# elem.3.34

`From a given circle to cut off a segment admitting an angle equal to a given rectilineal angle`.

- Let `ABC` be the given circle, and the angle at `D` the given rectilineal angle; thus it is required to cut off from the circle `ABC` a segment admitting an angle equal to the given rectilineal angle, the angle at `D`.
- Let `EF` be drawn touching `ABC` at the point `B`, and on the straight line `FB`, and at the point `B` on it, let the angle `FBC` be constructed equal to the angle at `D`. [elem.1.23]
- Then, since a straight line `EF` touches the circle `ABC`, > and `BC` has been drawn across from the point of contact at `B`, the angle `FBC` is equal to the angle constructed in the alternate segment `BAC`. [elem.3.32]
- But the angle `FBC` is equal to the angle at `D`; > therefore the angle in the segment `BAC` is equal to the angle at `D`.
- Therefore from the given circle `ABC` the segment `BAC`. has been cut off admitting an angle equal to the given rectilineal angle, the angle at `D`. Q. E. F.


# elem.3.35

`If in a circle two straight lines cut one another`, `the rectangle contained by the segments of the one is equal to the rectangle contained by the segments of the other`.

- For in the circle `ABCD` let the two straight lines `AC`, `BD` cut one another at the point `E`; I say that the rectangle contained by `AE`, `EC` is equal to the rectangle contained by `DE`, `EB`.
- If now `AC`, `BD` are through the centre, so that `E` is the centre of the circle `ABCD`, it is manifest that, `AE`, `EC`, `DE`, `EB` being equal, the rectangle contained by `AE`, `EC` is also equal to the rectangle contained by `DE`, `EB`.
- Next let `AC`, `DB` not be through the centre; let the centre of `ABCD` be taken, and let it be `F`; from `F` let `FG`, `FH` be drawn perpendicular to the straight lines `AC`, `DB`, and let `FB`, `FC`, `FE` be joined.
- Then, since a straight line `GF` through the centre cuts a straight line `AC` not through the centre at right angles, > it also bisects it; [elem.3.3] therefore `AG` is equal to `GC`.
- Since, then, the straight line `AC` has been cut into equal parts at `G` and into unequal parts at `E`, the rectangle contained by `AE`, `EC` together with the square on `EG` is equal to the square on `GC`; [elem.2.5]
- Let the square on `GF` be added; therefore the rectangle `AE`, `EC` together with the squares on `GE`, `GF` is equal to the squares on `CG`, `GF`.
- But the square on `FE` is equal to the squares on `EG`, `GF`, and the square on `FC` is equal to the squares on `CG`, `GF`; [elem.1.47] > therefore the rectangle `AE`, `EC` together with the square on `FE` is equal to the square on `FC`.
- And `FC` is equal to `FB`; therefore the rectangle `AE`, `EC` together with the square on `EF` is equal to the square on `FB`.
- For the same reason, also, the rectangle `DE`, `EB` together with the square on `FE` is equal to the square on `FB`.
- But the rectangle `AE`, `EC` together with the square on `FE` was also proved equal to the square on `FB`; therefore the rectangle `AE`, `EC` together with the square on `FE` is equal to the rectangle `DE`, `EB` together with the square on `FE`.
- Let the square on `FE` be subtracted from each; therefore the rectangle contained by `AE`, `EC` which remains is equal to the rectangle contained by `DE`, `EB`.
- Therefore etc.

- For let a point `D` be taken outside the circle `ABC`, and from `D` let the two straight lines `DCA`, `DB` fall on the circle `ABC`; let `DCA` cut the circle `ABC` and let `BD` touch it; I say that the rectangle contained by `AD`, `DC` is equal to the square on `DB`.
- Then `DCA` is either through the centre or not through the centre.
- First let it be through the centre, and let `F` be the centre of the circle `ABC`; let `FB` be joined; > therefore the angle `FBD` is right. [elem.3.18]
- And, since `AC` has been bisected at `F`, and `CD` is added to it, the rectangle `AD`, `DC` together with the square on `FC` is equal to the square on `FD`. [elem.2.6]
- But `FC` is equal to `FB`; therefore the rectangle `AD`, `DC` together with the square on `FB` is equal to the square on `FD`.
- And the squares on `FB`, `BD` are equal to the square on `FD`; [elem.1.47] therefore the rectangle `AD`, `DC` together with the square on `FB` is equal to the squares on `FB`, `BD`.
- Let the square on `FB` be subtracted from each; therefore the rectangle `AD`, `DC` which remains is equal to the square on the tangent `DB`.
- Again, let `DCA` not be through the centre of the circle `ABC`; let the centre `E` be taken, and from `E` let `EF` be drawn perpendicular to `AC`; let `EB`, `EC`, `ED` be joined.
- Then the angle `EBD` is right. [elem.3.18]
- And, since a straight line `EF` through the centre cuts a straight line `AC` not through the centre at right angles, > it also bisects it; [elem.3.3] therefore `AF` is equal to `FC`.
- Now, since the straight line `AC` has been bisected at the point `F`, and `CD` is added to it, the rectangle contained by `AD`, `DC` together with the square on `FC` is equal to the square on `FD`. [elem.2.6]
- Let the square on `FE` be added to each; therefore the rectangle `AD`, `DC` together with the squares on `CF`, `FE` is equal to the squares on `FD`, `FE`.
- But the square on `EC` is equal to the squares on `CF`, `FE`, for the angle `EFC` is right; [elem.1.47] and the square on `ED` is equal to the squares on `DF`, `FE`; therefore the rectangle `AD`, `DC` together with the square on `EC` is equal to the square on `ED`.
- And `EC` is equal to `EB`; therefore the rectangle `AD`, `DC` together with the square on `EB` is equal to the square on `ED`.
- But the squares on `EB`, `BD` are equal to the square on `ED`, for the angle `EBD` is right; [elem.1.47] therefore the rectangle `AD`, `DC` together with the square on `EB` is equal to the squares on `EB`, `BD`.
- Let the square on `EB` be subtracted from each; therefore the rectangle `AD`, `DC` which remains is equal to the square on `DB`.
- Therefore etc. Q. E. D.


# elem.3.37

`If a point be taken outside a circle and from the point there fall on the circle two straight lines`, `if one of them cut the circle`, `and the other fall on it`, `and if further the rectangle contained by the whole of the straight line which cuts `, `the straight line which falls on it will touch the circle`.

- For let a point `D` be taken outside the circle `ABC`; from `D` let the two straight lines `DCA`, `DB` fall on the circle `ACB`; let `DCA` cut the circle and `DB` fall on it; and let the rectangle `AD`, `DC` be equal to the square on `DB`.
- I say that `DB` touches the circle `ABC`.
- For let `DE` be drawn touching `ABC`; let the centre of the circle `ABC` be taken, and let it be `F`; let `FE`, `FB`, `FD` be joined.
- Thus the angle `FED` is right. [elem.3.18]
- Now, since `DE` touches the circle `ABC`, and `DCA` cuts it, the rectangle `AD`, `DC` is equal to the square on `DE`. [elem.3.36]
- But the rectangle `AD`, `DC` was also equal to the square on `DB`; therefore the square on `DE` is equal to the square on `DB`; > therefore `DE` is equal to `DB`.
- And `FE` is equal to `FB`; therefore the two sides `DE`, `EF` are equal to the two sides `DB`, `BF`; and `FD` is the common base of the triangles; > therefore the angle `DEF` is equal to the angle `DBF`. [elem.1.8]
- But the angle `DEF` is right; > therefore the angle `DBF` is also right.
- And `FB` produced is a diameter; and the straight line drawn at right angles to the diameter of a circle, from its extremity, touches the circle; [elem.3.16.p.1] > therefore `DB` touches the circle.
- Similarly this can be proved to be the case even if the centre be on `AC`.
- Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
