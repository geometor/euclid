`Into a given circle to fit a straight line equal to a given straight line which is not greater than the diameter of the circle`.

- Let `ABC` be the given circle, and `D` the given straight line not greater than the diameter of the circle; thus it is required to fit into the circle `ABC` a straight line equal to the straight line `D`.
- Let a diameter `BC` of the circle `ABC` be drawn.
- Then, if `BC` is equal to `D`, that which was enjoined will have been done; for `BC` has been fitted into the circle `ABC` equal to the straight line `D`.
- But, if `BC` is greater than `D`, let `CE` be made equal to `D`, and with centre `C` and distance `CE` let the circle `EAF` be described; let `CA` be joined.
- Then, since the point `C` is the centre of the circle `EAF`, > `CA` is equal to `CE`.

- Then, since a straight line `AH` touches the circle `ABC`, and from the point of contact at `A` the straight line `AC` is drawn across in the circle, therefore the angle `HAC` is equal to the angle `ABC` in the alternate segment of the circle. [elem.3.32]
- But the angle `HAC` is equal to the angle `DEF`; therefore the angle `ABC` is also equal to the angle `DEF`.
- For the same reason > the angle `ACB` is also equal to the angle `DFE`; therefore the remaining angle `BAC` is also equal to the remaining angle `EDF`. [elem.1.32]

- And, since the four angles of the quadrilateral `AMBK` are equal to four right angles, inasmuch as `AMBK` is in fact divisible into two triangles, > and the angles `KAM`, `KBM` are right,
       `AKB`, `AMB` are equal to two right angles.
- But the angles `DEG`, `DEF` are also equal to two right angles; [elem.1.13] therefore the angles `AKB`, `AMB` are equal to the angles `DEG`, `DEF`, of which the angle `AKB` is equal to the angle `DEG`; > therefore the angle `AMB` which remains is equal to the angle `DEF` which remains.
- Similarly it can be proved that the angle `LNB` is also `DFE`; > therefore the remaining angle `MLN` is equal to the angle `EDF`. [elem.1.32]

- First let them meet within at `F`, and let `FB`, `FC`, `FA` be joined.
- Then, since `AD` is equal to `DB`, and `DF` is common and at right angles, therefore the base `AF` is equal to the base `FB`. [elem.1.4]
- Similarly we can prove that > `CF` is also equal to `AF`; so that `FB` is also equal to `FC`; > therefore the three straight lines `FA`, `FB`, `FC` are equal to one another.

- Let it be circumscribed, as `ABC`.
- Next, let `DF`, `EF` meet on the straight line `BC` at `F`, as is the case in the second figure; and let `AF` be joined.

- For, if the circle cuts `AB`, `BC`, `CD`, `DA`, the straight line drawn at right angles to the diameter of the circle from its extremity will fall within the circle : which was proved absurd; [elem.3.16] therefore the circle described with centre `G` and distance one of the straight lines `GE`, `GF`, `GH`, `GK` will not cut the straight lines `AB`, `BC`, `CD`, `DA`.

[elem.4.1]
- Let `AD`, `DC` be joined, and let the circle `ACD` be circumscribed about the triangle `ACD`. [elem.4.5]
- Then, since the rectangle `AB`, `BC` is equal to the square on `AC`, and `AC` is equal to `BD`, therefore the rectangle `AB`, `BC` is equal to the square on `BD`.
- And, since a point `B` has been taken outside the circle `ACD`, and from `B` the two straight lines `BA`, `BD` have fallen on the circle `ACD`, and one of them cuts it, while the other falls on it, and the rectangle `AB`, `BC` is equal to the square on `BD`, > therefore `BD` touches the circle `ACD`. [elem.3.37]
- Since, then, `BD` touches it, and `DC` is drawn across from the point of contact at `D`, therefore the angle `BDC` is equal to the angle `DAC` in the alternate segment of the circle. [elem.3.32]
- Since, then, the angle `BDC` is equal to the angle `DAC`, let the angle `CDA` be added to each; therefore the whole angle `BDA` is equal to the two angles `CDA`, `DAC`.

- But the angle `BDA` is equal to the angle `CBD`, since the side `AD` is also equal to `AB`; [elem.1.5] so that the angle `DBA` is also equal to the angle `BCD`.

- And, since `FB` is equal to `FC`, and `FK` common, > the two sides `BF`, `FK` are equal to the two sides `CF`, `FK`; and the base `BK` equal to the base `CK`; therefore the angle `BFK` is equal to the angle `KFC`, [elem.1.8] and the angle `BKF` to the angle `FKC`.

- Then, since `BC` is equal to `CD`, and `CF` common, the two sides `BC`, `CF` are equal to the two sides `DC`, `CF`; `BCF` is equal to the angle `DCF`; > therefore the base `BF` is equal to the base `DF`, and the triangle `BCF` is equal to the triangle `DCF`, and the remaining angles will be equal to the remaining angles, namely those which the equal sides subtend. [elem.1.4]
- Therefore the angle `CBF` is equal to the angle `CDF`.
- And, since the angle `CDE` is double of the angle `CDF`, and the angle `CDE` is equal to the angle `ABC`, while the angle `CDF` is equal to the angle `CBF`; therefore the angle `CBA` is also double of the angle `CBF`; > therefore the angle `ABF` is equal to the angle `FBC`; therefore the angle `ABC` has been bisected by the straight line `BF`.

- Now let `FG`, `FH`, `FK`, `FL`, `FM` be drawn from the point `F` perpendicular to the straight lines `AB`, `BC`, `CD`, `DE`, `EA`.
- Then, since the angle `HCF` is equal to the angle `KCF`, and the right angle `FHC` is also equal to the angle `FKC`, `FHC`, `FKC` are two triangles having two angles equal to two angles and one side equal to one side, namely `FC` which is common to them and subtends one of the equal angles; therefore they will also have the remaining sides equal to the remaining sides; [elem.1.26] therefore the perpendicular `FH` is equal to the perpendicular `FK`.
- Similarly it can be proved that each of the straight lines `FL`, `FM`, `FG` is also equal to each of the straight lines `FH`, `FK`; `FG`, `FH`, `FK`, `FL`, `FM` are equal to one another.

- Now, since the angle `BCD` is equal to the angle `CDE`, and the angle `FCD` is half of the angle `BCD`, and the angle `CDF` half of the angle `CDE`, therefore the angle `FCD` is also equal to the angle `CDF`, > so that the side `FC` is also equal to the side `FD`. [elem.1.6]
- Similarly it can be proved that each of the straight lines `FB`, `FA`, `FE` is also equal to each of the straight lines `FC`, `FD`; therefore the five straight lines `FA`, `FB`, `FC`, `FD`, `FE` are equal to one another.
- Therefore the circle described with centre `F` and distance one of the straight lines `FA`, `FB`, `FC`, `FD`, `FE` will pass also through the remaining points, and will have been circumscribed.
- Let it be circumscribed, and let it be `ABCDE`.
- Therefore about the given pentagon, which is equilateral and equiangular, a circle has been circumscribed. Q. E. F.

`In a given circle to inscribe an equilateral and equiangular hexagon`.

- Let `ABCDEF` be the given circle; thus it is required to inscribe an equilateral and equiangular hexagon in the circle `ABCDEF`.
- Let the diameter `AD` of the circle `ABCDEF` be drawn; let the centre `G` of the circle be taken, and with centre `D` and distance `DG` let the circle `EGCH` be described; `EG`, `CG` be joined and carried through to the points `B`, `F`, and let `AB`, `BC`, `CD`, `DE`, `EF`, `FA` be joined.
- I say that the hexagon `ABCDEF` is equilateral and equiangular.
- For, since the point `G` is the centre of the circle `ABCDEF`, > `GE` is equal to `GD`.
- Again, since the point `D` is the centre of the circle `GCH`, > `DE` is equal to `DG`.
- But `GE` was proved equal to `GD`; > therefore `GE` is also equal to `ED`; therefore the triangle `EGD` is equilateral; and therefore its three angles `EGD`, `GDE`, `DEG` are equal to one another, inasmuch as, in isosceles triangles, the angles at the base are equal to one another. [elem.1.5]
- And the three angles of the triangle are equal to two right angles; [elem.1.32] > therefore the angle `EGD` is one-third of two right angles.
- Similarly, the angle `DGC` can also be proved to be onethird of two right angles.
- And, since the straight line `CG` standing on `EB` makes the adjacent angles `EGC`, `CGB` equal to two right angles, therefore the remaining angle `CGB` is also one-third of two right angles.
- Therefore the angles `EGD`, `DGC`, `CGB` are equal to one another; so that the angles vertical to them, the angles `BGA`, `AGF`, `FGE` are equal. [elem.1.15]
- Therefore the six angles `EGD`, `DGC`, `CGB`, `BGA`, `AGF`, `FGE` are equal to one another.
- But equal angles stand on equal circumferences; [elem.3.26] therefore the six circumferences `AB`, `BC`, `CD`, `DE`, `EF`, `FA` are equal to one another.
- And equal circumferences are subtended by equal straight lines; [elem.3.29] > therefore the six straight lines are equal to one another; therefore the hexagon `ABCDEF` is equilateral.
- I say next that it is also equiangular.
- For, since the circumference `FA` is equal to the circumference `ED`, > let the circumference `ABCD` be added to each; therefore the whole `FABCD` is equal to the whole `EDCBA`;
       `FED` stands on the circumference `FABCD`, and the angle `AFE` on the circumference `EDCBA`; > therefore the angle `AFE` is equal to the angle `DEF`. [elem.3.27]
- Similarly it can be proved that the remaining angles of the hexagon `ABCDEF` are also severally equal to each of the angles `AFE`, `FED`; > therefore the hexagon `ABCDEF` is equiangular.
- But it was also proved equilateral; and it has been inscribed in the circle `ABCDEF`.
- Therefore in the given circle an equilateral and equiangular hexagon has been inscribed. Q. E. F.


# elem.4.16

`In a given circle to inscribe a fifteen-angled figure which shall be both equilateral and equiangular`.

- Let `ABCD` be the given circle; thus it is required to inscribe in the circle `ABCD` a fifteenangled figure which shall be both equilateral and equiangular.
- In the circle `ABCD` let there be inscribed a side `AC` of the equilateral triangle inscribed in it, and a side `AB` of an equilateral pentagon; therefore, of the equal segments of which there are fifteen in the circle `ABCD`, there will be five in the circumference `ABC` which is one-third of the circle, and there will be three in the circumference `AB` which is one-fifth of the circle; > therefore in the remainder `BC` there will be two of the equal segments.
- Let `BC` be bisected at `E`; [elem.3.30] therefore each of the circumferences `BE`, `EC` is a fifteenth of the circle `ABCD`.
- If therefore we join `BE`, `EC` and fit into the circle `ABCD` straight lines equal to them and in contiguity, a fifteen-angled figure which is both equilateral and equiangular will have been inscribed in it. Q. E. F.
- And, in like manner as in the case of the pentagon, if through the points of division on the circle we draw tangents to the circle, there will be circumscribed about the circle a fifteen-angled figure which is equilateral and equiangular.
- And further, by proofs similar to those in the case of the pentagon, we can both inscribe a circle in the given fifteenangled figure and circumscribe one about it. Q. E. F.
