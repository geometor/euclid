A > perturbed proportion arises when, there being three magnitudes and another set equal to them in multitude, as antecedent is to consequent among the first magnitudes, so is antecedent to consequent among the second magnitudes, while, as the consequent is to a third among the first magnitudes, so is a third to the antecedent among the second magnitudes.



# elem.5.1

`If there be any number of magnitudes whatever which are`, `respectively`, `equimultiples of any magnitudes equal in multitude`, `then`, `whatever multiple one of the magnitudes is of one`, `that multiple also will all be of all`.

- Let any number of magnitudes whatever `AB`, `CD` be respectively equimultiples of any magnitudes `E`, `F` equal in multitude; I say that, whatever multiple `AB` is of `E`, that multiple will `AB`, `CD` also be of `E`, `F`.
- For, since `AB` is the same multiple of `E` that `CD` is of `F`, as many magnitudes as there are in `AB` equal to `E`, so many also are there in `CD` equal to `F`.
- Let `AB` be divided into the magnitudes `AG`, `GB` equal to `E`, and `CD` into `CH`, `HD` equal to `F`; then the multitude of the magnitudes `AG`, `GB` will be equal to the multitude of the magnitudes `CH`, `HD`.
- Now, since `AG` is equal to `E`, and `CH` to `F`, therefore `AG` is equal to `E`, and `AG`, `CH` to `E`, `F`.
- For the same reason
- `GB` is equal to `E`, and `GB`, `HD` to `E`, `F`; therefore, as many magnitudes as there are in `AB` equal to `E`, so many also are there in `AB`, `CD` equal to `E`, `F`; `AB` is of `E`, that multiple will `AB`, `CD` also be of `E`, `F`.

`If a first magnitude be the same multiple of a second that a third is of a fourth`, `and a fifth also be the same multiple of the second that a sixth is of the fourth`, `the sum of the first and fifth will also be the same multiple of the second that the sum of the third and sixth is of the fourth`.

- Let a first magnitude, `AB`, be the same multiple of a second, `C`, that a third, `DE`, is of a fourth, `F`, and let a fifth, `BG`, also be the same multiple of the second, `C`, that a sixth, `EH`, is of the fourth `F`; `AG`, will be the same multiple of the second, `C`, that the sum of the third and sixth, `DH`, is of the fourth, `F`.
- For, since `AB` is the same multiple of `C` that `DE` is of `F`, therefore, as many magnitudes as there are in `AB` equal to `C`, so many also are there in `DE` equal to `F`.
- For the same reason also, as many as there are in `BG` equal to `C`, so many are there also in `EH` equal to `F`; `AG` equal to `C`, so many also are there in the whole `DH` equal to `F`.
- Therefore, whatever multiple `AG` is of `C`, that multiple also is `DH` of `F`.
- Therefore the sum of the first and fifth, `AG`, is the same multiple of the second, `C`, that the sum of the third and sixth, `DH`, is of the fourth, `F`.

# elem.5.3

`If a first magnitude be the same multiple of a second that a third is of a fourth`, `and if equimultiples be taken of the first and third`, `then also` ex aequali `the magnitudes taken will be equimultiples respectively`, `the one of the second and the other of the fourth`.

- Let a first magnitude `A` be the same multiple of a second `B` that a third `C` is of a fourth `D`, and let equimultiples `EF`, `GH` be taken of `A`, `C`; I say that `EF` is the same multiple of `B` that `GH` is of `D`.
- For, since `EF` is the same multiple of `A` that `GH` is of `C`, therefore, as many magnitudes as there are in `EF` equal to `A`, so many also are there in `GH` equal to `C`.
- Let `EF` be divided into the magnitudes `EK`, `KF` equal to `A`, and `GH` into the magnitudes `GL`, `LH` equal to `C`; then the multitude of the magnitudes `EK`, `KF` will be equal to the multitude of the magnitudes `GL`, `LH`.
- And, since `A` is the same multiple of `B` that `C` is of `D`, while `EK` is equal to `A`, and `GL` to `C`, therefore `EK` is the same multiple of `B` that `GL` is of `D`.
- For the same reason
- `KF` is the same multiple of `B` that `LH` is of `D`.
- Since, then, a first magnitude `EK` is the same multiple of a second `B` that a third `GL` is of a fourth `D`, and a fifth `KF` is also the same multiple of the second `B` that a sixth `LH` is of the fourth `D`, therefore the sum of the first and fifth, `EF`, is also the same multiple of the second `B` that the sum of the third and sixth, `GH`, is of the fourth `D`.

`If a first magnitude have to a second the same ratio as a third to a fourth`, `any equimultiples whatever of the first and third will also have the same ratio to any equimultiples whatever of the second and fourth respectively`, `taken in corresponding order`.

- For let a first magnitude `A` have to a second `B` the same ratio as a third `C` to a fourth `D`; and let equimultiples `E`, `F` be taken of `A`, `C`, and `G`, `H` other, chance, equimultiples of `B`, `D`; I say that, as `E` is to `G`, so is `F` to `H`.
- For let equimultiples `K`, `L` be taken of `E`, `F`, and other, chance, equimultiples `M`, `N` of `G`, `H`.
- Since `E` is the same multiple of `A` that `F` is of `C`, and equimultiples `K`, `L` of `E`, `F` have been taken, therefore `K` is the same multiple of `A` that `L` is of `C`. [elem.5.3]
- For the same reason > `M` is the same multiple of `B` that `N` is of `D`.
- And, since, as `A` is to `B`, so is `C` to `D`, and of `A`, `C` equimultiples `K`, `L` have been taken, and of `B`, `D` other, chance, equimultiples `M`, `N`, therefore, if `K` is in excess of `M`, `L` also is in excess of `N`, if it is equal, equal, and if less, less. [elem.5.def.5]
- And `K`, `L` are equimultiples of `E`, `F`, and `M`, `N` other, chance, equimultiples of `G`, `H`; therefore, as `E` is to `G`, so is `F` to `H`. [elem.5.def.5]

# elem.5.5

`If a magnitude be the same multiple of a magnitude that a part subtracted is of a part subtracted`, `the remainder will also be the same multiple of the remainder that the whole is of the whole`.

- For let the magnitude `AB` be the same multiple of the magnitude `CD` that the part `AE` subtracted is of the part `CF` subtracted; I say that the remainder `EB` is also the same multiple of the remainder `FD` that the whole `AB` is of the whole `CD`.
- For, whatever multiple `AE` is of `CF`, let `EB` be made that multiple of `CG`.
- Then, since `AE` is the same multiple of `CF` that `EB` is of `GC`, therefore `AE` is the same multiple of `CF` that `AB` is of `GF`. [elem.5.1]
- But, by the assumption, `AE` is the same multiple of `CF` that `AB` is of `CD`.
- Therefore `AB` is the same multiple of each of the magnitudes `GF`, `CD`; > therefore `GF` is equal to `CD`.
- Let `CF` be subtracted from each; therefore the remainder `GC` is equal to the remainder `FD`.
- And, since `AE` is the same multiple of `CF` that `EB` is of `GC`, and `GC` is equal to `DF`, `AE` is the same multiple of `CF` that `EB` is of `FD`.
- But, by hypothesis,
- `AE` is the same multiple of `CF` that `AB` is of `CD`; therefore `EB` is the same multiple of `FD` that `AB` is of `CD`.
- That is, the remainder `EB` will be the same multiple of `FD` that the whole `AB` is of the whole `CD`.
- Therefore etc. Q. E. D.


# elem.5.6

`If two magnitudes be equimultiples of two magnitudes`, `and any magnitudes subtracted from them be equimultiples of the same`, `the remainders also are either equal to the same or equimultiples of them`.

- For let two magnitudes `AB`, `CD` be equimultiples of two magnitudes `E`, `F`, and let `AG`, `CH` subtracted from them be equimultiples of the same two `E`, `F`; `GB`, `HD`, are either equal to `E`, `F` or equimultiples of them.
- For, first, let `GB` be equal to `E`; I say that `HD` is also equal to `F`.
- For let `CK` be made equal to `F`.
- Since `AG` is the same multiple of `E` that `CH` is of `F`, while `GB` is equal to `E` and `KC` to `F`, therefore `AB` is the same multiple of `E` that `KH` is of `F`. [elem.5.2]
- But, by hypothesis, `AB` is the same multiple of `E` that `CD` is of `F`; therefore `KH` is the same multiple of `F` that `CD` is of `F`.
- Since then each of the magnitudes `KH`, `CD` is the same multiple of `F`, > therefore `KH` is equal to `CD`.
- Let `CH` be subtracted from each; therefore the remainder `KC` is equal to the remainder `HD`.
- But `F` is equal to `KC`; therefore `HD` is also equal to `F`.
- Hence, if `GB` is equal to `E`, `HD` is also equal to `F`.
- Similarly we can prove that, even if `GB` be a multiple of `E`, `HD` is also the same multiple of `F`.
- Therefore etc. Q. E. D.


# elem.5.7

`Equal magnitudes have to the same the same ratio`, `as also has the same to equal magnitudes`.

- Let `A`, `B` be equal magnitudes and `C` any other, chance, magnitude; I say that each of the magnitudes `A`, `B` has the same ratio to `C`, and `C` has the same ratio to each of the magnitudes `A`, `B`.
- For let equimultiples `D`, `E` of `A`, `B` be taken, and of `C` another, chance, multiple `F`.
- Then, since `D` is the same multiple of `A` that `E` is of `B`, while `A` is equal to `B`, > therefore `D` is equal to `E`.
- But `F` is another, chance, magnitude.
- If therefore `D` is in excess of `F`, `E` is also in excess of `F`, if equal to it, equal; and, if less, less.
- And `D`, `E` are equimultiples of `A`, `B`, while `F` is another, chance, multiple of `C`; > therefore, as `A` is to `C`, so is `B` to `C`. [elem.5.def.5]
- I say next that `C` also has the same ratio to each of the magnitudes `A`, `B`.
- For, with the same construction, we can prove similarly that `D` is equal to `E`; and `F` is some other magnitude.
- If therefore `F` is in excess of `D`, it is also in excess of `E`, if equal, equal; and, if less, less.
- And `F` is a multiple of `C`, while `D`, `E` are other, chance, equimultiples of `A`, `B`; > therefore, as `C` is to `A`, so is `C` to `B`. [elem.5.def.5]
- Therefore etc.


# elem.5.8

`Of unequal magnitudes`, `the greater has to the same a greater ratio than the less has`; `and the same has to the less a greater ratio than it has to the greater`.

- Let `AB`, `C` be unequal magnitudes, and let `AB` be greater; let `D` be another, chance, magnitude; I say that `AB` has to `D` a greater ratio than `C` has to `D`, and `D` has to `C` a greater ratio than it has to `AB`.
- For, since `AB` is greater than `C`, let `BE` be made equal to `C`; then the less of the magnitudes `AE`, `EB`, if multiplied, will sometime be greater than `D`. [elem.5.def.4]
- [ I.]
- First, let `AE` be less than `EB`; let `AE` be multiplied, and let `FG` be a multiple of it which is greater than `D`; then, whatever multiple `FG` is of `AE`, let `GH` be made the same multiple of `EB` and `K` of `C`; and let `L` be taken double of `D`, `M` triple of it, and successive multiples increasing by one, until what is taken is a multiple of `D` and the first that is greater than `K`. Let it be taken, and let it be `N` which is quadruple of `D` and the first multiple of it that is greather than `K`.
- Then, since `K` is less than `N` first, therefore `K` is not less than `M`.
- And, since `FG` is the same multiple of `AE` that `GH` is of `EB`, therefore `FG` is the same multiple of `AE` that `FH` is of `AB`. [elem.5.1]
- But `FG` is the same multiple of `AE` that `K` is of `C`; > therefore `FH` is the same multiple of `AB` that `K` is of `C`; therefore `FH`, `K` are equimultiples of `AB`, `C`.
- Again, since `GH` is the same multiple of `EB` that `K` is of `C`, and `EB` is equal to `C`, > therefore `GH` is equal to `K`.
- But `K` is not less than `M`; > therefore neither is `GH` less than `M`.
- And `FG` is greater than `D`; therefore the whole `FH` is greater than `D`, `M` together.
- But `D`, `M` together are equal to `N`, inasmuch as `M` is triple of `D`, and `M`, `D` together are quadruple of `D`, while `N` is also quadruple of `D`; whence `M`, `D` together are equal to `N`.
- But `FH` is greater than `M`, `D`; > therefore `FH` is in excess of `N`, while `K` is not in excess of `N`.
- And `FH`, `K` are equimultiples of `AB`, `C`, while `N` is another, chance, multiple of `D`; > therefore `AB` has to `D` a greater ratio than `C` has to `D`. [elem.5.def.7]
- I say next, that `D` also has to `C` a greater ratio than `D` has to `AB`.
- For, with the same construction, we can prove similarly that `N` is in excess of `K`, while `N` is not in excess of `FH`.
- And `N` is a multiple of `D`, while `FH`, `K` are other, chance, equimultiples of `AB`, `C`; > therefore `D` has to `C` a greater ratio than `D` has to `AB`. [elem.5.def.7]
- [ 2.]
- Again, let `AE` be greater than `EB`.
- Then the less, `EB`, if multiplied, will sometime be greater than `D`. [elem.5.def.4]
- Let it be multiplied, and let `GH` be a multiple of `EB` and greater than `D`; and, whatever multiple `GH` is of `EB`, let `FG` be made the same multiple of `AE`, and `K`
       `C`.
- Then we can prove similarly that `FH`, `K` are equimultiples of `AB`, `C`; and, similarly, let `N` be taken a multiple of `D` but the first that is greater than `FG`, so that `FG` is again not less than `M`.
- But `GH` is greater than `D`; therefore the whole `FH` is in excess of `D`, `M`, that is, of `N`.
- Now `K` is not in excess of `N`, inasmuch as `FG` also, which is greater than `GH`, that is, than `K`, is not in excess of `N`.
- And in the same manner, by following the above argument, we complete the demonstration.
- Therefore etc. Q. E. D.

- But we saw that, if `H` was in excess of `M`, `G` was also in excess of `L`; if equal, equal; and if less, less; so that, in addition, if `G` is in excess of `L`, `K` is also in excess of `N`, if equal, equal, and if less, less.

- For, since there are some equimultiples of `C`, `E`, and of `D`, `F` other, chance, equimultiples, such that the multiple of `C` is in excess of the multiple of `D`, `E` is not in excess of the multiple of `F`, [elem.5.def.7] let them be taken, and let `G`, `H` be equimultiples of `C`, `E`, and `K`, `L` other, chance, equimultiples of `D`, `F`, so that `G` is in excess of `K`, but `H` is not in excess of `L`; and, whatever multiple `G` is of `C`, let `M` be also that multiple of `A`, and, whatever multiple `K` is of `D`, let `N` be also that multiple of `B`.

- For, since `AB` is the same multiple of `C` that `DE` is of `F`, as many magnitudes as there are in `AB` equal to `C`, so many are there also in `DE` equal to `F`.
- Let `AB` be divided into the magnitudes `AG`, `GH`, `HB` equal to `C`, and `DE` into the magnitudes `DK`, `KL`, `LE` equal to `F`; then the multitude of the magnitudes `AG`, `GH`, `HB` will be equal to the multitude of the magnitudes `DK`, `KL`, `LE`.

- Therefore, as one of the antecedents is to one of the consequents, so will all the antecedents be to all the consequents; [elem.5.12] > therefore, as `AG` is to `DK`, so is `AB` to `DE`.
- But `AG` is equal to `C` and `DK` to `F`; > therefore, as `C` is to `F`, so is `AB` to `DE`.

`If four magnitudes be proportional`, `they will also be proportional alternately`.

- Let `A`, `B`, `C`, `D` be four proportional magnitudes, so that, as `A` is to `B`, so is `C` to `D`; I say that they will also be so alternately, that is, as `A` is to `C`, so is `B` to `D`.
- For of `A`, `B` let equimultiples `E`, `F` be taken, and of `C`, `D` other, chance, equimultiples `G`, `H`.
- Then, since `E` is the same multiple of `A` that `F` is of `B`, and parts have the same ratio as the same multiples of them, [elem.5.15] therefore, as `A` is to `B`, so is `E` to `F`.
- But as `A` is to `B`, so is `C` to `D`; therefore also, as `C` is to `D`, so is `E` to `F`. [elem.5.11]
- Again, since `G`, `H` are equimultiples of `C`, `D`, therefore, as `C` is to `D`, so is `G` to `H`. [elem.5.15]
- But, as `C` is to `D`, so is `E` to `F`; therefore also, as `E` is to `F`, so is `G` to `H`. [elem.5.11]
- But, if four magnitudes be proportional, and the first be greater than the third, > the second will also be greater than the fourth; if equal, equal; and if less, less. [elem.5.14]
- Therefore, if `E` is in excess of `G`, `F` is also in excess of `H`, if equal, equal, and if less, less.
- Now `E`, `F` are equimultiples of `A`, `B`, and `G`, `H` other, chance, equimultiples of `C`, `D`; > therefore, as `A` is to `C`, so is `B` to `D`. [elem.5.def.5]

# elem.5.17

`If magnitudes be proportional`
       , `they will also be proportional`
       .

- Let `AB`, `BE`, `CD`, `DF` be magnitudes proportional , so that, as `AB` is to `BE`, so is `CD` to `DF`; I say that they will also be proportional , that is, as `AE` is to `EB`, so is `CF` to `DF`.
- For of `AE`, `EB`, `CF`, `FD` let equimultiples `GH`, `HK`, `LM`, `MN` be taken, and of `EB`, `FD` other, chance, equimultiples, `KO`, `NP`.
- Then, since `GH` is the same multiple of `AE` that `HK` is of `EB`, therefore `GH` is the same multiple of `AE` that `GK` is of `AB`. [elem.5.1]
- But `GH` is the same multiple of `AE` that `LM` is of `CF`; therefore `GK` is the same multiple of `AB` that `LM` is of `CF`.
- Again, since `LM` is the same multiple of `CF` that `MN` is of `FD`, therefore `LM` is the same multiple of `CF` that `LN` is of `CD`. [elem.5.1]
- But `LM` was the same multiple of `CF` that `GK` is of `AB`; therefore `GK` is the same multiple of `AB` that `LN` is of `CD`.
- Therefore `GK`, `LN` are equimultiples of `AB`, `CD`.
- Again, since `HK` is the same multiple of `EB` that `MN` is of `FD`, > and `KO` is also the same multiple of `EB` that `NP` is of `FD`, therefore the sum `HO` is also the same multiple of `EB` that `MP` is of `FD`. [elem.5.2]
- And, since, as `AB` is to `BE`, so is `CD` to `DF`, and of `AB`, `CD` equimultiples `GK`, `LN` have been taken, and of `EB`, `FD` equimultiples `HO`, `MP`, therefore, if `GK` is in excess of `HO`, `LN` is also in excess of `MP`, if equal, equal, and if less, less.
- Let `GK` be in excess of `HO`; then, if `HK` be subtracted from each, > `GH` is also in excess of `KO`.
- But we saw that, if `GK` was in excess of `HO`, `LN` was also in excess of `MP`; > therefore `LN` is also in excess of `MP`,
       `MN` be subtracted from each, > `LM` is also in excess of `NP`; so that, if `GH` is in excess of `KO`, `LM` is also in excess of `NP`.
- Similarly we can prove that, if `GH` be equal to `KO`, `LM` will also be equal to `NP`, and if less, less.
- And `GH`, `LM` are equimultiples of `AE`, `CF`, while `KO`, `NP` are other, chance, equimultiples of `EB`, `FD`; > therefore, as `AE` is to `EB`, so is `CF` to `FD`.
- Therefore etc. Q. E. D.


# elem.5.18

`If magnitudes be proportional`
       , `they will also be proportional`
       .

- Let `AE`, `EB`, `CF`, `FD` be magnitudes proportional , so that, as `AE` is to `EB`, so is `CF` to `FD`; , that is, as `AB` is to `BE`, so is `CD` to `FD`.
- For, if `CD` be not to `DF` as `AB` to `BE`, then, as `AB` is to `BE`, so will `CD` be either to some magnitude less than `DF` or to a greater.
- First, let it be in that ratio to a less magnitude `DG`.
- Then, since, as `AB` is to `BE`, so is `CD` to `DG`, they are magnitudes proportional ; > so that they will also be proportional . [elem.5.17]
- Therefore, as `AE` is to `EB`, so is `CG` to `GD`.
- But also, by hypothesis, > as `AE` is to `EB`, so is `CF` to `FD`.
- Therefore also, as `CG` is to `GD`, so is `CF` to `FD`. [elem.5.11]
- But the first `CG` is greater than the third `CF`; > therefore the second `GD` is also greater than the fourth `FD`. [elem.5.14]
- But it is also less: which is impossible.
- Therefore, as `AB` is to `BE`, so is not `CD` to a less magnitude than `FD`.
- Similarly we can prove that neither is it in that ratio to a greater; > it is therefore in that ratio to `FD` itself.
- Therefore etc. Q. E. D.


# elem.5.19

`If, as a whole is to a whole, so is a part subtracted to a part subtracted`, `the remainder will also be to the remainder as whole to whole`.

- For, as the whole `AB` is to the whole `CD`, so let the part `AE` subtracted be to the part `CF` subtracted; I say that the remainder `EB` will also be to the remainder `FD` as the whole `AB` to the whole `CD`.
- For since, as `AB` is to `CD`, so is `AE` to `CF`, alternately also, as `BA` is to `AE`, so is `DC` to `CF`. [elem.5.16]
- And, since the magnitudes are proportional `componendo`, they will also be proportional `separando`, [elem.5.17] that is, as `BE` is to `EA`, so is `DF` to `CF`, and, alternately, > as `BE` is to `DF`, so is `EA` to `FC`. [elem.5.16]
- But, as `AE` is to `CF`, so by hypothesis is the whole `AB` to the whole `CD`.
- Therefore also the remainder `EB` will be to the remainder `FD` as the whole `AB` is to the whole `CD`. [elem.5.11]
- Therefore etc.

- For, since `A` is greater than `C`, and `B` is some other magnitude, and the greater has to the same a greater ratio than the less has, [elem.5.8] therefore `A` has to `B` a greater ratio than `C` has to `B`.
- But, as `A` is to `B`, so is `D` to `E`, and, as `C` is to `B`, inversely, so is `F` to `E`; therefore `D` has also to `E` a greater ratio than `F` has to `E`. [elem.5.13]
- But, of magnitudes which have a ratio to the same, that which has a greater ratio is greater; [elem.5.10] > therefore `D` is greater than `F`.

       ; I say that `D` will also be greater than `F`; if `A` is equal to `C`, equal; and if less, less.
- For, since `A` is greater than `C`, and `B` is some other magnitude, therefore `A` has to `B` a greater ratio than `C` has to `B`. [elem.5.8]
- But, as `A` is to `B`, so is `E` to `F`, and, as `C` is to `B`, inversely, so is `E` to `D`. Therefore also `E` has to `F` a greater ratio than `E` has to `D`. [elem.5.13]
- But that to which the same has a greater ratio is less; [elem.5.10] > therefore `F` is less than `D`; therefore `D` is greater than `F`.

- For of `A`, `D` let equimultiples `G`, `H` be taken, and of `B`, `E` other, chance, equimultiples `K`, `L`; and, further, of `C`, `F` other, chance, equimultiples `M`, `N`.
- Then, since, as `A` is to `B`, so is `D` to `E`, and of `A`, `D` equimultiples `G`, `H` have been taken, and of `B`, `E` other, chance, equimultiples `K`, `L`, > therefore, as `G` is to `K`, so is `H` to `L`. [elem.5.4]

- Of `A`, `B`, `D` let equimultiples `G`, `H`, `K` be taken, and of `C`, `E`, `F` other, chance, equimultiples `L`, `M`, `N`.
- Then, since `G`, `H` are equimultiples of `A`, `B`, and parts have the same ratio as the same multiples of them, [elem.5.15] > therefore, as `A` is to `B`, so is `G` to `H`.
