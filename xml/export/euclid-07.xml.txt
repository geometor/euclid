> Two unequal numbers being set out, and the less being continually subtracted in turn from the greater, if the number which is left never measures the one before it until an unit is left, the original numbers will be prime to one another.

- For, the less of two unequal numbers > AB, > CD being continually subtracted from the greater, let the number which is left never measure the one before it until an unit is left; I say that > AB, > CD are prime to one another, that is, that an unit alone measures > AB, > CD.

- Let a number measure them, and let it be > E; let > CD, measuring > BF, leave > FA less than itself, let > AF, measuring > DG, leave > GC less than itself, and let > GC, measuring > FH, leave an unit > HA.
- Since, then, > E measures > CD, and > CD measures > BF, therefore > E also measures > BF.
- But it also measures the whole > BA; therefore it will also measure the remainder > AF.
- But > AF measures > DG; therefore > E also measures > DG.
- But it also measures the whole > DC therefore it will also measure the remainder > CG.
- But > CG measures > FH; therefore > E also measures > FH.
- But it also measures the whole > FA; therefore it will also measure the remainder, the unit > AH, though it is a number: which is impossible.

> Given two numbers not prime to one another, to find their greatest common measure.

- Let > AB, > CD be the two given numbers not prime to one another.
- Thus it is required to find the greatest common measure of > AB, > CD.
- If now > CD measures > AB—and it also measures itself—> CD is a common measure of > CD, > AB.
- And it is manifest that it is also the greatest; for no greater number than > CD will measure > CD.
- But, if > CD does not measure > AB, then, the less of the numbers > AB, > CD being continually subtracted from the greater, some number will be left which will measure the one before it.
- For an unit will not be left; otherwise > AB, > CD will be prime to one another [elem.7.1], which is contrary to the hypothesis.
- Therefore some number will be left which will measure the one before it.
- Now let > CD, measuring > BE, leave > EA less than itself, let > EA, measuring > DF, leave > FC less than itself, and let > CF measure > AE.
- Since then, > CF measures > AE, and > AE measures > DF, therefore > CF will also measure > DF.
- But it also measures itself; therefore it will also measure the whole > CD.
- But > CD measures > BE; therefore > CF also measures > BE.
- But it also measures > EA; therefore it will also measure the whole > BA.
- But it also measures > CD; therefore > CF measures > AB, > CD.
- Therefore > CF is a common measure of > AB, > CD.
- I say next that it is also the greatest.
- For, if > CF is not the greatest common measure of > AB, > CD, some number which is greater than > CF will measure the numbers > AB, > CD.
- Let such a number measure them, and let it be > G.
- Now, since > G measures > CD, while > CD measures > BE, > G also measures > BE.
- But it also measures the whole > BA; therefore it will also measure the remainder > AE.
- But > AE measures > DF; therefore > G will also measure > DF.
- But it also measures the whole > DC; therefore it will also measure the remainder > CF, that is, the greater will measure the less: which is impossible.

- Let such a number measure them, and let it be > E.
- Since then > E measures > A, > B, > C, it will also measure > A, > B; therefore it will also measure the greatest common measure of > A, > B. [elem.7.2.p.1]
- But the greatest common measure of > A, > B is > D; therefore > E measures > D, the greater the less: which is impossible.
- Therefore no number which is greater than > D will measure the numbers > A, > B, > C; > therefore > D is the greatest common measure of > A, > B, > C.
- Next, let > D not measure > C; I say first that > C, > D are not prime to one another.
- For, since > A, > B, > C are not prime to one another, some number will measure them.
- Now that which measures > A, > B, > C will also measure > A, > B, and will measure > D, the greatest common measure of > A, > B. [elem.7.2.p.1]
- But it measures > C also; therefore some number will measure the numbers > D, > C; therefore > D, > C are not prime to one another.

- Then, since > E measures > D, and > D measures > A, > B, therefore > E also measures > A, > B.

- I say next that it is also the greatest.
- For, if > E is not the greatest common measure of > A, > B, > C, some number which is greater than > E will measure the numbers > A, > B, > C.
- Let such a number measure them, and let it be > F.
- Now, since > F measures > A, > B, > C, it also measures > A, > B; therefore it will also measure the greatest common measure of > A, > B. [elem.7.2.p.1]
- But the greatest common measure of > A, > B is > D; therefore > F measures > D.
- And it measures > C also; therefore > F measures > D, > C; therefore it will also measure the greatest common measure of > D, > C. [elem.7.2.p.1]
- But the greatest common measure of > D, > C is > E; therefore > F measures > E, the greater the less: which is impossible.

- But, if not, let the greatest common measure > D of > A, > BC be taken; [elem.7.2] and let > BC be divided into the numbers equal to > D, namely > BE, > EF, > FC.
- Now, since > D measures > A, > D is a part of > A.

- For let the number > A be a part of > BC, and another, > D, the same part of another > EF that > A is of > BC; I say that the sum of > A, > D is also the same part of the sum of > BC, > EF that > A is of > BC.
- For since, whatever part > A is of > BC, > D is also the same part of > EF, therefore, as many numbers as there are in > BC equal to > A, so many numbers are there also in > EF equal to > D.
- Let > BC be divided into the numbers equal to > A, namely > BG, > GC, and > EF into the numbers equal to > D, namely > EH, > HF; then the multitude of > BG, > GC will be equal to the multitude of > EH, > HF.
- And, since > BG is equal to > A, and > EH to > D, therefore > BG, > EH are also equal to > A, > D.
- For the same reason > GC, > HF are also equal to > A, > D.
- Therefore, as many numbers as there are in > BC equal to > A, so many are there also in > BC, > EF equal to > A, > D.
- Therefore, whatever multiple > BC is of > A, the same multiple also is the sum of > BC, > EF of the sum of > A, > D.

- Now > CD is not parts of > A.
- For, if possible, let it be so; therefore > EF is also the same parts of > B that > CD is of > A. [elem.7.13 and elem.7.def.20]
- Therefore, as many parts of > A as there are in > CD, so many parts of > B are there also in > EF.
- Let > CD be divided into the parts of > A, namely > CG, > GD, and > EF into the parts of > B, namely > EH, > HF; thus the multitude of > CG, > GD will be equal to the multitude of > EH, > HF.
- Now, since the numbers > CG, > GD are equal to one another, and the numbers > EH, > HF are also equal to one another, while the multitude of > CG, > GD is equal to the multitude of > EH, > HF, therefore, as > CG is to > EH, so is > GD to > HF.
- Therefore also, as one of the antecedents is to one of the consequents, so will all the antecedents be to all the consequents. [elem.7.12]
- Therefore, as > CG is to > EH, so is > CD to > EF.
- Therefore > CG, > EH are in the same ratio with > CD, > EF, being less than they: which is impossible, for by hypothesis > CD, > EF are the least numbers of those which have the same ratio with them.
- Therefore > CD is not parts of > A; therefore it is a part of it. [elem.7.4]

- And, as many times as > C measures > A, so many units let there be in > D, and, as many times as > C measures > B, so many units let there be in > E
- Since > C measures > A according to the units in > D, therefore > C by multiplying > D has made > A. [elem.7.def.15]
- For the same reason also > C by multiplying > E has made > B.
- Thus the number > C by multiplying the two numbers > D, > E has made > A, > B; therefore, as > D is to > E, so is > A to > B; [elem.7.17] therefore > D, > E are in the same ratio with > A, > B, being less than they: which is impossible.
