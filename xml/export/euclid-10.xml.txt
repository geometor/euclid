# elem.10.def.1

Those magnitudes are said to be > commensurable which are measured by the same measure, and those > incommensurable which cannot have any common measure.



# elem.10.def.2

Straight lines are > commensurable in square when the squares on them are measured by the same area, and > incommensurable in square when the squares on them cannot possibly have any area as a common measure.



# elem.10.def.3

With these hypotheses, it is proved that there exist straight lines infinite in multitude which are commensurable and incommensurable respectively, some in length only, and others in square also, with an assigned straight line. Let then the assigned straight line be called > rational, and those straight lines which are commensurable with it, whether in length and in square or in square only, > rational, but those which are incommensurable with > it irrational.



# elem.10.def.4

And let the square on the assigned straight line be called > rational and those areas which are commensurable with it > rational, but those which are incommensurable with it > irrational, and the straight lines which produce them > irrational, that is, in case the areas are squares, the sides themselves, but in case they are any other rectilineal figures, the straight lines on which are described squares equal to them.

> Two unequal magnitudes being set out, if from the greater there be subtracted a magnitude greater than its half, and from that which is left a magnitude greater than its half, and if this process be repeated continually, there will be left some magnitude which will be less than the lesser magnitude set out.

- Let > AB, C be two unequal magnitudes of which > AB is the greater: I say that, if from > AB there be subtracted a magnitude greater than its half, and from that which is left a magnitude greater than its half, and if this process be repeated continually, there will be left some magnitude which will be less than the magnitude > C.
- For > C if multiplied will sometime be greater than > AB. [cf. elem.5.def.4]
- Let it be multiplied, and let > DE be a multiple of > C, and greater than. > AB; let > DE be divided into the parts > DF, > FG, > GE equal to > C, from > AB let there be subtracted > BH greater than its half, and, from > AH, > HK greater than its half, and let this process be repeated continually until the divisions in > AB are equal in multitude with the divisions in > DE.
- Let, then, > AK, > KH, > HB be divisions which are equal in multitude with > DF, > FG, > GE.
- Now, since > DE is greater than > AB, and from > DE there has been subtracted > EG less than its half, and, from > AB, > BH greater than its half, therefore the remainder > GD is greater than the remainder > HA.
- And, since > GD is greater than > HA, and there has been subtracted, from > GD, the half > GF, and, from > HA, > HK greater than its half, therefore the remainder > DF is greater than the remainder > AK.
- But > DF is equal to > C; therefore > C is also greater than > AK.
- Therefore > AK is less than > C.
- Therefore there is left of the magnitude > AB the magnitude > AK which is less than the lesser magnitude set out, namely > C. Q. E. D.
- And the theorem can be similarly proved even if the parts subtracted be halves.

> If, when the less of two unequal magnitudes is continually subtracted in turn from the greater, that which is left never measures the one before it, the magnitudes will be incommensurable.

- For, there being two unequal magnitudes > AB, > CD, and > AB being the less, when the less is continually subtracted in turn from the greater, let that which is left over never measure the one before it; I say that the magnitudes > AB, > CD are incommensurable.
- For, if they are commensurable, some magnitude will measure them.
- Let a magnitude measure them, if possible, and let it be > E; let > AB, measuring > FD, leave > CF less than itself, let > CF measuring > BG, leave > AG less than itself, and let this process be repeated continually, until there is left some magnitude which is less than > E.
- Suppose this done, and let there be left > AG less than > E.
- Then, since > E measures > AB, while > AB measures > DF, therefore > E will also measure > FD.
- But it measures the whole > CD also; therefore it will also measure the remainder > CF.
- But > CF measures > BG; therefore > E also measures > BG.
- But it measures the whole > AB also; therefore it will also measure the remainder > AG, the greater the less: which is impossible.
- Therefore no magnitude will measure the magnitudes > AB, > CD; therefore the magnitudes > AB, > CD are incommensurable.

> Given two commensurable magnitudes, to find their greatest common measure.

- Let the two given commensurable magnitudes be > AB, > CD of which > AB is the less; thus it is required to find the greatest common measure of > AB, > CD.
- Now the magnitude > AB either measures > CD or it does not.
- If then it measures it—and it measures itself also—> AB is a common measure of > AB, > CD.
- And it is manifest that it is also the greatest; for a greater magnitude than the magnitude > AB will not measure > AB.
- Next, let > AB not measure > CD.
- Then, if the less be continually subtracted in turn from the greater, that which is left over will sometime measure the one before it, because > AB, > CD are not incommensurable; [cf. elem.10.2] let > AB, measuring > ED, leave > EC less than itself, let > EC, measuring > FB, leave > AF less than itself, and let > AF measure > CE.
- Since, then, > AF measures > CE, while > CE measures > FB, therefore > AF will also measure > FB.
- But it measures itself also; therefore > AF will also measure the whole > AB.
- But > AB measures > DE; therefore > AF will also measure > ED.
- But it measures > CE also; therefore it also measures the whole > CD.
- Therefore > AF is a common measure of > AB, > CD.
- I say next that it is also the greatest.
- For, if not, there will be some magnitude greater than > AF which will measure > AB, > CD.
- Let it be > G.
- Since then > G measures > AB, while > AB measures > ED, therefore > G will also measure > ED.
- But it measures the whole > CD also; therefore > G will also measure the remainder > CE.
- But > CE measures > FB; therefore > G will also measure > FB.
- But it measures the whole > AB also, and it will therefore measure the remainder > AF, the greater the less: which is impossible.
- Therefore no magnitude greater than > AF will measure > AB, > CD; therefore > AF is the greatest common measure of > AB, > CD.
- Therefore the greatest common measure of the two given commensurable magnitudes > AB, > CD has been found. Q. E. D.

> Given three commensurable magnitudes, > to find their greatest common measure.

- Let > A, > B, > C be the three given commensurable magnitudes; thus it is required to find the greatest common measure of > A, > B, > C.
- Let the greatest common measure of the two magnitudes > A, > B be taken, and let it be > D; [elem.10.3] then > D either measures > C, or does not measure it.
- First, let it measure it.
- Since then > D measures > C, while it also measures > A, > B, therefore > D is a common measure of > A, > B, > C.
- And it is manifest that it is also the greatest; for a greater magnitude than the magnitude > D does not measure > A, > B.
- Next, let > D not measure > C.
- I say first that > C, > D are commensurable.
- For, since > A, > B, > C are commensurable, some magnitude will measure them, and this will of course measure > A, > B also; so that it will also measure the greatest common measure of > A, > B, namely > D. [elem.10.3.p.1]
- But it also measures > C; so that the said magnitude will measure > C, > D; therefore > C, > D are commensurable.
- Now let their greatest common measure be taken, and let it be > E. [elem.10.3]
- Since then > E measures > D, while > D measures > A, > B, therefore > E will also measure > A, > B.
- But it measures > C also; therefore > E measures > A, > B, > C; therefore > E is a common measure of > A, > B, > C.
- I say next that it is also the greatest.
- For, if possible, let there be some magnitude > F greater than > E, and let it measure > A, > B, > C.
- Now, since > F measures > A, > B, > C, it will also measure > A, > B, and will measure the greatest common measure of > A, > B. [elem.10.3.p.1]
- But the greatest common measure of > A, > B is > D; therefore > F measures > D.
- But it measures > C also; therefore > F measures > C, > D; therefore > F will also measure the greatest common measure of > C, > D. [elem.10.3.p.1]
- But that is > E; therefore > F will measure > E, the greater the less: which is impossible.
- Therefore no magnitude greater than the magnitude > E will measure > A, > B, > C; therefore > E is the greatest common measure of > A, > B, > C if > D do not measure > C, and, if it measure it, > D is itself the greatest common measure.
- Therefore the greatest common measure of the three given commensurable magnitudes has been found.

- For, since > A, > B are commensurable, some magnitude will measure them.
- Let it measure them, and let it be > C.
- And, as many times as > C measures > A, so many units let there be in > D; and, as many times as > C measures > B, so many units let there be in > E.
- Since then > C measures > A according to the units in > D, while the unit also measures > D according to the units in it, therefore the unit measures the number > D the same number of times as the magnitude > C measures > A; therefore, as > C is to > A, so is the unit to > D; [elem.7.def.20] therefore, inversely, as > A is to > C, so is > D to the unit. [cf. elem.5.7.p.1]
- Again, since > C measures > B according to the units in > E, while the unit also measures > E according to the units in it, > E the same number of times as > C measures > B; therefore, as > C is to > B, so is the unit to > E.
- But it was also proved that, > as > A is to > C, so is > D to the unit; therefore, , > as > A is to > B, so is the number > D to > E. [elem.5.22]

- For let the two magnitudes > A, > B have to one another the ratio which the number > D has to the number > E; > A, > B are commensurable.
- For let > A be divided into as many equal parts as there are units in > D, and let > C be equal to one of them; and let > F be made up of as many magnitudes equal to > C as > E.
- Since then there are in > A as many magnitudes equal to > C as there are units in > D, whatever part the unit is of > D, the same part is > C of > A also; therefore, as > C is to > A, so is the unit to > D. [elem.7.def.20]
- But the unit measures the number > D; therefore > C also measures > A.
- And since, as > C is to > A, so is the unit to > D, therefore, inversely, as > A is to > C, so is the number > D to the unit. [cf. elem.5.7.p.1]
- Again, since there are in > F as many magnitudes equal to > C as there are units in > E, therefore, as > C is to > F, so is the unit to > E. [elem.7.def.20]
- But it was also proved that, > as > A is to > C, so is > D to the unit;

- But, as > D is to > E, so is > A to > B; therefore also, as > A is to > B, so is it to > F also. [elem.5.11]
- Therefore > A has the same ratio to each of the magnitudes > B, > F; > B is equal to > F. A[elem.5.9]

- For let there be applied to > DE the rectangle > DH equal to the square on > AC, and > KL equal to the square on > BC; therefore the remainder, twice the rectangle > AC, > CB, is equal to > MF.
- Let > MG be bisected at > N, and let > NO be drawn parallel [to > ML or > GF].

- But, if there be two unequal straight lines, and to the greater there be applied a parallelogram equal to the fourth part of the square on the less and deficient by a square figure, and if it divide it into commensurable parts, the square on the greater is greater than the square on the less by the square on a straight line commensurable with the greater; [elem.10.17] therefore the square on > DM is greater than the square on > MG by the square on a straight line commensurable with > DM.

 of the rectangle > AB, > CD be > G; I say that > G is rational.
- For let a rational straight line > H be set out, and to > CD let there be applied a rectangle equal to the square on > H and producing > KL as breadth.
- Therefore > KL is an apotome.
- Let its terms be > KM, > ML commensurable with the terms > CE, > ED of the binomial straight line and in the same ratio. [elem.10.112]
- But > CE, > ED are also commensurable with > AF, > FB and in the same ratio; therefore, as > AF is to > FB, so is > KM to > ML.
- Therefore, alternately, as > AF is to > KM, so is > BF to > LM; therefore also the remainder > AB is to the remainder > KL as > AF is to > KM. [elem.5.19]
- But > AF is commensurable with > KM; [elem.10.12] therefore > AB is also commensurable with > KL. [elem.10.11]
- And, as > AB is to > KL, so is the rectangle > CD, > AB to the rectangle > CD, > KL; [elem.6.1] therefore the rectangle > CD, > AB is also commensurable with the rectangle > CD, > KL. [elem.10.11]
- But the rectangle > CD, > KL is equal to the square on > H; therefore the rectangle > CD, > AB is commensurable with the square on > H.
- But the square on > G is equal to the rectangle > CD, > AB; therefore the square on > G is commensurable with the square on > H.
- But the square on > H is rational; therefore the square on > G is also rational; therefore > G is rational.
- And it is the 
 of the rectangle > CD, > AB.
- Therefore etc.

> From a medial straight line there arise irrational straight lines infinite in number, and none of them is the same as any of the preceding.

- Let > A be a medial straight line; I say that from > A there arise irrational straight lines infinite in number, and none of them is the same as any of the preceding.
- Let a rational straight line > B be set out, > C be equal to the rectangle > B, > A; therefore > C is irrational; [elem.10.def.4] for that which is contained by an irrational and a rational straight line is irrational. [deduction from elem.10.20]
- And it is not the same with any of the preceding; for the square on none of the preceding, if applied to a rational straight line produces as breadth a medial straight line.
- Again, let the square on > D be equal to the rectangle > B, > C; therefore the square on > D is irrational. [deduction from elem.10.20]
- Therefore > D is irrational; [elem.10.def.4] and it is not the same with any of the preceding, for the square on none of the preceding, if applied to a rational straight line, produces > C as breadth.
- Similarly, if this arrangement proceeds , it is manifest that from the medial straight line there arise irrational straight lines infinite in number, and none is the same with any of the preceding. Q. E. D.
