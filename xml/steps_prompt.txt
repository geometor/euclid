We are revitalizing Euclid's Elements. Starting with xml files of the Heath
edition from the Perseus project, we have been parsing the information of each
proposition in a json file for further analysis. 

The overall goal is to translate Elements from English to Python - forming a
set of hierarchical functions to represent the knowledge of Elements. We are
building geometric constructions with Sympy. And exploring the dependency graph.

We will review the proof steps for each proposition
and begin translating them into a more concise, consistent and rigorous format
like pseudo code.

some context:

the commodities of the system are points
we will always construct (and define) lines and circles from two points
line_AB circle_BA

lines and circles are a projection of a relationship in the field
a finite straight line should be called a segment
a segment is a portion of a line - a pair of points

Conceptually, we have a Model that holds all the elements of a geometric construction.
Models are initialized with two starting points. 
a pair of points can construct one line and two circles.
when new elements added to the model, all new interection points with the existing elements are returned

Model prevents duplication of elements

the following are the enunciation and proof steps for the first proposition
write a function to perform this operation
